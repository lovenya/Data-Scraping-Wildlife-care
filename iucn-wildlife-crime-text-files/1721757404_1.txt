A CEESP Virtual Dialogue took place on the topic of 'Community involvement in preventing and combating wildlife, forest and fisheries crime'' in both English and Spanish. 

Wildlife crimes touch every country, impacting biodiversity, human health, national security, socio-economic development, as well as lining the pockets of organized criminal groups. Illegal trade in wildlife can lead to the spread of zoonoses, such as SARS-CoV-2 that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

The recording is available below, as well as an Infographic summarizing some 1) challenges, 2) lessons learned, 3) recommendations for IUCN, and 4) calls to action.
