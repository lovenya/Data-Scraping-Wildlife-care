At Stellenbosch University in South Africa, the African Wildlife Economy Institute (AWEI) is building a new programme of applied research on the ethical basis, governance, and operation of the wildlife economy.

At the African Leadership University in Rwanda, the School of Wildlife Conservation (SOWC) is undertaking a major research initiative on the state of the wildlife economy on the continent as well as supporting the Kenyan Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife on opportunities beyond tourism.

In both institutions, a focus is community involvement based on securing community rights to manage and utilise wild fauna and flora. Community ownership and benefits are key to preventing and combating wildlife crime. Looking forward, AWEI is starting a project on linking sustainable wild meat to rewilding and landscape restoration to ensure benefits to local communities and SOWC is developing a series of country case studies looking at opportunities for enhancing community livelihoods through responsible wildlife use.
