Cyprus also recently hosted a training course for Middle East countries as part of INTERPOL’s Project Litmus which develops skills to identify, detect, investigate and successfully prosecute those planning, preparing or committing a chemical explosive incident.“No country or region can address today’s crime threats alone,” said the INTERPOL Chief, highlighting illegal immigration as a key area for cooperation.“Cyprus continues to demonstrate its strong commitment to the global law enforcement community as an active and strong INTERPOL member country,” added the Secretary General.The INTERPOL Chief was updated on the increased use by Cyprus of the Organization’s global databases, including nominals, stolen and lost travel documents and stolen motor vehicles by the head of the National Central Bureau (NCB) in Nicosia, Ioannis Charalambous.With the NCB in Nicosia regularly cooperating closely with INTERPOL’s stolen Works of Art unit, the Secretary General also met with the Director of Cyprus’s Antiquities Department.
