“Duplicating information channels, contact points, and operational efforts risks information falling through the cracks. It risks criminals taking advantage of gaps in coordination,” concluded the INTERPOL Chief.Dr Mohammed Ben Ali Koman, AIMC Secretary General said, “The repercussions of globalization, the developments in communication and modern technologies, the increasing presence of the virtual world, and the transnational character of organized crime make us all vulnerable to common challenges.“These cannot be dealt with effectively without uniting all of our efforts in the framework of an effective multilateral policing architecture against global threats.”The series of Dialogue meetings is aimed at building on INTERPOL’s strong belief in the importance of adopting a comprehensive and coordinated global approach to cross-continental security threats.Participating Dialogue members were AFRIPOL, AIMC, AMERIPOL, ASEANAPOL, Europol, FRONTEX, and the Gulf Cooperation Council-POL (GCCPOL), with observers from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, and the UNODC.This is the fifth edition of the Dialogue since its launch in March 2016.
