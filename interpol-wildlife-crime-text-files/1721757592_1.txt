                    The INTERPOL President and the Mayor of Lyon buried a message under the building's foundation stone: "May those who inhabit this building serve the cause of peace and security in the world".
            
“INTERPOL’s work is fundamental in the fight against terrorism, cybercrime and in the fight against all forms of crime, including drug trafficking and human trafficking.“Yes, we are proud to have INTERPOL in Lyon and we strongly support its extension plans.”Welcoming Mr Collomb, Secretary General Jürgen Stock said that Lyon had become much more than a host city for the General Secretariat – it had become a home for the staff and their families.
