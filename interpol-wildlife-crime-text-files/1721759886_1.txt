Timeframe: 2017-2023
Budget: Euro 28 million
Donor: European UnionThe SituationMany of the 16 countries in West Africa sit on the Atlantic Ocean, making the region especially attractive to criminals as a transit hub between Africa, Europe and the Americas.Improving security in West Africa is therefore of global interest, and essential in order to combat the crimes currently affecting the region such as drug trafficking, people smuggling, human trafficking and terrorism.Project aimsThe West Africa Police Information System (WAPIS) Programme is implemented by INTERPOL with funding from the European Union. Its aim is to strengthen information exchange and coordination among the region’s law enforcement agencies in the following ways:Enable police officers in West African countries to access critical police information from their national criminal databases and from databases of countries across the region, thus improving the identification of criminals and supporting ongoing investigations.Improve analysis of the problems of transnational organized crime and terrorism facing the region and allow a better understanding of crime originating in, coming from and transiting through West Africa.Allow greater police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the region, the European Union and the rest of the world.Project activitiesThe programme supports the efforts of national authorities and ECOWAS in improving the security of citizens in West Africa and is being implemented at three levels: national, regional and global.
    
National levelWAPIS provides local law enforcement authorities with an electronic national police information system allowing them to create, manage and share files connected to crimes and offences. Data includes:Criminal cases and events;Suspects, victims and witnesses;Legal proceedings;Weapons and objects;Vehicles;Identity documents.
    
Regional levelNational systems are networked into a regional information sharing platform for police. This allows the instant exchange of authorized police data among countries of the region, thereby enhancing cooperation and rapid police action.Another advantage of this centralized system is that police  can collate crime statistics more easily and analyze trends affecting the region. The insights  are used to develop effective anti-crime strategies.Global levelEach national police data system  is connected to INTERPOL’s secure, global police communications system (I-24/7) through the country’s National Central Bureau. As such, officers can share authorized national data globally and perform checks against INTERPOL’s databases.This capacity has the potential to reveal connections between crimes and criminals that would not previously have been possible. For example, an officer performing a name check on a national suspected of drug trafficking may learn that the individual is wanted by another country, beyond the region, for similar criminal activities.Interconnection via INTERPOL’s I-24/7 helps strengthen the operational link between West African law enforcement and the rest of the world, which is crucial to effectively combating transnational organized crime and terrorism.
    
EU fundingThe Programme has been fully funded by the European Union since its outset in 2012, first under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP),then under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.In July 2015, the EU and ECOWAS agreed to further support the full rollout of the WAPIS System in all ECOWAS countries and Mauritania under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF, EU-West Africa Regional Indicative Programme). EDF support has been available since November 2017 and has been extended beyond the initial 55 months until November 2023. It will cover activities in all ECOWAS countries and Mauritania.Project updates
