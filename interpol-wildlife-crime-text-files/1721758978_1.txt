It is being perpetrated by polycriminal transnational organized crime groups, and includes both fraud operations and money laundering.“We will only match this transnational organized crime through a complete global network – and so it is vital countries work together to tackle these threats internationally through organizations like the G7, but most of all through INTERPOL’s global policing systems.”The Secretary General also highlighted INTERPOL’s work on Black Axe, an organized crime group based in West Africa, but now based in 40 so-called zones worldwide using cyber-enabled criminal activities.The G7 Interior and Security Ministers meeting was attended by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as INTERPOL and the EU.
