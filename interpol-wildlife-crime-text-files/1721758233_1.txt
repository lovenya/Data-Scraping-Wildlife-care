Each of our member countries hosts an INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB). This connects their national law enforcement with other countries and with the General Secretariat via our secure global police communications network called I-24/7. NCBs are at the heart of INTERPOL and how we work. They seek the information needed from other NCBs to help investigate crime or criminals in their own country, and they share criminal data and intelligence to assist another country.    As part of their role in global investigations, NCBs work with: Law enforcement agencies in their own countryOther NCBs and Sub-Bureaus around the worldThe General Secretariat’s offices worldwideNCBs contribute national crime data to our global databases, in accordance with their respective national laws, and cooperate on cross-border investigations, operations and arrests.
