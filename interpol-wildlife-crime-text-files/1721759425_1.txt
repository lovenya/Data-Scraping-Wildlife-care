INTERPOL recognizes the need to prepare the next generation of global police leaders to effectively combat international crime – now and in the future. This is why we set up the Young Global Police Leaders Programme (YGPLP) in 2019.The Programme informs over 35 young police leaders from around the world about emerging trends in policing, and provides them with mentoring from experienced senior officers and qualified experts.Placing an emphasis on innovation, preparedness and agility, the Programme highlights the need to develop a global professional network across law enforcement, as well as to jointly identify potential solutions and recommendations for present law enforcement leaders.
    
        “I believe the voice of young police leaders must be heard at the global scale and this forum is the ideal platform from which we can ensure that this happens today, and in the future.”
        Jürgen Stock, INTERPOL Secretary General
