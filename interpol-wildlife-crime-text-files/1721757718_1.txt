In this respect fostering inter-agency cooperation between all relevant law enforcement agencies involved in border security on land and at sea throughout the region is crucial.”“The Operation combined multiple INTERPOL Counter-Terrorism projects, including the one targeting UN Sanctions, and sought to maximize the use of INTERPOL policing capabilities for regional and interagency cooperation,” said Kiho Cha, Senior Political Affairs Officer with the UN Security Council Subsidiary Organs Branch.“The cooperation between INTERPOL and the UN has already proven its efficiency and added value for the sake of global peace and security. Its future and continuity require the active participation of member states and the exchange of information between INTERPOL National Central Bureaus its Special Representative to the UN and the relevant UN sanctions committees,” added Mr Cha.With the operation representing the culmination of skills and knowledge developed during a series of capacity building activities for law enforcement in the region since May 2015, INTERPOL’s Director of Capacity Building and Training Julia Viedma said: “By bringing together actors across the law enforcement community including key decision makers, investigators, forensic experts, immigration officers as well as NCBs, Operation Sunbird II shows the real operational value of capacity building and training to make a practical difference on the ground.”Since 2013, the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime (SOMTC) has consistently supported INTERPOL in the delivery of capacity building programmes within Southeast Asia.“Through the continuation of our fruitful partnership it will be possible to undertake new joint initiatives to combat terrorism, cybercrime, piracy and other types of organized crime taking place within the region,” said Sieng Lapresse, Government Advisor, Ministry of Interior of  Cambodia and the current Chair of SOMTC.Partner agencies included the INTERPOL National Central Bureaus in ASEAN member countries, law enforcement agencies in ASEAN member states including immigration, police and maritime authorities, ASEANAPOL and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.The 10 ASEAN countries are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
