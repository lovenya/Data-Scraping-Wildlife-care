Fighting organized crime in LuxembourgLuxembourg is a small landlocked country in the heart of Europe bordered by Belgium, Germany and France. Its capital is one of the three official European Union capitals. These geopolitical characteristics, along with its global financial centres and stable high-income market economy make Luxembourg potentially attractive to global organized crime.The organized crime groups which operate in Luxembourg engage principally in drug crime, motor vehicle trafficking and fraud. Associated crimes that also affect Luxembourg are violence and firearms trafficking.The international characteristics of these crimes and their links with organized crime groups around the world make the role of Luxembourg’s INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) fundamental to maintaining national security.
