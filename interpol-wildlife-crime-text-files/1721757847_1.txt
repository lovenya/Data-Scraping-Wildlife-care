Operation Batho, conducted in coordination with the UNODC, brought together Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe to target trafficking in human beings. The December 2018 operation led to the rescue of nearly 90 victims and the arrest of more than 20 suspected traffickers.In addition, Operation Basadi, carried out across all SARPCCO member countries, saw female police officers spearheading an operation targeting violence against women and children resulting in the arrest of some 295 suspects.The INTERPOL Chief said the operational targets were identified following the enhanced analysis capabilities being developed under ENACT: enhancing Africa’s response to transnational organized crime.“INTERPOL’s engagement revolves around a simple, basic principle: global connectivity is a cornerstone of today’s police effectiveness,” said Secretary General Stock.“Criminal flows will hit Southern Africa from across the globe so it is essential that law enforcement officers across the region are empowered with access to information from the rest of the world and the means to analyse it,” added the INTERPOL Chief.
