Always contact your local policeEven if the crime you wish to report is international in nature, you should still approach your local police.Investigations and arrests are always carried out by national and local police forces. Our role is to help your national police to communicate with police in other countries to solve international crimes.So we deal mostly with information provided by police, not the public.Get in touch with the police in your country if:you are a victim of a crime that you think comes from another country;you have information about a crime that has been committed or is being planned;you wish to report a missing person who you think may be in another country.Once you have reported a crime, the police in your country can access INTERPOLâ€™s services and databases if needed.Please do not attempt to report crimes on our social media pages.
