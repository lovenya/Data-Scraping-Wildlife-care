Who benefits from training?Staff in National Central Bureaus (NCBs) and the Secretariat’s Regional Bureaus (RBs) are INTERPOL’s link with national police forces and they are increasingly called upon to play a greater operational role.We ensure that all NCB and RB staff stay up to speed on the crimes they have to tackle. Each year we organize refresher courses on INTERPOL’s tools and services for a wide target audience in our four main regions. Regional Training Officers located in the RBs ensure training is tailored to regional issues.
