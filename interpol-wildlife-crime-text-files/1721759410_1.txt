The body had been there for at least four months, but possibly even for four years. It was no longer possible to establish the cause of death; a crime could not be ruled out. Her identity has always remained a mystery.CharacteristicsExperts reconstructed the woman's face in April 2002. The reconstruction gives an idea of how the woman might have looked. It is assumed that the woman was of mixed descent, partly African, possibly Mongolian. She had curly black hair. Noticeably, her teeth were in very good condition.In a back pocket, the woman carried seven cotton swabs with her. She also carried a few German banknotes with her. The jewellery is also striking. It was found near the place where the body was found and might give a clue to who this young woman might be.Phenotype: African/MongolianContact
