What we doINTERPOL steers a range of initiatives designed to bridge the gap between national and international policing and help law enforcement agencies make maximum use of the varied services we provide.Our global perspective allows us to balance highly specific training on particular subjects with a more cross-cutting approach designed to foster professionalism and sustainability. Courses are overseen by INTERPOL Training Quality Assurance to ensure they systematically meet our standards of excellence.Putting skills into practiceWhere relevant, our courses culminate in field training operations. This enables participants to put into practice the skills they have acquired in a controlled “real-world’ environment and to appreciate their practical value in day-to-day activities.
