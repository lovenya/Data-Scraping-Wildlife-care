            INTERPOL has brought together senior law enforcement leaders from the world’s regional police organizations to discuss ways to coordinate their activities against transnational crime. The meeting at the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore aims to create a strong global policing architecture by clarifying the roles of each organization to identify areas for collaboration and encourage greater information exchange.
    
                                            
    
            INTERPOL welcomes regional policing as an important component of an effective global policing architecture, said INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock. The Head of INTERPOL added that the global nature of crime threats such as cybercrime, terrorism and the movement of foreign terrorist fighters nonetheless requires optimal levels of international police cooperation amongst regional actors.

This is critical especially when the stakes are high, when it comes to preventing and fighting international crime,” said the INTERPOL Chief.Topics to be discussed during the dialogue meeting include the data processing and sharing frameworks used by each policing organization, their different infrastructures for information exchange, and governance mechanisms. In this respect, the goal is to remove any gaps to improve the global exchange of police information amongst the organizations and INTERPOL.
