Fighting organized crime in LatviaLatvia is located in the Baltic region of Northern Europe where it shares borders with Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania and Russia, as well as a maritime border with Sweden.This geographical location makes the country attractive to regional organized crime groups wishing to carry out smuggling operations between Asia and Europe, particularly in relation to drugs, stolen weapons, people trafficking and excise goods such as alcohol and cigarettes.The international characteristics of these crime areas and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Latvia fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.
