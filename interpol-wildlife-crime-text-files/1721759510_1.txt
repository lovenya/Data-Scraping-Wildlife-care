Tackling German transnational crimeA number of global organized crime groups operate in Germany, engaging in a wide range of crimes such as drug trafficking, property crime, people smuggling and crime associated with the business world, tax and customs offences. Associated crime includes extortion and money laundering.Since a large volume of Germany’s organized crime threats are orchestrated from other countries and regions, a connected, informed and collaborative response is essential to disrupting them.  An international approach is also key to effectively tackling the threat of cybercrime and terrorism in Germany.The INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Germany provides national law enforcement with a platform to work with police across the globe in tackling transnational crime.
