ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES – INTERPOL officially welcomed the Abu Dhabi Police College to its Global Academy network in a signing ceremony on the sidelines of INTERPOL’s 24th Asian Regional Conference, taking place this week in the Emirati capital.The agreement was signed by Colonel Omar Al Ali, Director General of Competency Development at the UAE Ministry of Interior and INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Sock, in the presence of Brigadier Waleed Al-Shamsi, Abu Dhabi Police College Commander.The INTERPOL Global Academy is a network of trusted law enforcement education institutions of national or regional scope that facilitates the development of a global training approach through the exchange of best practices.As a Global Academy member, the Abu Dhabi Police College will develop and deliver programmes that will help upskill police in the Asia region and beyond.“We are keen in the Ministry of Interior to adopt the best international practices and diversify training opportunities, participating in them by presenting our pioneering experiences,” said Colonel Al Ali.“Today we witness the joining of the College to this Global Academy, where expertise and conditional knowledge converge to our collective benefit. This partnership will encourage the development of police work in a professional and institutional manner based on the adoption of the best international technologies and practices,” Colonel Al Ali added.“Transnational crime is evolving fast and it is critical that police officials around the world are equipped to protect their communities against future threats,” said Secretary General Stock.“The Abu Dhabi Police College has a track record of extending their capacity building efforts with great success. I am pleased to welcome them to the INTERPOL Global Academy network and I am confident they will make a meaningful contribution for many officers around the world.”Global Academy members have access to a wide selection of INTERPOL training resources – including digital learning courses – in addition to enriching and adding to existing content.Through their participation in this exclusive network of law enforcement training experts, members also help ensure that INTERPOL’s own training standards incorporate national and regional perspectives, as well as new methodologies and trends.Launched in 2019, the Global Academy has members on every continent, in Argentina, Austria, Botswana, Colombia, Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Spain – and now – in the UAE.Learn more about INTERPOL training and capacity building activities on our website via the links below.
