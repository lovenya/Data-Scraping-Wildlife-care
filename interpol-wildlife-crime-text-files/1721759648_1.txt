As such, it is becoming a targeted transit country for crime groups smuggling illicit merchandise between Asian and European markets.Belarus’s principal transnational crime challenges include trafficking in drugs, people, weapons and works of art as well as illegal migration and international terrorism.The international characteristics of these crime areas and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Belarus fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.
