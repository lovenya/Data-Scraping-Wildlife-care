Sexual abuse and exploitation, trafficking, forced labour and abduction: these are just some of the dangers faced by children around the world today. At INTERPOL, we work to address those crimes that have an international dimension.To help trace missing children, we issue Yellow Notices, while our human trafficking experts work alongside member countries to rescue child victims of trafficking and forced labour.Sexual abuse and exploitationThe global reach and anonymity of the Internet have greatly facilitated the distribution of child sexual abuse material, and access to it. Offenders can now produce, exchange and even direct live video of children â€“ even babies - being abused. They can also come into direct contact with children via social networks and chat functions in games or apps.The priority of our Crimes Against Children unit is to:identify and rescue young victims of sexual abuse;block access to child sexual abuse material;prevent sex offenders from travelling abroad to abuse children or escape justice.
