Comprising an Expo and a Congress, the three-day (14-16 April)  INTERPOL World 2015 aims to create a platform for the security industry, law enforcement and government agencies to develop closer partnerships and innovative security initiatives.Singapore’s Second Minister for Home Affairs, S. Iswaran, opened the Congress by highlighting the role of continuous innovation and close partnerships against crime.“Criminals and terrorists are taking advantage of advancements in technology, globalization and rapid urbanization.  This has ushered in a new wave of threats that can destabilise both global and local security,” said Mr Iswaran.“There is thus an urgent need for law enforcement agencies to leverage latest technologies and adopt innovation as a key enabler of policing work.  Innovation in policing methods and tools is the key to ensuring that law enforcement agencies stay ahead of criminals and ultimately triumph,” added the minister.INTERPOL President Mireille Ballestrazzi said a collective response was necessary to counter terrorism and the illicit activities of increasingly well-structured criminal networks threatening individuals, businesses, administrations, law enforcement and governments.“INTERPOL World provides a unique opportunity to mobilize countries, international and regional organizations, and public and private partners, by sharing expertise and experiences, and thereby identify and develop innovative initiatives against global security challenges,” said President Ballestrazzi.Describing INTERPOL World as a unique forum shaping innovative, multi-stakeholder partnerships between law enforcement and industry, INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock underlined the need for law enforcement to keep pace with technological developments.“Technology will continue to create security challenges going forward, despite making our lives easier, safer, and industries more profitable. At the same time, criminals will continue to find and exploit loopholes for their benefit, and innovate to achieve their goals,” said Secretary General Stock.“INTERPOL World is the extra step that physically brings together in one place the innovation of industry and the experience of law enforcement. By drawing on this synergy, this event will help to identify risks and vulnerabilities in new and emerging technology before they become tangible threats,” added Mr Stock.With INTERPOL World 2015 bringing together more than 8,000 participants, 200 companies from 30 countries and law enforcement from across the globe, its Congress focuses on four emerging security challenges: border management, cybercrime, safe cities and supply chain management.The event is also attended by INTERPOL World strategic partners from the private sector, including: Microsoft, RSA and Symantec on cybersecurity; 3M, Entrust Datacard and Securiport on border management; Motorola Solutions and Thales on safe cities; and DCTA and SICPA on supply chain security.With Singapore marking its 50th anniversary since independence, the inaugural INTERPOL World 2015, which is set to become a biennial event, is being held alongside the opening of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation and the 22nd INTERPOL Asian Regional Conference.
