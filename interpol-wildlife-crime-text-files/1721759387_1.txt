Timeframe: October 2019 to February 2023Donor: Norwegian Ministry of Foreign AffairsThe situationDigital devices form a critical source of information in investigations into all types of crime. Evidence in an electronic format (‘electronic evidence’ or ‘digital evidence’) can be difficult to obtain and understand.Without effective digital forensics capability, law enforcement bodies may fail to obtain crucial evidence, misinterpret its meaning or importance, or even unintentionally destroy it.Project summaryThe objective of Project Leader is to strengthen knowledge and capabilities in digital forensics across four areas: first response, specialist digital forensic analysis, investigations and prosecutions.Sustainability is a key feature of Project Leader. This is achieved through enhanced cooperation with police academies, a train-the-trainer approach, infrastructure development and technical support.It also promotes the use of e-learning, professional policing and gender equality in policing.The project reinforces regional, interregional and international police cooperation by promoting INTERPOL’s policing capabilities and its network of National Central Bureaus.    
    
        
            
Project activitiesDeliver tailored training for:first responders on how to seize and preserve digital evidence;digital forensics laboratories;prosecutors – this session will focus on the fundamental concepts of computing, computer forensics and electronic evidence.Train-the-trainer courses for first responders, digital forensic practitioners and investigators equip participants with the tools to train their colleagues in their home administrations.Set standards and promote cooperation:Workshops on setting national Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for handling and analysing digital evidence.Training on INTERPOL policing capabilities to enhance information sharing. This is vital as electronic evidence often leads to, or can only be accessed through, countries other than the one in which it was seized.Interagency scenario-based exercises.International digital forensics symposiums.Provide tools and equipment:Develop a digital forensics tools catalogue – it is essential that practitioners can access and share information on a wide range of digital forensics tools. An online reference system on digital forensics will ensure a wider reach and sustainability.Provide digital forensics equipment based on need to beneficiary countries.
