We know from experience that partnerships with other organizations in the public and private sectors play an important role in tackling challenges in common areas, in particular transnational crime. By engaging in partnerships across sectors, we can share expertise, technology and resources, and so strengthen our joint response.Our partners are public and private entities who share similar goals to us and make either a monetary or in-kind contribution.  In-kind can be personnel, equipment or software, for example.How can I help?Funding from external organizations supports different types of activities in line with INTERPOL’s five strategic goals, as follows:Serve as the worldwide information hub for law enforcement cooperation;Deliver state-of-the-art policing capabilities that support member countries to fight and prevent transnational crimes;Lead globally innovative approaches to policing;Maximize INTERPOL’s role within the Global Security Architecture;Consolidate resources and governance structures for enhanced operational performance.It goes without saying that a strict due diligence process is followed with relation to external funding.
