Counter-terrorismWe enjoy a strong working relationship with the United Nation’s dedicated counter-terrorism entities including its Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and its Counter-Terrorism Centre, as well as the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and its Executive Directorate (CTED).Key thematic areas for INTERPOL-UN cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts include the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters, the use of biometrics for effective identification of combatants, and the increasing nexus between terrorism and organized crime.In December 2018, INTERPOL became one of three non-UN members of the Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, whose membership consists of 39 UN entities. This Compact is key to global counter-terrorism efforts in terms of strengthening coordination and preventing the duplication of efforts.Organized and emerging crimeINTERPOL increasingly works with United Nations entities to combat organized, emerging and transnational crime with a particular focus on its nexus with terrorism. The SRIUN Vienna Office is particularly involved in these related crime areas, working closely with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.Human trafficking/migrant smugglingINTERPOL is a member of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons (ICAT), a policy forum which promotes a coordinated approach, including victim protection and support.Under the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, we cooperate to combat the smuggling of migrants, ensuring that the victim’s interests are always put first.CybercrimeINTERPOL, in its capacity as a Permanent Observer of the UN, is taking part in the current Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes.The INTERPOL Global Policing Goals and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable DevelopmentINTERPOL – in its capacity as the largest international law enforcement police organization in the world – is uniquely positioned to be the implementing partner of a number of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).INTERPOL’s complementary Global Policing Goals, established in 2018, are therefore aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.This applies especially to Goal 16 (SDG 16) “Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions” which sets targets to reduce all forms of violence, to curtail arms trafficking and to fight organized crime.
