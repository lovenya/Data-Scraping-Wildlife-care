Tackling transnational crime in ArmeniaLandlocked between four other Eurasian countries, Armenia sits strategically at the crossroads of Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. This geographic location is attractive to organized criminal groups wanting to carry out smuggling operations into or across those regions.Armeniaâ€™s crime areas of priority concern include trafficking in drugs, people and fake goods, with these crimes often leading to money laundering and violent crime.            
    
        
            
The international characteristics of these crime areas and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Yerevan fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.INTERPOL in ArmeniaThe NCB for Armenia is part of the national police force. It links national police units to their counterparts worldwide and plays a central role in protecting the country and surrounding region from the expansion of international organized crime.
