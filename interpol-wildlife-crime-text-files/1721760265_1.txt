Our activities addressing environmental crime are all externally funded and dependent on sustainable partnerships.Since 1992, INTERPOL’s work on environmental crimes is supported by INTERPOL’s Environmental Crime Working Party, known as the Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Committee and its four specialized crime working groups on wildlife, forestry, fisheries and pollution crimes. Each one of these working groups is comprised by senior law enforcement experts representing INTERPOL’s member counties.Furthermore, we work in close collaboration with governmental, non-governmental and international organizations to disrupt transnational organized criminal groups involved in environmental crime.We would particularly like to acknowledge the valuable cooperation from our current and past partners, listed below, and encourage other national, regional and international stakeholders to support our vital work to ensure a safer environment.Current and past partnershipsConsortiumGreen Customs InitiativeThe International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC)Countries - SecondmentsBrazil     China    CyprusFranceGermanyIrelandSpainThe NetherlandsUnited Arab EmiratesGovernmental organizations﻿Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)Norwegian Ministry of Climate and EnvironmentThe Norwegian Ministry of Foreign AffairsScottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)﻿United Kingdom Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (UK DEFRA)United States Agency for International Development (USAID)﻿United States Department of State - Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) ﻿United States Forest Service (UFS)Inter-governmental organizations and conventions﻿Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) SecretariatCommission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)European Commission Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO)European Commission Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG HOME)EuropolLusaka Agreement Task Force (LATF)Secretariat of the Basel ConventionUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)World BankWorld Customs Organization (WCO)Non-governmental organizationsCrime Stoppers InternationalDutch Postcode LotteryGlobal Initiative Against Transnational Organized CrimeGRID-ArendalHivosInternational Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)The Pew Charitable TrustsWorld Wildlife Fund (WWF) and various other national, regional and international non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations as well as civil society and the private sector that through their cooperation they provide us with valuable information and support.
