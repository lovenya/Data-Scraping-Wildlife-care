The criminal organization had a specific modus operandi based on well-established roles: two ‘leaders’ benefitting from close connections to professional football, football players who provided confidential information in order to influence matches, procurers responsible for providing identities for online gambling and mules who would place sports bets and collect prize money.Members of the network were careful to use encrypted communications, a mix of in-person and online betting, and placing bets in instalments in order to avoid police detection.INTERPOL’s Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre deployed specialized officers to provide on-the-spot operational and analytical support, cross-check data against INTERPOL’s databases and investigate any international links.INTERPOL’s Match-Fixing Task Force will continue to analyse information and leverage its international network of experts as the investigation progresses.
