Port Security ProjectTimeframe: 2020-2024
Budget: EUR 7.8 million
Donor: European UnionThe situationPort premises serve as critical infrastructure. However, the sheer size and complexity of port facilities, along with the volume of freight handled, can make them difficult to secure.Ports require protection to avoid the damage to the global economy that can result from disruption to supply chains and the flow of trade.In recent years, the East Africa, Southern Africa and Indian Ocean (EA-SA-IO) regions have seen increasing criminal activity in maritime affairs.Despite international and regional efforts to enhance maritime cooperation, countries in these regions still experience cases of piracy and armed robbery, drug trafficking, smuggling of small arms, light weapons and threatened species, human trafficking, illegal fishing, and terrorism against port infrastructure.In addition to the security implications, these illicit activities have a negative impact on the socio-economic and political conditions in the countries of these regions.    
    
        
            
About the ProjectINTERPOL's EU-funded Port Security Project (PSP) is designed to enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies and port authorities to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to threats to port security.The nine participating countries are located in the EA-SA-IO regions: Angola, Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles and Tanzania.The project is coordinated by the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) and implemented jointly with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).Project activitiesThrough this project, INTERPOL provides a set of sustainable tools to all relevant maritime security stakeholders in the region in order to make a long-term difference to port security.It will develop a regional mechanism for information sharing and the exchange of actionable data, and reinforce the response capacity of law enforcement agencies to address existing vulnerabilities and counter persistent and emerging threats.As such, this initiative delivers specialized training modules, regional operational exercises, country-to-country exchange visits, on-site mentoring sessions, and the provision of equipment and access to INTERPOL's databases backed up with robust technical support.The Port Security Project aims to:Enhance know-how of law enforcement techniques regarding harbour security, physical security of port infrastructure, installation surveillance, and checkpoint practices for the detection of narcotics and other illicit goods.Develop deeper understanding of various international methodologies and procedures related to port security.Increase knowledge of safety and security measures for port facilities.Establish a regional network of well-trained port security experts.Extend access to INTERPOL databases, enabling countries in the region to better retrieve and disseminate vital information.Increase the capacity to collect, input, analyse and exchange critical sets of information that will ultimately be recorded in INTERPOL databases and information systems for further exploitation by all our member countries.Project updates2023

Arrest of drug trafficking kingpin Coordinated law enforcement action led to the arrest of the head of a multinational criminal organization, who was wanted internationally. The Nigerian national had fled Brazil following the seizure of 4.9 tons of cocaine worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the port of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in October 2021.Just over a year later, a Red Notice was issued against the suspect following investigations conducted by the Brazilian Federal Police in partnership with INTERPOL (Projects Agwe, Compass and Port Security) and the US Drug Enforcement Agency. The suspect was found to be moving quickly across different countries in the Caribbean.Swift action ensued among law enforcement agencies in multiple countries. Among them, the Immigration Services in Barbados, the INTERPOL Liaison Office for the Caribbean, and INTERPOL National Central Bureaus in Brazil, Barbados, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago and Panama.Less than 48 hours after publication of the Red notice, the individual was located while in transit in Barbados and escorted back to Brazil to face justice.2022

Investigative support and mentoring sessionIn response to specific cases of transnational organized crime across the Western Indian Ocean, a team from two INTERPOL projects (Port Security Project and Project Compass) jointly delivered a mentoring session to officers in the Seychelles. The team provided investigative advice and analytical support in order to identify suspects and uncover further details about the criminal networks involved.This is just one in a series of such mentoring sessions carried out over the past two years in beneficiary countries. As well as helping to move cases forward, the sessions also serve to bolster officers’ knowledge and skills and to embed sustainable practices within national law enforcement agencies.
