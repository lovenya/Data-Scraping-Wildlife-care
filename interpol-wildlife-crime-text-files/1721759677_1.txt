Project I-SOP: INTERPOL Stop Online PiracyTimeframe: 2021 to 2026
Budget: EUR 2.7 million
Donor: Republic of Korea, Ministry of Culture, Sport and TourismThe situationOnline piracy affects many different types of digital content, such as software, music, TV, films and books. The illegal download and distribution of such content causes significant financial losses for the industries concerned, in turn affecting jobs and tax revenue.It exposes consumers to related content that may be inappropriate or harmful, and can also be used to spread malware, Trojans and viruses which present clear security risks.Online piracy is highly profitable to criminals and low risk, due to light penalties. Consumers are often unaware that profits from these crimes are linked to other criminal activities, such as money laundering, terrorist financing and human trafficking.Organized Crime Groups involved in online piracy crimes frequently look like typical commercial companies, and are based on flexible structures, allowing them to adapt quickly to environmental changes.Project summaryINTERPOL launched Project I-SOP in response to the sharp rise in digital piracy crimes prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. Some countries reported an increase of more than 60 per cent in online piracy crimes in the 12 months from April 2020.
