Tackling organized crime in Guatemala            
    
        
            
Guatemala is located between North and South America, has coasts in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, and shares borders with four other Central American countries. This strategic geography makes Guatemala attractive to organized crime groups wanting to link drug producers with drug consumers using land, air and maritime trafficking routes.As a result, some of the crime areas which most affect Guatemala are associated with global drug trafficking, such as extortion, murder, money laundering, and trafficking in firearms, people and counterfeit goods.With regional organized crime networks invariably operating on a global level, the role of INTERPOL’s National Central Bureau (NCB) in Guatemala is crucial to safeguarding national and regional security.INTERPOL in Guatemala
