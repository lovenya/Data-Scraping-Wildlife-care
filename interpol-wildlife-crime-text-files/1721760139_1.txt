“The significant seizures and information exchange across countries achieved during Operation Blizzard underline how coordinated global initiatives can maximize impact,” said Daoming Zhang, INTERPOL’s Assistant Director in charge of Environmental Security.“The illegal trade in reptiles has close associations with organized crime – Operation Blizzard sends a clear message to criminals that the global law enforcement community is homing in on them,” added Mr Zhang.An intelligence-driven operationIntelligence was gathered and shared ahead of the operation via INTERPOL National Central Bureaus and Europol, to identify criminal networks involved in the illegal reptile trade. This information was used to shape operational activity and track suspected offenders and their associates.Europol’s Head of the Economic and Property Crime Unit, Pedro Felício said: “Globally coordinated police operations like operation Blizzard are now at the forefront of environmental preservation. Nevertheless, despite the various efforts made, the threat of environmental crime remains high.”Aircraft passengers, commercial cargo, pet shops, and legally permitted reptile holders were also targeted with searches and inspections carried out by officers, to detect alleged offending and to help build information sources.“Operation Blizzard clearly demonstrates that by pooling our enforcement and intelligence resources, the enforcement community firmly contributes to disrupting this destructive trade in reptiles. This operation is testimony to what can be achieved if we all work together,” said Dylan Swain, Principal Compliance Officer with New Zealand’s Department of Conservation.Results will continue to be analysed globally to generate further intelligence which will be used as guidance in future national, regional and international law enforcement efforts.
