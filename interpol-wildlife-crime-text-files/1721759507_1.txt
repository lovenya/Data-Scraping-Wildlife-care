Tackling Mediterranean organized crimeMalta is a small archipelago island country in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, located at the crossroads of trade routes linking Europe, Asia and African markets. This geography makes Malta attractive to global organized crime groups.The most widespread crimes to affect the region are human trafficking, people smuggling and drug crime. A number of global organized crime groups operate these trafficking rings through Malta, engaging also in money laundering and fraud.Given that these organized crimes are orchestrated from other countries and regions, the role of INTERPOL’s National Central Bureau (NCB) in Malta is crucial to safeguarding national and regional security.INTERPOL in MaltaMalta is constantly upgrading its police action to be able to address emerging crime effectively. Located in the town of Floriana, Malta’s NCB is part of the national police International Relations Unit. It is the country’s unique cooperation platform linking national law enforcement with the INTERPOL community.The NCB is headed by a Police Inspector with command of four police officers who manage international police cooperation matters linked to Malta. Given the high number of globalized crime groups operating through Malta, a significant amount of communications sent and received through the NCB deals with money laundering and fraud.The NCB enables police officers across Malta to detect, investigate and prevent the flow of illicit goods along trafficking routes in and around the country and along its waterways. It takes part regularly in global INTERPOL-led police operations which focus on regional organized crime.Law enforcement in MaltaLaw enforcement services in Malta are provided by the Malta Police Force (MPF). Established in 1814, it is one of the oldest police forces in Europe.The force is in charge of national security, crime prevention and crime investigation on the main island of Malta and its neighbouring islands Gozo and Comino.With a strength of more than 2,000 men and women, MPF is headed by a Commissioner of Police and operates under the command of the Ministry for Home Affairs and National Security.
