Fighting organized crime in KuwaitThe strategic location of Kuwait at the crossroads of Asia, the Middle East, and Europe makes the country attractive to organized crime groups wishing to carry out smuggling operations into the region, or to cross it on their way to other continents. As a result, its priority crime areas of concern include trafficking in drugs, firearms, people and fake goods, as well as cybercrime.The international characteristics of these crime types and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Kuwait fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.
