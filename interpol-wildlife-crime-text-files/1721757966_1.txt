Basic cyber hygiene advice will be provided throughout the campaign, to ensure that individuals and businesses are equipped with the knowledge of how to protect their systems and data.Joining the campaign are authorities in more than 70 member countries. A number of private-sector partners, international organizations such as UNODC and World Economic Forum, and non-profits are also supporting the campaign by sharing information on recent cases, as well as on tools available to help members of public protect their systems from this threat.Craig Jones, INTERPOL’s Director of Cybercrime, said: “We click, tap or swipe hundreds of times a day, often automatically. This campaign seeks to remind the public that we should pay attention to all our actions online, even just one click. Remaining vigilant is the best way to prevent cybercrime and keep our cyberspace safe.We are grateful for the support and interest of our member countries, partners as well as the general public in this endeavour to reduce the impact of cybercrime.”The campaign is supported by the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC) funded by the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).
