At the invitation of Prince Albert I of Monaco, lawyers and police officials from 24 countries discussed cooperation on solving crimes, identification techniques and extradition.The meeting was highly successful, but plans had to be put on hold due to the outbreak of the First World War.1923 – the foundations are laidThe idea of an international police body was revived by Dr Johannes Schober, President of the Vienna Police. He convened the second International Criminal Police Congress in Vienna, Austria in 1923. It was attended by representatives from 20 countries.
