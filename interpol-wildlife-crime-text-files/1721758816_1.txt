Operations like this show what can be achieved when law enforcement agencies collaborate in the fight against organized crime,” said the Head of INTERPOL Brasilia, Commissioner Valdecy Urquiza Junior.“This operation has resulted in a valuable exchange of experience and knowledge and will provide a strong platform for even closer cooperation to target organized crime networks in the future,” said Luis Arias Navarro, Head of INTERPOL Asuncion.“Operations such as this are not just about arrests and seizures, they are also about the added value that INTERPOL brings to its member countries to strengthen national and regional law enforcement cooperation,” said Tim Morris, INTERPOL’s Executive Director for Police Services.“When frontline officers have access to INTERPOL’s global network and databases, they can join the dots between investigations around the world which would otherwise go unnoticed, and we will continue to work with our member countries to encourage this model worldwide,” added Mr Morris.In addition to the INTERPOL National Central Bureaus (NCBs) in Asuncion, Brasilia and Buenos Aires, the operation was supported by the Federal Police, National Gendarmerie, Airport Police and Navy Prefecture in Argentina, the Federal Police, Highway Police and Federal Revenue Service in Brazil, and the Paraguay National Police.
