DOHA, Qatar â€“ INTERPOL's 79th General Assembly opened with ministers from around the world endorsing the organization's pivotal role at the centre of global law enforcement, and calling for countries to maintain close links with INTERPOL and use its services to form a strong, global network to counter international crime and terrorism.The ministerial discussion on 'Challenges to Fighting Crime in the 21st Century' launched the four-day conference (8-11 November) in Doha which brings together some 650 police chiefs and senior law enforcement officials from 141 countries.Opening the conference, Qatar's Minister of State for Internal Affairs, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, said that the General Assembly would provide delegates with an opportunity to develop a communal response to global challenges and underlined Qatar's commitment to enhancing both national and international security."The key to success in fighting crime lies in closer co-ordination, in sharing information and good practice between experts from different countries and backgrounds," said the Minister who announced a pledge of USD 2 million for the proposed INTERPOL Global Complex in Singapore."Qatar strongly supports the activities and efforts of INTERPOL which has demonstrated an extraordinary energy in bringing together law enforcement from across the world to combat all types of crime and we are pleased to make this contribution towards the INTERPOL Global Complex."INTERPOL President Khoo Boon Hui said the conference would help law enforcement across the globe identify ways to combat the 'increasingly sophisticated crime challenges of the 21st century', bringing to new levels the importance of international co-operation to effectively fight transnational crime."Traditional crime fighting techniques and the way we exchange and share police information is proving to be inadequate. Continuous innovation and adaptability to the operating environment are key to an effective policing strategy," said President Khoo.The President also emphasized the important contribution of the ministerial discussion towards identifying new strategies and perspectives in adapting a more holistic approach to combating transnational crime and terrorism.With interventions from Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pakistan, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sudan, the Vatican City and Vietnam addressing a range of issues relating to international security, a joint statement was endorsed by all of the 18 ministers in attendance and will provide a basis for future policing initiatives.
