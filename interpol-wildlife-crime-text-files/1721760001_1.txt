The most cost-effective way to move goods and raw materials in bulk around the world is across oceans and coastal waters. More than 90 per cent of the world’s goods are transported by sea.Maritime crimes affect the freedom of navigation and world trade and pose a threat to international security and individual safety.
 
At INTERPOL, we work with local, regional and international stakeholders to reduce maritime crime globally and improve maritime governance. Our three main areas of action are facilitating the exchange of information, strengthening first responder and law enforcement capabilities, and building international and cross-sector coalitions.
