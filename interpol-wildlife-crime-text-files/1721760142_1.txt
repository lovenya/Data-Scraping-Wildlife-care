They committed to “significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows and combat all forms of organized crime” by 2030.Project aimsThe overall objective of Project DISRUPT is to fight illicit firearms trafficking by linking law enforcement efforts with broader criminal justice responses in Central and South America as well as in West and Central Africa.INTERPOL and UNDOC will work together to help beneficiary countries develop their capacity, promote adequate security and highlight the key dangers associated with firearms trafficking.Project DISRUPT will:Strengthen member countries’ capacity to detect and prosecute arms trafficking offences through intelligence-led law enforcement operations;Identify trends, routes and patterns in firearms trafficking;Increase understanding of the nature and extent of illicit trafficking in firearms;Collect and analyse firearms data, at national and international levels;Provide an adequate legal framework on both firearms control and criminal justice enforcement measures and mechanisms.Project activitiesINTERPOL will establish firearm focal points and set up a workflow between police, the gendarmerie, customs, military and judicial services of beneficiary countries to provide training courses, which  focus on:Methods and techniques specific to firearms trafficking investigations;INTERPOL tools and policing capabilities;Firearms identification and the use of INTERPOL’s Firearms Reference Table;INTERPOL Firearms Protocol and best practices of firearms investigations;Developing records keeping of illicit firearms;Querying and Tracing intelligence on recovered firearms through iARMS;Responding to international trace requests;Detection, trends, and emerging threats.At the same time, UNODC will work closely with law enforcement and the criminal justice system to support investigations to counter firearms trafficking cases and related crimes.Project UpdatesOperation Trigger IX – Latin America12 March - 2 April 2023In the biggest firearms operation ever coordinated by INTERPOL, authorities from 15 countries across Central and South America made 14,260 arrests and seized some 8,200 illicit firearms, as well as 300,000 rounds of ammunition.
