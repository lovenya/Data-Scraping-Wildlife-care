Fighting organized crime in BelgiumBelgium is a small landlocked country in the heart of Europe bordered by four other European countries and a North Sea coast. Its capital is one of the three official European Union capitals. These geopolitical characteristics, along with a globalized and stable economy make Belgium potentially attractive to international organized crime.The organized crime groups which operate in Belgium engage principally in drug crime, motor vehicle trafficking and fraud. Associated crimes that also affect Belgium are violence and firearms trafficking.The international characteristics of these crimes and their links with organized crime groups around the world make the role of the Belgian INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) fundamental to maintaining national security.INTERPOL in BelgiumThe INTERPOL NCB in Brussels is part of the International Police Cooperation unit in theÂ  Federal Police.By providing the globally sourced intelligence they need around the clock, the Belgian NCB enables police officers nationwide to detect, investigate and prevent the flow of illicit goods along trafficking routes in and around the country.The NCB plays a strong national role in tackling the serious crime areas which affect the country most, as well as crimes against children, fugitive investigations, financial crime and trafficking in human beings. It is a regular partner in INTERPOL-led global police operations in these crime areas.Law enforcement in BelgiumLaw enforcement services in Belgium are provided by an integrated Police service structured on two levels: federal and local. Both forces are autonomous but complementary.The federal Police carries out expert police operations at national and regional level whilst also supporting local and federal units. The local Police is made up of 185 local police forces each operating in their own district, called Police zones. Together, local and federal police provide the integrated police service.
