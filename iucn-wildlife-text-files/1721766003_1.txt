The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act to provide effective and expeditious adjudication of environmental disputes involving multidisciplinary issues. With one principle, and four zonal benches, the NGT is a specialized body consisting of a Judicial Member who is either a sitting or former Judges of the High Court, and an Expert Member specialized in the specific environmental fields. The court is obligated to apply the principle of sustainable development, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle when passing any order, decision, or award.
