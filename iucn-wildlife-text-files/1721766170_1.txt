The meeting was organized by the project consortium of HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation (HELVETAS), IUCN, Network Activities Group (NAG), and IUCN member Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (BANCA).

This consultation, which followed the first one held in May 2016, had three objectives (1) validation of the values and threats to the gulf; (2) identification of the short and long-term management objectives for the gulf; and (3) discussion of the institutional arrangements for managing the gulf.

Jake Brunner, Head of IUCN's Indo-Burma Group, said that the effective management of the gulf was like a three-legged stool, requiring a management plan, a management committee, and an international label such as Ramsar. All three pillars are needed to provide stability.

The workshop brought together 45 representatives from the Mon State and Bago Region governments, the Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division (NWCD) of MONREC, Mawlamyine University, Myanmar Fisheries Federation, local communities, and local and international NGOs.Â
