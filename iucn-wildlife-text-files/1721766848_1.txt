The three-year partnership also aims to protect limestone hills in the company’s quarrying sites, as well as surrounding areas in Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam, and contribute to sector-wide improvements in the extractives and relevant sectors in the region.

Siam City Cement Public Company Limited (SCCC) is the first company in Thailand’s cement industry to have signed an MOU with IUCN. The MOU was signed by Mr. Paul Heinz Hugentobler, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siam City Cement Public Company Limited and Ms. Aban Marker Kabraji, Regional Director for IUCN Asia and Director of the IUCN Regional Hub for Asia-Oceania. A ceremony to celebrate the partnership was held on November 27, 2018 at Siam City Cement Headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, where Ms Kabraji was represented by Dr Tejpal Singh, Deputy Regional Director for IUCN Asia.

Mr Paul Heinz Hugentobler said that biodiversity conservation is high on SCCC Group’s agenda. The Group company is committed to enhancing biodiversity management of quarry sites by turning them into forests through the company’s quarry rehabilitation programmes.

From 2012 to 2013, SCCC commissioned a team of ecologists from Kasetsart University to conduct a biodiversity study in SCCC’s quarry sites in Kang Koi district, Saraburi. The results have been used to inform SCCC’s long-term strategy to rehabilitate the district’s ecosystems.

“Siam City Cement Vietnam or INSEE Vietnam and a joint venture in Cambodia called Chip Mong INSEE Cement Corporation are also committed to implementing biodiversity-related activities to protect the Mekong Delta Limestones in Viet Nam and Cambodia respectively,” said Mr Hugentobler.

He added that “Siam City Cement Lanka or INSEE Lanka already has a three-year partnership agreement with IUCN Sri Lanka to rescue and release threatened wildlife, to develop mine restoration guidelines, and to carry out annual ecological monitoring of restored mines at INSEE’s quarry sites in Aruwakkalu and Puttalam in Sri Lanka."

“As a resource-intensive industry, the extractive sectors are a priority for business engagement,” said Ms Kabraji. “Engaging with companies like SCCC is central to IUCN’s work to promote a green economy and sustainable development. The IUCN and SCCC partnership aims to have a broader impact on the extractives sector by sharing best practices and lessons learned with other companies and conservation communities in the region.”

IUCN Asia has a proven track record of working with businesses in the mining and extractives sector. In India, IUCN has worked with Tata Steel and the Aditya Birla Group to develop biodiversity management policies and implement biodiversity management plans in several mining sites across India.
