Wetlands include swamps, marshes, fens, bogs, lakes, rivers, floodplains, estuaries, mangroves, mudflats, coral reefs and lagoons. If you know a wetland, then you can help.

The World Wetland Network (www.worldwetnet.org), the Ramsar Section of the Society of Wetland Scientists (www.sws.org), the Cobra Collective (www.cobracollective.org) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (www.iucn.org) have come together to gather and evaluate information from across the world and to lead a global assessment based on ‘citizen-science’ on the state of wetlands. This is a repeat of the 2017 survey which is reported on in the Wetlands journal here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13157-020-01267-8

If you contributed to the 2017 survey thank you very much indeed – your information has been invaluable. We’d really like you to also contribute to this new survey so that we can assess any recent changes to the same wetland(s) about which you previously reported.

All you need to do is follow this link --> https://worldwetland.network/survey and fill in the information about the wetland you know. The survey is available in seven languages (English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese) and will take you a maximum of 15 minutes to complete. It will really help understanding of how the world’s wetlands are doing.

Please support this initiative, forward the survey link to your networks and of course don’t forget to fill in the survey yourself.
