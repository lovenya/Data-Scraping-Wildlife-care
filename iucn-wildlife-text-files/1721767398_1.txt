Please check out the new SULi website. This is work in progress but we hope members find this useful - both internally and for an external audience. We hope to keep the front news section as dynamic as possible and are happy to share posts from SULi members whenever we can.

With many thanks to SSC for the small grants fund they have established that provided the necessary support for the website!

SULi members produced a new flyer on sustainable use which was distributed at the SSC Leaders meeting in October.

SULi is a global volunteer network formed by the International Union of Conservation of Nature in 2012, as a joint initiative of the Species Survival Commission (SSC) and the Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP). It aims to mobilise global expertise across the science, policy and practice sectors to address the urgent challenges of overexploitation of wild species and support robust, equitable models of sustainable use that meet human needs and priorities.

Since its establishment SULi has established itself as a credible, influential voice in some of the most controversial and high profile issues facing the global conservation community, including on illegal wildlife trade, hunting and  other forms of consumptive wildlife use. We have successfully built partnerships, marshaled knowledge, and influenced high level deliberations and policy.
