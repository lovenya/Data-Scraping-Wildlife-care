India brings to APAP a rich protected area heritage and many decades of conservation experience. Since the establishment of its first formal national park in 1936, India has acquired expertise in many different facets of protected area management, including the mitigation of human-wildlife conflict, visitor management, law enforcement, and threatened species recovery.

Drawing on India’s unique experience and MoEFCC’s leadership, APAP is well-positioned to continue its growth and development, and to assist member countries to meet the new protected area targets that will be contained in the new Global Biodiversity Framework. As India takes on the role of APAP Co-chair, IUCN would also like to acknowledge the many contributions of the two previous Co-chairs, the Ministry of the Environment Japan and the Ministry of Environment Korea.

MoEFCC’s new role as the APAP Co-Chair has already generated considerable interest and received extensive media attention within India, including the following:
