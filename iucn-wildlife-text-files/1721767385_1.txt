The technical sessions of the workshop deliberated on IUCN initiatives in Indian Himalayan Region, pesenting details of the project work in various sectos supporting climate change adaptation in Himachal Pradesh followed by a panel discussion on strengthening actions for tackling climate change challenges through policy inititiaves which take into consideration the mountain ecosystem perspective.

The need for synergy on collective actions for implementation, and linking indigenous practices & traditional knowledge with modern science on managing natural resources were some key recomendations.
