India's progress in tiger conservation notably marked by the anniversary of Project Tiger stands as a significant milestone in ecological preservation. After plummeting to 1,411 tigers in 2006 the population has surged impressively to 3,167 by 2022. This remarkable recovery is attributed to the expansion of reserves from 9 in 1973 to 54 in 2023 showcasing collaborative efforts and unwavering commitment from various stakeholders. However while this surge in tiger numbers signifies a triumph for conservationists it has also brought about profound effects on tribal communities residing within and, around these reserves.
