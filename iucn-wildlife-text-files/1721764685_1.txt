Conservation and Human Rights: Key Issues and Contexts – a scoping paper for the CIHR – provides an introduction to international rights frameworks, identifies key issues at the intersection of conservation and human rights, and explores practical approaches to address these issues in conservation contexts.
Rights-based Approaches to REDD+ is the report of a CIHR workshop held in January 2012 in Lima, Peru to share experience on practical efforts to implement indigenous peoples' rights and social safeguards and generate community benefits from REDD+, consonant with internationally-recognized human rights.
