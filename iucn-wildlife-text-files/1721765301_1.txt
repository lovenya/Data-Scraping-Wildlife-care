IUCNâ€™s dryland programme based at the IUCN Eastern and Southern  Africa Regional Office (ESARO) has been working in Garba Tula District,  of Isiolo County since 2009 implementing the Improving Governance of  Natural Resources for Rural Poverty Reduction project with funding from  the Department for International Development Governance and Transparency  Fund, (DFID-GTF), and complementary resources from Catholic Aid for  Relief and Development (CORDAID). This project seeks to strengthen  natural resource governance in Garba Tula, by supporting the underlying  institutions and regulatory systems, enabling more participatory  decision-making practices and positioning communities to benefit from  more sustainable resource management. The project has 4 key result  areas:
Decision makers and stakeholders have increased  awareness and policy guidance for dryland management based on identified  best practices.
    More effective participatory  decision-making in natural resource use and management, based on  strengthened institutional arrangements
    Local communities  are better able to capture viable economic and biodiversity-related  benefits from identified dryland ecosystem opportunities
    Lessons  and best practices are effectively captured and disseminated to promote  learning and enable scaling up of project impacts
These  handbooks are the products of this project and are a means to share the  learning from the approaches used with a wider audience of practitioners  and policy makers. There are 3 handbooks in this series: 1)  Strengthening Natural Resource Governance, 2) Participatory Rangeland  Planning - A Practitioners Guide and 3) Enabling Community Benefits from  Sustainably Managed Drylands.
