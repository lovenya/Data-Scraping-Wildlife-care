Selected from a pool of over 3,500 entrepreneurs from around the world, speakers presented solutions to sustainable development challenges. Each speaker gave a pitch, followed by questions from a panel and the audience, comprising global leaders from the private sector, government and civil society.

The projects featured include creating cost-effective, sustainable animal protein and organic fertiliser in Ghana, recycling glass into sand for coastal restoration in the US, supporting rural families and businesses to access affordable, safe and sustainable energy in Argentina, and leveraging bioacoustics for biodiversity assessments. Speakers highlighted the importance of including gender equality, and the value of circular economy approaches.

“I want to speak about value-based partnership, and that value is compassion,” said Sheherazade, Co-Executive Director of PROGRES (Sulawesi Regional Ecological Conservation Initiative), whose organisation weaves together people-oriented and scientific-based approaches to create just, collective, and impactful conservation strategies in the biodiversity hotspot of Wallacea. Sheherezade talked about the importance of shared values when working with communities who contribute to protecting their local wildlife.

The projects are relevant to numerous Sustainable Development Goals, such as Zero Hunger, Affordable and Clean Energy, Gender Equality, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Reduced Inequalities, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action, Life Below Water, Life on Land and Partnerships for the Goals.
