In this issue, we are taking the opportunity to remind you that there are a few more days left to apply for a grant under our Action for Buna call in Albania!

Since the last issue, we have gathered in Rotterdam, for the IUCN Regional Conservation Forum to mobilise the Union and start preparing for the IUCN Congress 2020. We saw the update of The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, that clearly shows how much humans around the world are overexploiting wildlife.

On a brighter note, we are celebrating the extension of the Ohrid Region World Heritage site in Albania, and the protected status given to Ulcinj Salina in Montenegro. Read about the linkages we are making between earth observation and environmental law enforcement, and the advances related to embedding nexus perspectives in Central Asia... and much more!

We thank all the contributors to A Voice for Nature #17 and wish you enjoyable reading.
