Human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) have become a frequent and serious concern worldwide, and often notoriously challenging to resolve, presenting parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) with real struggles to make progress in protecting both the wildlife and communities affected by this issue.

The IUCN SSC Human-Wildlife Conflict & Coexistence Specialist Group recently published the first comprehensive global Guidelines on the management of HWC, which provide foundations and principles for good practice, with clear, practical and policy-oriented guidance on how best to tackle conflicts and enable coexistence with wildlife. These have been developed for use by conservation practitioners, community leaders, decision makers, researchers, government officers and others.

This session will provide a briefing about the Guidelines, which are currently being translated into all UN languages, and additional resources available that may help parties manage their specific HWC contexts. The session will include:

An overview of the key concepts, structure and selected chapters
A discussion with participants on country-specific needs and the implementation of the Guidelines
Launch new Russian edition of the Guidelines
