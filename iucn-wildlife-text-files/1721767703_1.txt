In Tanzania, more than 1’350 environmentally-friendly beehives containing more than 50 million bees have been hung from trees in an effort that directly protects lions, leopards and cheetahs, all classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This project is part of IUCN Save Our Species’ African Wildlife initiative, co-funded by the European Union. 

Under Tanzanian law, trees holding beehives cannot be cut down. By placing beehives in strategic locations, the project ensures the conservation of the enormous landscape these big cats rely on to survive.

Win-win model for wildlife and local communities

More than 1’260 bee-keeping women participate in the project, which also allows them to learn entrepreneurial skills and gain financial independence by selling the honey harvested from the beehives. 

The Women’s Beekeeping Initiative from African People & Wildlife represents a win-win model and approach to conservation that should benefit wildlife and local communities for years to come!
