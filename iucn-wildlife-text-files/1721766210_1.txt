Created in 1948, IUCN is a membership Union composed of both government and civil society organisations. As the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network, it harnesses the knowledge and expertise of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts to provide data, assessments and analysis of environmental and development challenges. In 2018, IUCN will celebrate its 70th anniversary.

“We have a treasure trove of titles that are often requested by researchers from around the world, who are eager to understand IUCN’s role in defining the conservation and sustainable development agenda,” says Daisy Larios, IUCN Library and Publications Manager. “Many of these titles may be difficult to find online or in local libraries, and having them digitised makes it possible for more people to access our collection.”

The selected titles go back to 1961, and include annual reports, documentation from the 2000 IUCN World Conservation Congress in Amman, Jordan and reports from IUCN’s Commissions and Secretariat.

For access to all of IUCN’s digitised publications, as well as the complete catalogue of IUCN’s publications and other holdings of the IUCN HQ Library, visit https://portals.iucn.org/library.

Researchers hoping to access portions of the collection which have not been digitised should make an appointment with the IUCN Library and Publications Manager to visit IUCN Headquarters in Gland, Switzerland.
