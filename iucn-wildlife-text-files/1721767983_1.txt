This May, promote and explore the biodiversity of parks and protected areas by taking part in the BackyardBio campaign.

Built around the International Day of Biodiversity on May 22, the event invites people to get outside and explore nature.

Participants are being asked to take photos to document the diversity of local wildlife, which they can share on social media with #backyardbio and on INaturalist at www.INaturalist.org/projects/backyardbio.

Share your photos and stories, and encourage others to do the same to highlight the biodiversity in your park or protected area. Find out more at backyardbio.net.
