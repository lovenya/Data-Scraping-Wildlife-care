The project will implement two new techniques aimed at better protecting sea turtles: Conservation Dogs and Night-Vision Drone. Both activities are designed to provide technical, logistical, and strategical support to the “Sea Turtle Surveillance Task Force” (STSTF) initiative, initiated by the Cape Verdean Ministry for Agriculture and Environment. The priority will be to improve patrol operations teams by the acquisition of field equipment and devices and training.
