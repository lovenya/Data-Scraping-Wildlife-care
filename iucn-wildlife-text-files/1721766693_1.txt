The 16th IUCN Academy of Environmental Law Colloquium, held from 4-6 July 2018, brought together over 300 participants from six continents to discuss current international, comparative, national, and local environmental law issues.  The theme of the Colloquium was “The Transformation of Environmental Law and Governance:  Risk, Resilience and Innovation.”  Hosted at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, the three-day event featured over sixty parallel sessions, five plenary sessions, and twenty poster presentations.  In addition, in the days preceding the Colloquium, the Academy Board of Governors held a two-day meeting, and the Academy research committee and teaching committees held popular day-long workshops.

The World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL) had over sixty Members present at the Colloquium, many of whom presented their research during the parallel sessions.  This high level of participation by WCEL at the Colloquium reflects the strong historical partnership between the Academy and WCEL.  As sister organizations, they have interlocking boards, and many of WCEL’s individual Members belong to the 200 academic institutions that constitute the membership of the Academy. In this brief video, Professor Nick Robinson explains the history of the relationship between the two organizations.

Closing Plenary, Proceedings Publication, and the 17th Colloquium in Malaysia

During the closing plenary remarks on behalf of WCEL, Denise Antolini emphasized the importance of the partnership between WCEL and the Academy noting the extensive participation of WCEL Members at the Colloquium.  Both Antolini and Elizabeth Kirk thanked Francesco Sindico and Stephanie Switzer of the Strathclyde Center for Environmental Law and Governance (ELGA) for their highly successful organization of the Colloquium and all the various pre-Colloquium events as well as several elegant and fun social gatherings.  During his closing remarks, Sindico announced the Academy’s intention to publish the Colloquium proceedings with Edward Elgar.
