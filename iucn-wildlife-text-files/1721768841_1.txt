Delivering her remarks, Minister Mujawamariya reminded that “Climate change and biodiversity issues are intertwined and addressing them is possible if governments, private sector, development partners and the community at large, work together.”

She explained that Rwanda opted for a green growth approach to development by integrating environment and climate change, and nature conservation into its development agenda.

Using examples of what Rwanda has done so far, Minister Mujawamariya noted that Rwanda ratified and domesticated various Multilateral Environmental Agreements including, among others the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, The Convention on Biological diversity (and its Nagoya and Cartagena protocols) and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

The Annual meeting which brought together various IUCN partners was also graced by various high level officials including Dr. Bruno Oberle, Director General of IUCN; Luther Anukur, IUCN Regional Director, East and Southern Africa; Nana Oumou Toure, IUCN Regional Director, West and Central Africa; Kaori Yasuda, IUCN Rwanda Country Representative, Government officials and development partners among others.

RWCA is spearheading a conservation initiative aimed at protecting the Grey Crowned Crane and other endangered wildlife in Rwanda. Through this initiative, the organization is working towards the restoration and protection of their natural habitats, which are essential for their survival.

Grey Crowned Cranes are a symbol of wealth and longevity in Rwandan culture, and face increasing threats due to habitat reduction and illegal trade. Rwanda is a small country with an incredible variety of bio-diversity, yet it is challenged by high population density and extreme poverty. This results in resources and land being overstretched and high competition between people and wildlife.

Additionally, Grey Crowned Cranes have been kept in captivity by hotels and by wealthy families who are unaware of the environmental consequences of doing so. These captive cranes are usually stressed, malnourished, have their wings broken to prevent them flying, don’t breed and die prematurely.

In addition, there has been a general lack of awareness in Rwanda about the endangered status of cranes and the law protecting them.

RWCA is spearheading a conservation initiative aimed at protecting the Grey Crowned Crane and other endangered wildlife in Rwanda. Through this initiative, the organization is working towards the restoration and protection of their natural habitats, which are essential for their survival.

Grey Crowned Cranes are a symbol of wealth and longevity in Rwandan culture, and face increasing threats due to habitat reduction and illegal trade. Rwanda is a small country with an incredible variety of bio-diversity, yet it is challenged by high population density and extreme poverty. This results in resources and land being overstretched and high competition between people and wildlife.

Additionally, Grey Crowned Cranes have been kept in captivity by hotels and by wealthy families who are unaware of the environmental consequences of doing so. These captive cranes are usually stressed, malnourished, have their wings broken to prevent them flying, don’t breed and die prematurely.

In addition, there has been a general lack of awareness in Rwanda about the endangered status of cranes and the law protecting them.
