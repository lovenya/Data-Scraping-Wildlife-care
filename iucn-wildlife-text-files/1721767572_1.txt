The 3rd of March was chosen as it was on this day in 1967 that the National Park System was officially recognised in ROK. Jirisan National Park was designated as ROK’s first national park that same year. Since then, 22 National Parks have been established, covering a total area of 3,972km2, or 4% of the country. Importantly, these parks are home to more than 22,000 species of wildlife and are visited by more than 45 million people every year.

National Park Day will be an opportunity to highlight the role of national parks in supporting human wellbeing and conserving nature. Park visitors and volunteers, and local communities, will celebrate National Park Day each year as they share in the vision for a better future where people and nature coexist in harmony.
