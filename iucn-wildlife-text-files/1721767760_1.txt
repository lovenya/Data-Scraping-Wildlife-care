This year, the prestigious Tusk Conservation Awards will take place virtually on Thursday 3 December at 18:00 GMT . Launched with Prince William in 2013, the Awards celebrate the work of leading conservationists in Africa.

Tusk recently announced a significant increase in the value of the awards thanks to the generous commitment of £1m over 5 years from The Nick Maughan Foundation. Recognised at the virtual ceremony, this funding will more than double the conservation grants given to the winners and finalists dedicated to safeguarding the continent’s wildlife and habitat.

Announcing the shortlist for the 2020 Tusk Award for Conservation in Africa, Charlie Mayhew, CEO of Tusk said, “We are immensely grateful to Ninety One for their continued partnership and thrilled to announce the invaluable additional support from The Nick Maughan Foundation. As the future of the natural world is brought into even sharper focus, it is fantastic that the recipients of our awards can continue their vital work thanks to this much needed boost to grant funding. I am very pleased today to reveal the three exceptional finalists for this year’s Tusk Award.”
