The goal of the SADC TFCA FF programme is to use the facility as a new regional financing mechanism to contribute to the sustainable protection of biodiversity and promote trans-frontier conservation areas in the SADC region.

The development and establishment of a regional and sustainable Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA) financing mechanism is a major component of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) TFCA programme (2013). The initial funding by the German Government (BMZ through KfW) shall be EUR 12 million (plus an additional commitment for EUR 11 million to be made available in the near future) for an initial financing cycle of up to 6 years. The intention is to leverage additional funds from various partners, including further commitment from Germany, in order to reach an operational funding volume of approximately EUR 100 million in the medium to long term.

The SADC TFCA Financing Facility (FF) is intended to foster closer collaboration between stakeholders supporting TFCAs and provide the basis for longer-term and more sustainable funding opportunities to develop all TFCAs. The SADC TFCA FF will be fully aligned with the objectives of the SADC Programme for TFCAs (2013) aiming at contributions to various objectives and goals in other relevant SADC strategies and protocols.

Through the TFCA Financing Facility, investments in tangible measures strengthening ecological, economic, cultural and institutional connectivity within SADC TFCAs will be leveraged in a flexible, demand-and performance driven way. The measures shall integrate three dimensions: 


	Improved habitat connectivity, especially for elephants and large carnivores as flagship species (“species” dimension),
	Improved management effectiveness and governance of TFCAs and Protected Areas PAs (“habitat” dimension) and
	Improved livelihoods for communities affected by human-wildlife co-habitation (“people” dimension)


The SADC TFCA FF will contribute towards:


	Faster implementation of projects
	Better dissemination and multiplication of innovative approaches
	A pipeline of bankable projects, ready for funding and able to absorb additional funds
	Faster response and reaction to upcoming challenges, crises or opportunities
