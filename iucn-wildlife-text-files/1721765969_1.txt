In this context, the IUCN Sri Lanka Country Office collaborated with Sabaragamuwa Province Central Environment Authority (CEA) office to conduct a training programmme for school teachers on Highland Ecosystems with Special Emphasis on Peak Wilderness Nature Reserve. This event was held on 10 March 2017 at the Samudhi Reception Hall in Rathnapura.

One hundred and twenty one (121) school teachers from 120 schools and six CEA officers attended the programme.  The teachers who participated were in-charge of the CEA-led School Environment Leader Programme in their schools.

Participants gained thorough knowledge of biodiversity conservation, highland ecosystems of Sri Lanka and Paleobiodiversity of the Ratnapura district.  Lectures were conducted by Prof. Devaka Weerakoon of  University of Colombo, Dr Sandun Perera of Sabaragamuwa University and Mr Sampath Goonatilake of IUCN Sri Lanka Country Office.                    

The seminar was a part of the HSBC Bank sponsored project on "Enhancing Educational and Awareness Programmes on the Central Highlands, A UNESCO World Heritage Serial Property in Sri Lanka".  The Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Forest Department are the two main counterpart government agencies of this project.

This experience prompted IUCN to develop more programmes to take the youth to nature. Sri Lanka youth today have limited opportunities to feel the nature, first hand and also talk to the experts in the field to understand the ecosystem and life linkages.
