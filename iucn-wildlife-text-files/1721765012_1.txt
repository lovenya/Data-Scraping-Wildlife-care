The United for Wildlife collaboration, under the Presidency of The Duke, has an extensive international field presence and a large network of collaborating institutions. It hopes to use this powerful global alliance to address both the supply and demand issues of illegal wildlife trafficking and also to support the sustainable development of affected communities and bring those involved in the illegal trade to justice.
“It is clearly evident from the impressive gathering of people present at this symposium, that there is a strong commitment and an unyielding determination to fight the escalating battle against illegal wildlife trade," said Dr Simon Stuart, Chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission.
"United for Wildlife has created a powerful opportunity where this momentum can be channelled into an internationally-focused and coordinated effort, to ignite political will and fight wildlife crime," he added. "IUCN will provide the necessary support and expertise to help prevent the tragic loss of such high-commercial value wildlife species."

Among United for Wildlife's commitments are strengething site protection in areas that contain target species; reducing the demand of illegal trade products by working with Governments and other organisations, such as marketing experts and youth leaders, to encourage appropriate consumer messaging to those who buy rhino horn, ivory, tiger and pangolin parts and products; engaging with the private sector to encourage a 'zero-tolerance' approach towards the illegal wildlife trade, supporting the judiciary and local authorities in their efforts to fight wildlife crime; supporting local communities, whose livelihoods are directly affected by the illegal wildlife trade.
This unprecedented collaboration of seven of the most influential field-based organisations and the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will bring together some of the world’s largest environmental bodies and harness the resources and expertise of global leaders in business, communications, technology and the creative industries to tackle this universal challenge.
The seven conservation organisations partnering the Royal Foundation for United for Wildlife are: Conservation International; Fauna & Flora International; the International Union for Conservation of Nature; The Nature Conservancy; Wildlife Conservation Society; WWF-UK; and the Zoological Society of London.
