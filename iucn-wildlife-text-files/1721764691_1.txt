The Blue Planet pavilion will bring us closer to the fascinating world of oceans and poles.  Set up to showcase films, launch new products and demonstrate cutting-edge technologies, it will also promote the exchange of knowledge and views on protection and management of these very special and productive ecosystems.  The pavilion will be open daily from 10.30 to 17.00 and from 18.30 to 21.00 during the Conservation Forum (September 7-11) and will remain open for networking during the IUCN Members’ Assembly (September 12, 14 & 15).
On top of the individual events, there will be two permanent displays:
• An immersive Google Earth experience using a chamber of monitors arranged in a circle around the viewer. The technology can fly the user anywhere in the world in seconds over mountains and buildings, down valleys, and even incorporates the ocean floor in peripheral vision.
• The Canadian Wildlife Federation’s interactive presentations highlight innovative approaches that engage new audiences in conservation. Marine, polar and youth programmes will be emphasized, including awareness of the development of a world youth movement. CWF is one of the oldest and largest not-for-profit charitable conservation organisations
