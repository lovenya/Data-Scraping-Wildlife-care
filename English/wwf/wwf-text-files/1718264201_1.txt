What challenges are rangers across Asia facing, and how can WWF improve their lives at work and beyond? 74% of the rangers surveyed believe they are not properly equipped to do their job. 74% Have you ever feared for your life while on the job? Does your work let you see your family more than a few days each month? These questions might seem strange, but for rangers working to protect endangered species, they reflect real concerns. According to a recent survey by WWF and the Ranger Federation of Asia, most rangers have experienced a life-threatening situation at work. The threats may come from wildlife, poachers, hazardous working conditions, or even other members of their communities. Many of these men and women lack the training and equipment necessary to ensure their safety, and almost half of them see their loved ones fewer than five days per month. Thirty percent cite low pay as the worst aspect of their job. Yet, despite these odds, most rangers remain so dedicated to nature and wildlife that over half say they hope to see their children in the same profession one day. WWF is using these survey results to inform the way we influence government policies to improve rangersâ€™ working conditions and make sure their basic needs are met. If we want to give tigers, rhinos, elephants, and other species a chance, we must provide rangers with the tools and training this research shows they require.
