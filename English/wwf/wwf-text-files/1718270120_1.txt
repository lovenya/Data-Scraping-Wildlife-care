Careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are on the rise- increasing from 21% in 2011 to 24% in 2021. And while men outnumber women, the number of women in the STEM workforce grew at 31% in that time period, a faster rate than men. Before International Day of Women and Girls in Science on February 11th, we asked some of our female scientists why they decided to pursue a career in conservation science specifically, and they all shared that access to nature in some way inspired their career choice.
