The Amazon is one of our greatest natural treasures—a place where natural and cultural diversity abound. It is humbling to think how little attention we give to the Amazon, despite its importance to the stability of the Earth's climate and the incredible array of wildlife it supports. So although the Amazon may not be in your backyard, it should be on your mind. Here are some ways you can help protect it from afar. 1. Let your voice be heard. Educate your family and friends about the importance of the Amazon, which is home to 10% of the known species on Earth. Then ask them to speak out for protecting the Amazon. Many people living in the Amazon witness environmental destruction that impacts their lives and their well-being, through no fault of their own, but they often lack the means and support to speak out against this. 1. Let your voice be heard. 2. Become a discerning consumer. Ask how your food and other purchases have been produced. Is your furniture, for example, made of wood from the Amazon? And, if so, is the wood sustainably harvested and certified to prove it? Many of the world’s most endangered species live in forests. One of the best ways to protect forests like the Amazon so that wildlife thrive is to buy products that have the FSC® label. 2. Become a discerning consumer 3. Reduce your use of fossil fuels, and your impact on the planet. The less fossil fuels used, the less impact climate change will have on the Amazon and other important natural areas. Support and demand renewable energy be part of the grid in your area. Turn off electric appliances when you’re not using them. Choose green energy providers for your household, or ask your provider for available options. Take public transport or ride your bike to work. 3. Reduce your use of fossil fuels, and your impact on the planet.
