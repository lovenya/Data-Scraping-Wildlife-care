There has never been a greater moment for ocean conservation. The links between the health of our global seas and the fight against climate change are strong. More political attention and public and private sector resources are going toward ocean conservation than ever before. And the poverty alleviation, food, and national security communities understand that healthy oceans are mission critical for prosperity and peace—at the community, national, and global levels. As such, now is the time to renew WWF’s commitment to ocean conservation. Over the course of the last year, with support from hundreds of internal and external collaborators, a group of amazingly dedicated people at WWF developed and today is launching our new ocean strategy. In closing, WWF’s Oceans team’s superpower is the diversity of its people. We are scientists, practitioners, subject matter experts, generalists, entrepreneurs, and strategists, and we all deliver impact and leadership across our portfolio of work. We bring deep experience from fieldwork, government service, business, finance, maritime security, academia, and more. We are excited about this next chapter in WWF’s ocean conservation journey and welcome the opportunity to partner to achieve big impact for the planet, people, prosperity, and peace.
