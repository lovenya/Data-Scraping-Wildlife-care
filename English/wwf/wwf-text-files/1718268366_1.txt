Sleek gray bodies glide through the water, hunting down small silvery fish. They zip down the river, following their prey, until they hear an unusual pinging sound that makes them stop just before swimming directly into an open fishing net. River dolphins in the Mahakam river have been at risk for many years in large part from getting accidentally caught in fishing nets. This is called bycatch. Over the last 25 years, two-thirds of river dolphins deaths in the Mahakam river were due to entanglements; only 80 dolphins are left in the surviving population. This is a common story in other major rivers as well, such as the Indus, Ganges, Irrawaddy, and Mekong.

In an effort to protect these animals from potentially fatal entanglements, and to benefit local fishers, an innovative project in Indonesia shows that attaching electronic devices, or “pingers”, that emit sounds to fishing nets help deter river dolphins from swimming too close to the nets.
