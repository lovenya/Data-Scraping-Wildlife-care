How to close that nature-financing gap? Increasingly it’s clear that we need to marry more traditional funding with nontraditional sources—market-based mechanisms such as carbon credits or wetlands banking; payments for ecosystem services like water fees; debt restructuring; and tourism fees. Almost all of those mechanisms depend on strong science-based data that quantifies the value that nature provides; links those benefits to financing; and guarantees greater integrity in how those markets function so they deliver beneficial results to communities and sovereign states. Research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows that $44 trillion of global GDP—around half of world economies—is highly or moderately dependent on nature. The WEF’s Global Risk Report 2023 could not be more stark. In its color-coded summary of the greatest risks to our global economy over the next 10 years, five of the top six threats are coded green to denote environmental threats: failure to mitigate climate change, failure of climate change adaptation, natural disasters and extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and natural resource crises. We have made so much progress for nature. But for us to truly succeed we must use both sides of our brains—both poetry and prose—to unlock the full measure of financial and political support needed to conserve the genius of nature, upon which we so profoundly depend. Which reminds me of the saying that the true worth of something is not evident until it’s gone. When it comes to nature, we can’t afford to wait that long. President & CEO View all issues h
