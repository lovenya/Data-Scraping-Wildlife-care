Lauren Tyler isn’t afraid of getting a little dirty—especially when it comes to protecting one of her lifelong passions: water. “Honestly, inside I’m still the same person I was when I was 10 years old,” says Tyler, laughing. Growing up in Ohio, she spent countless hours going “creeking”—wearing old tennis shoes and walking through nearby Rush Creek for “what seemed like miles” looking for tadpoles, frogs, and fish; turning over rocks; and basking in her independence and connection with nature. It also sparked her awareness that water, just like wildlife, needs protection. “There was a hospital a few miles up the creek, and every time I got closer to it, I saw oily bubbles of pollution in the water,” she says. “That upset me, and I’ve never forgotten it.” Creeking was her thing as a kid. Today, it’s swimming. “I’m a Masters swimmer, and I do open-water swims, mostly in Lake George [New York], whenever I can,” Tyler says. “And I’m constantly picking up whatever I find on my swims—plastic bottles, old sunglasses. Doing my little bit to keep the water clean makes me happy.” She describes herself as a water person and says that “being in the water is almost sacred to me—it’s where I find my peace.” Tyler has worked in the financial sector for more than 30 years and currently leads Human Resources at JP Morgan Chase for the Asset and Wealth Management business. She has also served as the company’s chief global auditor. Some might not see the connection between finance and conservation, but to Tyler it makes perfect sense. View all issues h
