Red pandas live in the Eastern Himalayas in places like China, Nepal, and Bhutan. They spend most of their time in trees. Their semi-retractable claws help them move easily from branch to branch. Red pandas rely on their long, bushy tails for balance as they cross tree branches. They also wrap it around themselves for warmth during the winter months. Red panda habitat is in decline. The loss of nesting trees and bamboo in the Eastern Himalayas—the location of almost 50% of the red panda’s habitat—is causing a decline in red panda populations across much of their range. WWF works with local communities to reduce human impact on the species’ habitat. These rusty-furred creatures tend to live alone, only rarely traveling in pairs or in families. Red pandas measure in at just larger than a domestic cat, making them much smaller than the famous giant pandas. Red pandas feed mainly on leaves and bamboo, but occasionally snack on fruit, insects, bird eggs and small lizards, too. WWF monitors red pandas and their habitat across India, Nepal, and Bhutan to better understand the species. We also work with yak herders and other community groups in Nepal to reduce human impact on the red panda’s fragile habitat.
