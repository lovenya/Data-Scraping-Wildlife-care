Sumatra’s Thirty Hills is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, home to critically endangered tigers, elephants, orangutans, and many other iconic species. In 2015, WWF-Indonesia and partners created PT Alam Bukit Tigapuluh (ABT)—which translates to ‘The Thirty Hills Forest Company’—to manage and restore 100,000 acres of intact lowland forest in this landscape. In addition to tigers, the survey team found Sumatran elephants, Sunda pangolins, Malayan tapir, and Sunda clouded leopards, among many others. In total, 14 protected species were captured, including several species of prey that tigers depend on, like deer and pigs. The survey identified five tigers. These results highlight the possibility that more tigers could live in the area. "Finally, we got a picture of datuk (local people call tigers “datuk”, which means grandfather)," Fendy said. He documented tigers in camera stations his team was responsible for and also discovered tiger bites on camera traps. “We were very encouraged to see that human activity in the forest was recorded on our camera traps at a low intensity,” said Dody Rukman, CEO of the ABT company. “Often, camera traps set up in the forest capture not only wildlife images, but poachers and illegal loggers as well. We think the fact there was little of this is evidence that ABT’s approach of collaborating with our neighboring communities to protect the forest is working.”
