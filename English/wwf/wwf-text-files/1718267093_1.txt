Millions of years ago, some photosynthetic plants underwent an incredible adaptation: They evolved the ability to eat meat. (Darwin called it “carnivorous syndrome.”) But while the appetites of most flesh-eating plants, such as Venus flytraps, lean mainly toward small insects, tropical pitcher plants have much more surprising diets, all uniquely adapted to their environments. Tropical pitcher plants, so called because of their hanging vase-shaped leaves, grow in places with nutrient-deficient soils. To survive, these plants evolved special mechanisms that allow them to entice, capture, and digest insects and other prey that give them the nitrogen and phosphorous they need to grow. One species, Nepenthes lowii, offers its nectar to mountain tree shrews in exchange for the droppings the animals leave behind, a nitrogen-rich food source the plant absorbs through its “toilet pitchers.” Nepenthes lowii In 2009, botanists in the Philippines discovered a new species of pitcher plant, Nepenthes attenboroughii (named for naturalist Sir David Attenborough). With stems reaching up to nearly 5 feet and pitchers that grow to roughly a foot in diameter, it’s the world’s largest carnivorous plant. Nepenthes attenboroughii Endemic to Borneo, Nepenthes rajah has enormous pitchers which can hold three quarts of liquid—and trap lizards and even small rodents. Nepenthes rajah View all issues h
