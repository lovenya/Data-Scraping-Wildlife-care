Lower Mekong river to remain free flowing as Sambor dam plans abandoned In a significant step forward for nature and communities that depend on the mighty Mekong River, the Cambodian government has abandoned plans to build the Sambor hydropower dam and has put a 10-year moratorium on any new dams on the Mekong mainstem. TheÂ Mekong River, flowing from the Tibetan Plateau through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam to the South China Sea, is home to spectacular biodiversity. Roughly 60 million people live in the region, many in poverty, and depend on the river and its tributaries for food and income.
