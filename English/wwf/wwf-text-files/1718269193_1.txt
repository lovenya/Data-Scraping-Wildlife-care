I have stared in solitary bliss, understanding very little or indeed, none of this. This earth, whose petals we all will selfishly to pick, this sky who day by day we poison sick, these waters whom each one of us without should live a low existence, hand to mouth. Then each and every monetary minute that whips us all that we no longer sing it, reminds Me, as a hunger pang of all the songs the ancients sang, of land that gave in grateful loads abounding, of harvest moons where village bells were sounding, of Gods & nymphs in sacred water dwelling that we, in grateful reverence tales were to telling; to our children, to the youth â€“ so the torch was carried forth and the wonders of the earth, were all treasured for their worth. Now I grow pale with watching as the heavens fill with smog, and the banks of every river start to fill and there with littered plastic clog, where parks become attractions as a cornered beast within a zoo and the wonders of the world are melted down to factory glue, I see conscience lay forgotten I see courtesy lie dead, and with both those pillars fallen stands a sorry tale instead.
