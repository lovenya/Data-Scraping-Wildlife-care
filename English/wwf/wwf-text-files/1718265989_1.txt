How fisheries in Ecuador are managing their catch and protecting the ocean If you’re like me, you probably feel guilty about eating shrimp. After all, a lot of the shrimp we eat today come from shrimp farms in the tropics, where they have been responsible for the clearing of mangrove forests. But on a recent trip to Ecuador, I learned about a small shrimp that has potential to be both good for the mangroves and for the local people that harvest it. Called the titi shrimp, it’s a little guy that you may have encountered at a Chinese restaurant, where they are often used in dishes like fried rice. Titi shrimp, or pomada, are wild shrimp, native to Ecuador, and they are harvested around the Gulf of Guayaquil by both trawlers and artisanal fishermen using a unique kind of trap that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. WWF-Ecuador has been working with both the industrial and artisanal fishermen to try to reduce conflicts between the two groups and ensure that the fishery is sustainable.
