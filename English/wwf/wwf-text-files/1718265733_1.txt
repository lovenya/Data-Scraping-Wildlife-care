The daughter of a fine art photographer, Zaria Forman grew up visiting remote and expansive regions, inspired by the “beauty and vastness of the ever-changing sky and sea.” Now, Forman smudges and blends pastels onto 5-, 7-, even 10-foot canvases to share these landscapes with us. Roused by a visit to Greenland, she creates works that reflect climate change from the North and South poles to the equator, and she knows the power of art to “move us in a way that statistics may not.” She says, “I hope my drawings serve as records of landscapes in flux, documenting the transition, and inspiring our global community to take action for the future.” Main image: WHALE BAY, ANTARCTICA NO. 4 Soft pastel on paper, 84" X 144", 2016.
