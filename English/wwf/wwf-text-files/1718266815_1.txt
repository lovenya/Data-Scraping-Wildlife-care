Entanglement in fishing nets and lines is among the greatest threats to sea turtles worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of turtles unintentionally caught by commercial fishing vessels every year. To address this bycatch problem, WWF partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and scientist Jesse Senko of Arizona State University, and the design for the world’s first solar-powered LED fishing net was born. Research indicates that turtles rely on visual cues when foraging for food. By illuminating fishing nets, scientists have been able to deter turtles and other species from approaching and becoming entangled, decreasing bycatch by 60% to 95%—without reducing the overall harvest. Scientists successfully tested the prototype in Baja California Sur, Mexico, where an average of six to eight turtles are accidentally caught per boat per day. That translates to thousands of turtles the new nets could save every year in that region alone. When fishers have to cut bycatch free from their nets, it costs them time and money. This design offsets the cost of conventional buoys, making it particularly cost-effective. View all issues h
