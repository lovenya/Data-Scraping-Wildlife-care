Lise Hanssen walks along the Kwando River near her camp as Timmy, her lanky, adopted village dog, bounds ahead. “He’s our early warning system for approaching wildlife,” she jokes as he barks into the trees. “Out here, we hear lions, hyena, and other animals all the time.” Hanssen is leader and sole employee of the Kwando Carnivore Project. She shares the camp with Timmy and her husband Paul Funston, who leads lion and cheetah programs for big-cat conservation group Panthera. The camp is a cozy clump of tents and reed structures at the edge of the Kwando River on Mudumu Conservancy land in Namibia’s far eastern Zambezi region, within the vast Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA). The family uses well water and a generator for power, and is linked to the broader world via satellite, cellphones, and a sandy, rutted road. View all issues h
