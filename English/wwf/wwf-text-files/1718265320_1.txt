Photographer and conservationist Joel Sartore wants his audience to “look these animals in the eye.” As the founder of the National Geographic Photo Ark, a project documenting the world’s species before they disappear, Sartore shoots his subjects portrait-style, removing all distractions and illuminating each individual animal’s essence. “There’s great intelligence and beauty to be discovered in all of Earth’s creatures,” says Sartore. “My hope is that the public eventually sees, and understands, that all are worth saving.” RED FAN PARROT 2011 RED FAN PARROT KOALAS 2011 KOALAS View all issues h
