Since childhood, most of us have become all too familiar with news of the destruction of the world’s forests, and the importance of planting trees, recycling paper, and buying sustainably produced goods to counteract the loss. However, grasslands and savannahs—other vital ecosystems in peril—are often overlooked. We don’t love grasslands like we should, perhaps because they are like forests, but miniature. While there are many iconic species in the grasslands like plains bison or pronghorn (antelope), most plant and animal life within grasslands is relatively tiny, remaining hidden from view from the casual observer. Perhaps our lack of appreciation comes from relating grasslands to our front lawns or a farmer’s field, likening them to blank slates that require taming and development to provide value. No matter the reasons, our disregard for grasslands is leading to devastating impacts.
