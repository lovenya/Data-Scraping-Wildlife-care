A new project produced in collaboration with private landowners across the Northern Great Plains will help fight the climate crisis by improving the health of 1 million acres of grasslands, increasing underground carbon storage, filtering clean water, and providing habitat for wildlife. WWF is joining forces with The Walmart Foundation, McDonald’s, and Cargill to invest more than $6 million in this initiative to make lasting improvements to America’s iconic grasslands. The new program, known as the Ranch Systems and Viability Planning network, will provide ranchers across the Northern Great Plains—focused mainly on Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota—with additional training and tools to help use even better grazing practices that improve the health of the land. This in turn will help provide habitat for wildlife and absorb carbon dioxide—a heat-trapping gas contributing to the climate crisis—from the atmosphere. WWF will work with ranchers on private and tribal lands to provide training in one-on-one and group workshops, offer ongoing technical expertise, and provide cost-share and monitoring to work with ranchers as they design, document, and implement ranch plans. Ranchers will be able to adapt their plans to improve conservation and economic outcomes and learn from other project participants.
