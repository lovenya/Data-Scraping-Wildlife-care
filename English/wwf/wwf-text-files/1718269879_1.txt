I started my role at WWF just as the pandemic struck and remote work began. It was a strange and challenging time—in our jobs, in our homes, and in our communities. But it was also a reminder of the importance of WWF’s mission. The fact that deforestation and environmental degradation are directly linked to the spread of diseases affirmed that I am in the right place, working on some of the most pressing issues that affect people’s daily lives. The other big thing the pandemic underscored for me was the value of fellowship. Earlier this year we had our first All-Together Day, where we brought the entire staff in to spend a day learning about their colleagues’ work and getting a chance to connect. Afterward I heard from a lot of people that they hadn’t really understood the breadth and scope of the organization they’d joined until that day. We have the power to inspire one another. That, perhaps more than anything else, makes me hopeful for the future. View all issues h
