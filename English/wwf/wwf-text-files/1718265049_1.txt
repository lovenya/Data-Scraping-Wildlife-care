Meet the recipients of the Russell E. Train Fellowship WWF would like to congratulate the recipients of the 2017 Russell E. Train Fellowship. Funded by the Russell E. Train Education for Nature Program (EFN), Train Fellows pursue their graduate degrees in conservation-related fields anywhere in the world and then return to their home countries better equipped to take on global conservation challenges. This year’s recipients include 24 outstanding conservationists from 11 countries throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Their collective research will help build capacity for climate adaptation, increase the number of individuals working on sustainable food systems, and protect crucial ecosystems throughout Mozambique and Myanmar. Each applicant was selected through a competitive, merit-based process from a pool of more than 150 applicants. Train Fellowships are named after the late Russell E. Train, founder and chairman emeritus of WWF-US, who was profoundly committed to building local conservation leadership and institutions throughout the world. To date, EFN has provided nearly $20 million in financial support to build capacity of more than 1,900 individuals and funded 615 organizations to conduct training workshops, collectively reaching more than 55,000 community members, indigenous people, park guards, fishers, and others. Until conservationists everywhere have a variety of opportunities to build the skills and knowledge they need in their home countries, EFN remains dedicated to building conservation capacity worldwide to protect Earth’s most spectacular natural environments for generations to come.
