Sandy-colored, allowing the jerboa to blend in with its desert surroundings A third longer than its head; handy for hearing stealthy predators Comically short, but perfectly suited for holding insects close to its mouth Connected to powerful legs and extremely elongated; act as springs when the jerboa hops Covered in tufts of stiff hair, which give the animal’s feet a firmer grip on slippery sand Serves as a prop when the jerboa stands upright.

JUMPING AND DODGING
The long-eared jerboa relies on its incredible jumping abilities to dodge birds of prey and other predators when it’s out foraging. Jerboas can also rapidly hop sideways to fake out and confuse their predators. JUMPING AND DODGING LONG-EARED JERBOA Euchoreutes naso Range Southern Mongolia to northwest China Range Size Body and head: 2.75"–3.5"; tail: 6"–6.4" Size Diet Consists almost entirely of insects Diet Threats Human disturbance from livestock grazing and presence of domestic cats; drought Threats Habitat Many jerboa species live in desert areas near oases or valleys. They forage for food in open areas with sparse vegetation—often to avoid competing with gerbils, which live in many of the same areas but prefer heavier vegetation. Habitat Species The long-eared jerboa is one of 33 jerboa species that are found from North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to Asia. Species Vertical reach Scientists haven’t determined exactly how high this particular jerboa species can jump, but some jerboas can leap up to six feet. Vertical reach View all issues h
