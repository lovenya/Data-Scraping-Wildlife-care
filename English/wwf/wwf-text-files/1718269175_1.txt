I don't want our daughter to know that Hawai'i is the bird extinction capital of the world. I don't want her to walk around the island feeling haunted by tree roots buried under concrete. I don't want her to fear the invasive predators who slither, pounce, bite, swallow, disease, and multiply. I don't want her to see paintings and photographs of birds she'll never witness in the wild. I don't want her to imagine their bones in dark museum drawers. I don't want her to hear their voice recordings on the internet. I don't want her to memorize and recite the names of 77 lost species and subspecies. I don't want her to draw a timeline with the years each was “first collected” and “last sighted.” I don't want her to learn about the Kaua'i 'O'o, who was observed atop a flowering 'Ohi'a tree, calling for a mate, day after day, season after season, because he didn't know he was the last of his kind— until one day, he disappeared, forever, into a nest of avian silence. I don't want our daughter to calculate how many miles of fencing is needed to protect the endangered birds that remain. I don't want her to realize the most serious causes of extinction can't be fenced out. I want to convince her that extinction is not the end. I want to convince her that extinction is just a migration to the last safe habitat on earth. I want to convince her that our winged relatives have arrived safely to their destination: a wondrous island with a climate we can never change, and a rainforest fertile with seeds and song.
