The need to protect and restore the world’s mangroves has never been greater. WWF is working not only in Mexico, but also in sites around the world, including in Colombia, Madagascar, and Fiji. Like Mexico, all of these are countries in which governments and communities have the capacity to increase and strengthen mangrove protection and management, with an emphasis on working under climate-smart principles to reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to climate change. “Mangroves must be protected. They are a powerful solution in the fight against climate change, and their importance to nature and livelihoods—in places like Boca de Camichín and elsewhere in Mexico, Colombia, Fiji, and Madagascar—cannot be overstated. We are proud to support WWF’s efforts to protect and restore these vital ecosystems.” These projects are only a part of WWF’s work on mangroves. Johan Bergenas, senior vice president for oceans at WWF-US, notes that “mangrove protection and restoration are vitally important in Mexico and in many other countries around the world.” We are grateful for the support of committed donors like the Bezos Earth Fund, Jida Bittner-Helle, Linda A. Mars, and the Grantham Trust who make those projects possible. View all issues h
