Layer by layer, tiny cut by tiny cut, Filipino artist Patrick Cabral crafts intricate paper sculptures of the world’s most threatened species. Cabral shares his work on social media to increase public awareness of conservation issues. “My art can help educate the younger generation about the plight of these species,” he says. “I want everyone to go beyond social media and contribute their time and presence to causes that are important to them.” Cabral is donating half of his species sculpture sales profit to WWF-Philippines.
