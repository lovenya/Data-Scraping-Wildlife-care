Mandy Barker grew up collecting shells and driftwood on the beach near her home on the British coast. Now, she collects plastic. Working alongside scientists and researchers, she transforms data on ocean plastics into arresting collages of pollution. By pairing beautiful images with the ugly facts they represent, Barker hopes to spur public outcry and legislative change. “Cleanups are brilliant to remove the plastic that’s there,” she says, “but we shouldn’t be needing to clean up. We should be stopping it from actually entering the ocean. That’s the most important thing.” Barker’s SOUP series is made from “plastic soup”—the plastic debris suspended in water, which constitutes 30% of the total plastic pollution that enters our oceans. (The other 70% sinks.) SOUP: ALPHABET
