“You would assume MPAs are always good for marine species, but we’ve never had solid evidence to really understand the magnitude and variation of ecological outcomes in the protected areas,” she says. “Preliminary data suggests that positive outcomes are often the case, but until we have more comprehensive data it’s hard to make a case for the true value of MPAs.” A majority of studies on MPA impacts, Ahmadia continues, have tended to be limited in their scope across either time or space. “Some studies have conducted time series experiments in an MPA, while others have conducted cross-section snapshots comparing reefs inside and outside an MPA. But both approaches are limited—neither allows you to accurately isolate the effects of the MPA.” View all issues h
