Two years ago this month, China took the monumental step of banning elephant ivory trade within the country. Dec. 31, 2017 was the last day it was legal to buy or sell ivory there. For elephant populations globally, and particularly in Africa, that had been devastated by a poaching epidemic in recent years, the ban was hailed as a game-changer. As Asia’s middle class expanded, rising demand for ivory carvings and jewelry helped drive a poaching crisis across Africa. More than 20,000 elephants annually are killed for their tusks. Yet two years later, China’s policy change appears to be having an impact. In the wake of the ban, WWF conducted annual surveys of Chinese consumers and found a promising decline in elephant ivory buying. Nearly 80 percent of respondents say they support the ban. And beyond the survey, we tracked black market activity and found that wholesale prices of ivory in the country have dropped. Unfortunately, we also found that one consumer group has actually increased its interest in buying ivory: people who regularly travel outside mainland China. That means that the consumers with the means to travel also have the most desire to keep buying elephant ivory. And their travel gives them access to ivory since some of the destinations most popular with Chinese travelers — Thailand, Laos, Hong Kong, Japan, and Vietnam — still have elephant ivory on the shelves. Despite the fact that it’s unlawful to bring the ivory out of one country into another without special permits, travelers still risk it.
