The Central Tian Shan mountain range presides over Kyrgyzstan with regal authority. Snow leopards, argali, ibex, and other rare animals meander across the alpine grasslands, glaciers, and snow-covered slopes, taking particular refuge in the vast Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve. There, these animals find protection from unlikely guardians: the residents of nearby mountain communities. From hunters to healers
These villages once thrived on government paychecks as mining outposts for the Soviet Union. After the empire’s collapse, they were all but forgotten, and residents—like Omurbek Kurmanaliev of Ak Shyrak—resorted to poaching for survival. From hunters to healers But these remote communities are again demonstrating their resilience. With help from the USAID-funded Asia High Mountains project, the community is pursuing sustainable, income-generating alternatives to livestock raising. This includes helping local women produce and market handicraft products and building an ecotourism industry at the reserve. WWF has also been demonstrating yak herding as a lucrative climate-smart alternative to keeping domestic sheep and goats, since yaks can withstand snowfalls and cold temperatures better, require less care, and are less susceptible to predators. The demonstration herd that was started with 23 yaks several years ago has since grown to 66, and will soon be used to help local families start their own yak herds. For Omurbek, adaptation is a way of life. Largely forgotten in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse, he and the other residents of these small Kyrgyz mountain towns are proving that, with a little help, they can become global models as guardians of the world’s snow leopards and other high mountain wildlife.
