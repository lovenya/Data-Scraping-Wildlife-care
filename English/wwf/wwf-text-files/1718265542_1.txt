The FSC label indicates material sourced from a responsibly managed forestâ€”meaning in part that wildlife habitat is protected, the legal rights of indigenous communities in or near the forest are upheld, and the use of highly hazardous chemicals is restricted. Nearly all wood products in the Hood River house have a link to FSC: FSC 100%: Wood sourced entirely from FSC-certified forests FSC 100%: FSC MIX: A mix of FSC 100%, FSC recycled, and/or materials certified as being of low risk for environmental or social impacts FSC MIX: FROM THE FOREST TO YOU
The path from responsibly managed forest to builder is established through chain-of custody certification. Independent auditing at each step of the supply chain ensures the final product can be traced all the way back to the source.
