When it comes to conservation, Gerald Butts considers himself a “skeptical optimist.” “I think people are fundamentally good, and looking to build communities that are in closer harmony with nature,” he says. No doubt that viewpoint has its roots in Butts’s childhood spent on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. “I’m biased, but it’s one of the most beautiful places on Earth,” he says. “That’s where my love of nature came from, because I was surrounded by so much of it.” Butts also grew up understanding the central role that natural resources played in his community’s economy. His parents worked at the coal mine in his hometown—his dad as a miner, his mom as a nurse. Shortly after his father retired, an explosion at the mine killed 10 people, closing it permanently. “I also happened to grow up at the time of the Atlantic cod fishery collapse,” Butts says. “So it was hard to escape the tensions brewing between the beauty and bounty of the natural world and the pressure that human beings were putting on it.” Butts has made a career of understanding the economic, social, political, and environmental dynamics—and their associated implications—at play around the world. Currently, he works at Eurasia Group advising clients on climate change, trade, energy, sustainable finance, and more. He also served as principal secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and was president and CEO of WWF-Canada. Butts joined the WWF-US Board of Directors in 2022. View all issues h
