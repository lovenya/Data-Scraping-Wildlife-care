“The beauty of a coral reef is in its diversity; nature is more creative than I could ever be,” says Courtney Mattison, a Los Angeles-based sculptor and ocean advocate. While earning a degree in marine ecology and ceramic sculpture, Mattison began creating intricate, vibrantly hued works depicting coral reefs and the threats they face from climate change. To craft her large-scale wall reliefs, often evocative of swirling hurricanes or coral bleaching events, she uses tools such as paintbrushes and chopsticks, molding fragile underwater ecosystems in hopes of inspiring increased protections for our oceans. “We protect what we care about,” she says. “I want to bring the beauty of coral reefs above the ocean’s surface and make people fall in love.” View all issues h
