“Belize’s beauty lies not only in nature, but in the connections communities have maintained with the sea for generations. It makes these ecosystems disappearing even scarier,” says writer Emiliano Rodríguez Mega (“Eyes on the water in Beliz”). Based in Mexico City, Mega has written for Science and Scientific American. Photographer Thomas Lee was moved by his time at Fort Peck and Fort Belknap Indian Reservations (“Buffalo people unite”). “To watch people preserve and adapt their great culture is uplifting,” explains Lee. “I feel honored that they shared some of that with us.” Lee’s latest book is titled Montana: Real Place, Real People. Illustrator Dieter Braun (“Buffalo people unite”) really loves wildlife: “I’m obsessed,” he claims. And bison are no exception. These hulking creatures are among the species featured in the German artist’s latest book, Wild Animals of the North. Braun’s work has appeared in the New York Times and other publications.
