A couple of years ago, in a London park, photographer Eduard Florin Niga’s daughter asked him, “Do ants have eyes?” Niga answered her question by photographing as many ant portraits as possible, using a variety of magnifying camera lenses to capture each species’ quirks, like pincers, iridescent skin, and hairy faces. Ants aerate soil and provide food for bigger animals, but Niga worries that people don’t care about these insects because we don’t often see them up close. His new book, Ants: Workers of the World, was published last May. His ongoing mission? “Photograph anything that’s too small to appreciate.” POLYRHACHIS BECCARII worker POLYRHACHIS BECCARII OECOPHYLLA SMARAGDINA worker OECOPHYLLA SMARAGDINA DACETON ARMIGERUM worker DACETON ARMIGERUM RHYTIDOPONERA METALLICA queen RHYTIDOPONERA METALLICA CAMPONOTUS FULVOPILOSUS  major worker CAMPONOTUS FULVOPILOSUS ECITON HAMATUM  major worker ECITON HAMATUM DORYLUS SP. male DORYLUS SP.
