The Jeevan Jyoti Lower Secondary School’s concrete floors and corrugated iron walls bounce sound from one classroom to another. Beside the school lies a pile of rubble; on either side of the valley where it sits, landslides cut jagged lines across the dark hillsides.

Almost 9,000 people were killed and over 20,000 injured. More than 80% of Nepal’s population lives in rural areas—most in homes made of stone, mud, and thatch.
