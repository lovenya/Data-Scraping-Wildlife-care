You are receiving this copy of our magazine in May of the year 2020, which the world will remember as an extraordinary time—a time when the connections between people everywhere became more conspicuous and critical than ever, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our connections have become undeniable in terms of risks and how our behavior affects others, but even more profoundly in terms of the utter necessity of those connections in our everyday lives and in meeting the needs of our families and our communities. Our human family has rarely needed each other more. And while we know that these are extraordinary times, we also know that the work of conservation must go on. So at WWF we are reimagining how we deliver against our mission in these unprecedented circumstances. We are operating virtually—connecting via computer screens and phone lines—across WWF’s far-flung, international network of offices. In the best way we can, we continue our work with governments and institutions and other important partners to safeguard landscapes and protected areas that are fundamental to the provision of food, water, livelihoods, and more, to some of the most fragile communities around the world. We are learning to navigate a new normal, and extending each other the kindness and flexibility we all need right now is paramount. Carter Roberts
