Large carnivores, like tigers or leopards, are considered “umbrella species” because conserving their populations in healthy numbers also provides protection to large areas of their habitat that many other species depend on for homes and resources. They also serve as important indicator species to understanding the impacts of human activities on the surrounding ecosystem. Healthy populations of umbrella species often indicate a healthy overall ecosystem and vice versa. In an effort to better understand them, placing radio collars on large carnivores can provide scientists with valuable data on their individual movements, land range, social behavior, and interactions with prey species. Collaring these animals can also help reduce human-wildlife conflict by acting as early warning devices for livestock owners. Knowing when carnivores will be in proximity to their land can enable farmers to secure and protect their livestock and thus reduce potential conflict. Between September and November of 2020, WWF, in partnership with Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) and Panthera—a carnivore conservation NGO—collared a total of six carnivores in the Sioma Ngwezi National Park in the Silowana Complex, an area nestled between the Zambezi River and the Angolan and Namibian borders in Southern Africa. A female wild dog, a male lion, and a lioness were the first to be captured and collared, followed by two more lions and another wild dog collared a couple of months later. It is useful to collar both sexes of each species to monitor how they use their areas differently.
