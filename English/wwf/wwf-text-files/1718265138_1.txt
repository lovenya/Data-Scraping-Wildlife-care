Our jeeps lurch over a dry creek bed as we navigate the dense subtropical forest of Nepal’s Bardia National Park. Branches of towering sal trees reach to the edge of the track, their large, broad leaves grazing our windows. Rounding a slight curve, the lead jeep comes to a stop ahead. We climb out to see fresh tiger paw prints in the powdery brown dirt—those of a large male and a smaller female. Like us, the cats are traveling the path of least resistance through the forest, no more than a half hour ahead of us, as we make our way to Babai Valley, nestled in the heart of the park.

Six years ago, such a trek through this park in the shadow of the Himalayas was, for me, merely a dream. I was pursuing a graduate degree in environmental and natural resource policy, determined to develop a career that helped protect wildlands and combat climate change.

My graduate program involved field work in a coffee-producing community in Costa Rica, where previously forested hillsides were denuded by livestock and converted to agricultural production. Working with coffee farmers to restore the forests and reduce carbon emissions brought into focus for me the benefits of conservation and the connections between natural landscapes, people, and wildlife.

Fast forward, and dreams have become reality; I am bouncing in the back of this jeep through prime tiger habitat in Bardia. Five miles from the main road, we reach Babai Valley, the emerald of Nepal. Steep forested hills encircle healthy grasslands, and forests cover the valley floor. Despite the development pressures a stone’s throw away, the valley is a unique oasis for endangered species.
