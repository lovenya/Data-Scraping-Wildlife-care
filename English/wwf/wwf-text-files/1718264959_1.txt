In 2013, Jinjing began working with WWF and The Coca-Cola Company to convert 100 percent of its productions to sustainable practices, including building water-collecting and irrigation systems and constructing wetlands. As a result, Jinjing has helped minimize pollution from diffused agricultural sources in the Yangtze’s tributaries. Fan Tianming, vice president of Jinjing, says the original incentive to work sustainably was economic: the tea market was in a rut in the 1990s, and his company saw sustainably-sourced products booming outside China. The conversion has paid off. Sales improved, agriculture-generated pollution dropped, and corporate sponsorships popped up. In 2015, the company’s turnover reached RMB300 million ($44 million US). Does all this effort actually make the tea taste better? Not exactly, says Er. Chemical fertilizers make the tea sweeter and greener. But Er says the gains for the environment, his workforce, and his customers are a worthy trade-off. And the land surrounding the plantation provides evidence of all these gains. Vibrant populations of birds, frogs, mushrooms and edible ferns have returned, helping restore biodiversity to the region.
