Breeding facilities, also known as tiger farms, continue to fuel the illegal trade of tigers and their parts. More than half of tigers seized in Thailand and almost a third of those seized in Vietnam all came from such breeding facilities. In 2016, a seizure at just one tiger farm in Thailand found 187 tigers. The proportion of whole tigers—both alive and dead—seized by law enforcement has also been significantly larger since 2016 than in proceeding years. The findings--all part of a new report by TRAFFIC, the global wildlife trade monitoring network.
