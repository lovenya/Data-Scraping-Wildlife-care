After Brenda Davis’s father earned his degree in biology from San Diego State University, he took a job as a park ranger at Point Lobos State Natural Reserve near Carmel, California. Davis was almost three years old when she moved with her family to the reserve, where they lived in the iconic Whalers Cabin (now a museum, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007), overlooking Whalers Cove and Carmel Bay. “My mom did all of our cooking on a wood stove there,” she recalls. “My very earliest memories are there, in that Whalers Cabin.” While Davis and her family lived in the Whalers Cabin, her sister was born, and she remembers walking her in a buggy on park trails with her mother. She soaked up every aspect of nature she could. “My father made games of teaching me about the wildflowers, birds, and marine life in the park,” she says. “For a young child like me, it was pretty much paradise.” Later, when she was six years old, the family moved to Anchorage, Alaska. It was 1955 and Alaska had yet to become a state. “It was really still kind of a frontier outpost,” Davis says. (There was no phone or car for the family’s first year there.) Davis grew up surrounded by immense wilderness, raised by parents who put tremendous value on the importance of the natural world. “We lived a remarkable outdoor life, as you can imagine.” And while there was development going on in Anchorage at the time, Davis remembers that people seemed to be more in balance with nature then. “My dad would hunt a moose every fall for us and that’s what we lived on,” she says. “And we caught a lot of salmon every summer. We’d freeze it and can it and smoke it and eat it all winter. I was at least in my thirties before I could eat salmon again,” Davis says with a laugh. View all issues h
