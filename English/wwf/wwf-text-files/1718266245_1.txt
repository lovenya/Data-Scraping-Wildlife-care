Deforestation and forest degradation are urgent matters when it comes to our world’s forests: about 47% of the world’s forests are at high risk for deforestation or degradation by 2030. While both are damaging to forest health, there is a difference between deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation refers to the clearing of a forest, entirely removing it to put something else in its place. The main driver of deforestation is unsustainable and illegal agriculture—making room for cash crops like palm oil and rubber. The realities of deforestation are staggering; we’re losing forests at a rate equivalent to 27 soccer fields per minute. There is hope for stopping forest degradation. WWF is working around the world to establish a coordinated, no-tolerance response to unsustainable and illegal logging. We work internationally to strengthen and enforce laws, and in the US to keep illegal wood products out of the country. WWF also assists some of the world’s biggest companies to invest in and demand wood that is harvested, processed, transported and traded legally and responsibly, shifting the entire market toward better practices. And the good news is that consumers can do their part by purchasing wood and paper products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The FSC label guarantees that trees were harvested in an environmentally and socially conscious way, including provisions to ensure adherence with local, national and international laws. This simple action, when combined with the work of governments, businesses, and organizations like WWF, is the best way to stop forest degradation and ensure our forests remain healthy and productive for people and wildlife.
