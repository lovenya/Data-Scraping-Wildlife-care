Brad Wilson spent years photographing people before turning his lens to a less traditional portrait subject: wildlife. Wilson’s Affinity series brings viewers eye to eye with species ranging from African elephants to barn owls. “I wanted to give the impression of stepping into a shared space with these animals, of being on an equal playing field with them,” Wilson says. See more images from Wilson’s new book Wild Life at bradwilson.com. The rhinos in this video live at the ABQ BioPark in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as part of the rhinoceros Species Survival Program (SSP). Conservation efforts, including SSPs, have increased the world’s white rhino population to more than 20,000 individuals. View all issues h
