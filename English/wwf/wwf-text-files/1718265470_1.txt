In honor of Earth Day, WWF and Google’s CS First program are teaming up to help kids and classrooms code their own Google Logo in celebration of wildlife and nature. ‘Create your own Google Logo’ for Earth day is a free computer science and environmental lesson that can be completed in a classroom or at home. In this activity, kids may tell a story about their favorite wild animals or show how they want to protect the planet through their own personal Google Logo. WWF and Google know that technology and coding play an important role in protecting the earth’s animals and their habitats. Together, we collaborate on solutions to conservation's most pressing issues, including protecting wildlife and stopping wildlife crime. Now, through this Earth Day activity, the next generation can learn basic coding skills and the innovative ways programming can be used to make a difference in the world. Get started now
