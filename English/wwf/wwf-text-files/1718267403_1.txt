Dr Sena is a member of the African Commission Working Group on Indigenous Populations and chaired the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.

By fighting for their lands, Indigenous peoples are fighting to save the planet. Although they comprise less than 5% of the world population, Indigenous peoples protect 80% of the Earth’s biodiversity in the forests, deserts, grasslands, and marine environments in which they have lived for centuries. However, despite their critical role in ensuring a resilient and healthy planet for people and nature, there is very little acknowledgment of, or support for, their efforts, especially in Africa. There are emerging opportunities to drive this discussion. Foremost is increasing recognition by key institutions like the IPCC, the World Bank, the African Union, governments, and NGOs of the nexus between secure community rights and addressing global environmental challenges. Secondly, regional courts and commissions, and national courts, have issued decisions that entrench Indigenous peoples’ land rights, recognizing these rights were not extinguished by formal colonial or post-colonial laws. Third, women’s land rights, including in Indigenous communities, are receiving increasing global attention. This will help reduce internal land-related dynamics among Indigenous communities.
