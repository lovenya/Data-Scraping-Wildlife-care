Soil is home to a quarter of all species on Earth. Here’s why we need to keep it healthy. Soil is a lot more than just dirt. It’s a living, breathing ecosystem that’s home to a quarter of all species on Earth. That richness of life is what supports forests and prairies; biodiversity in the soil also enhances agriculture. Many underground organisms process the nutrients that allow plants to flourish above ground. They also protect plants from disease, help soil store more water, make nitrogen and other key elements more readily accessible, and enable plants to communicate with each other. They even help fight climate change by pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and turning them into food and oxygen. Yet agriculture, which needs soil, is the leading cause of its erosion. Indeed, healthy soil is disappearing from the surface of the earth at a rate of about 24 billion tons a year. That’s why WWF is working with food and forestry companies, farmers, scientists, banks, policymakers, and others to foster regenerative practices that enrich soil and the diversity of life within and above it. Here are some examples of the types of living creatures in soil that make it such a vibrant, vital habitat.
