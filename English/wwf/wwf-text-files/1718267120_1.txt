We all benefit from this collaboration between people and nature because mangroves help the whole world. Mangroves are excellent at storing carbon deep in their rich soils, which helps to slow down climate change. Mangrove communities play a big role, but so can those far away from these coastal forests: Commit to lowering the impact of climate change by joining WWFâ€™s pledge to reduce food waste and look for renewable energy alternatives to fossil fuels. WWF is dedicated to supporting these forests and communities both directly, and through programs like the Global Mangrove Alliance which promotes the protection of these valuable ecosystems at multiple levels of community, governance, and research.
