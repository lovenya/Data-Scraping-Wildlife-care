What can we learn about an ecosystem by analyzing its water? More than you might expect. Water—like soil, air, and snow—contains DNA naturally shed by animals through their hair, feces, saliva, and skin. Studying this environmental DNA, or eDNA, can give us a snapshot of the health of an ecosystem and its species. And while it might sound like a tool from your favorite true crime podcast, eDNA has enabled big strides in wildlife monitoring. WWF scientists will soon use eDNA alongside camera traps to conduct a survey of tigers and their prey in Bhutan’s Royal Manas National Park. If the methods yield similar results, eDNA sampling could complement camera traps in future national tiger surveys, substantially reducing survey costs. eDNA sampling is faster and, in some cases, more comprehensive than other monitoring methods: In a WWF study in British Columbia between 2018 and 2019, eDNA sampling of stream water detected 25% more terrestrial mammals than camera trapping did, because many—including several bat species—were too small to trigger cameras.
