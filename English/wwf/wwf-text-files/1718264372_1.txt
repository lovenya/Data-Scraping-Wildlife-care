The following piece was written by summer WWF intern Kate Rasmussen to offer readers a glimpse into the life of a next-generation rancher from the Northern Great Plains, one of the largest remaining intact grasslands in the world. These grasslands are dependent on grazing animals, and these days, cattle are an important part of that equation. WWF is partnering with organizations such as the South Dakota Grasslands Coalition in support of ranching families and grassland managers like the Rasmussen family. Without their land stewardship, many of our nation’s intact grasslands would be converted to cropland and other uses, posing a serious threat to this disappearing ecosystem. Ranching operations in this vast region not only contribute to thriving rural communities, they also provide for clean water, soil carbon storage, and havens for grassland bird species and other wildlife. A day spent fencing on our family’s ranch in South Dakota usually begins with a one-sided conversation with my dog and ends with tired arms pulling a handful of hopeful ticks out of my hair. The perks of the job include trekking long distances across the prairie, scrambling through badlands to string barbwire, replacing old posts, and sidestepping crabby rattlesnakes. A significant portion of fencing involves tearing out old cedar posts that were set in place by my dad when he was my age. I have a ritual of smelling each one where they’ve splintered off next to the ground before replacing them with new steel posts.
