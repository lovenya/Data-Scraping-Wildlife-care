The protection of forests plays a key role in protecting human health, from providing nutrition to helping us manage disease. Infectious diseases that find a home in people have always existed and probably always will. But something about COVID-19 and the rate at which it has spread compared to other outbreaks seems new. While many of these pathogens are present in wildlife and have been for longer than people generally know, some emergent infectious viruses that have spilled over from animal populations include SARS, MERS, HIV, and many more localized outbreaks of even deadlier diseases such as Nipah and Ebola. The transmission of disease has changed because of how interconnected people are across the world. The protection and restoration of species habitat, combined with reducing human pressures on wildlife is a critical step in preventing emergent infectious disease. These actions also have some interesting and positive impacts on two of the more persistent challenges to life on Earth, climate change and global biodiversity loss.
