They helped increase incentives for Bahamian fishers to work toward MSC certification. A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS RECALIBRATING
Through the project, more accurate and abundant data about the health of the spiny lobster stock became available, and a November 2017 stock assessment found spiny lobsters to be at greater risk for overfishing than previously thought. To protect the Bahamian spiny lobster from overfishing, scientists recommended decreasing the permitted export amount. RECALIBRATING TIGHTENING THE BELT
In January 2018, with the adamant support of a broad conservation coalition that included the Bahamas Spiny Lobster Working Group, the Department of Marine Resources, and 14 Bahamian lobster exporters, the government formally limited export of lobster to 5 million lb per season (down from 7 million). The new rule took effect in August 2018. TIGHTENING THE BELT STAMPED FOR SUCCESS
On August 7, 2018, the Bahamian lobster fishery became the first Caribbean fishery to be MSC certified. The MSC blue fish label is a win all around: The local ecosystem continues to thrive, Bahamians secure their prized species for generations, exporters protect their supply chain, and consumers eat their lobster with confidence ... and a dab of melted butter.
