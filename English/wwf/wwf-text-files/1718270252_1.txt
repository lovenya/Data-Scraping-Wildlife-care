The first Europeans to encounter bare-nosed wombats likened them to bears—and the comparison stuck. The species’ scientific name, Vombatus ursinus, combines the Latin word for bear with one from the Aboriginal Dharug language. But this cuddly looking herbivore is actually a marsupial whose closest cousin is another Australian favorite, the koala. The wombat is the largest burrowing mammal—shown here to scale with an average adult man. RANGE Pockets of habitat in southeast Australia

HABITATS Temperate forests, open woodlands, grasslands, and scrublands RANGE LENGTH WEIGHT HABITATS Surprisingly for such a roly-poly critter, the wombat’s poop resembles a charcoal briquette. The flat sides mean the scat stays put, making for efficient territory-marking. The bare-nosed wombat used to be called the common wombat, now a misnomer given the species’ fragmented populations. Two other wombat species are even less common: the southern hairy-nosed and the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed, which was restricted to a single population in a national park until reintroduced to a second site in 2009. The wombat is a world-class digger, creating up to a dozen multiroomed underground homes. Each burrow usually has a single entrance, which the wombat can block with its hard-plated bum to defend against predators. Wombats sometimes share their lairs with other mammals, reptiles, and penguins. View all issues h
