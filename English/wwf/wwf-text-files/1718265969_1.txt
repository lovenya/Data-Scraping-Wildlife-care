The United States took an important step forward in the global fight to tackle trash in our oceans. Nearly 124,000 WWF activists from 49 states reached out to their member of Congress to support a bipartisan bill to take a stand on ocean plastic, and their impressive efforts paid off. The Save Our Seas Act passed! This means we're one step closer to less trash, more research, and a brighter future for both wildlife and people who depend on healthy oceans. Scientists estimate that more than 8.8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans every year. Without action, experts predict that there could be a pound of plastic for every three pounds of fish in the ocean within the next decade. Ocean trash affects everything from the smallest plankton to the biggest whales. Sea turtles, for instance, often confuse plastic bags for food. And dolphins and other marine life can become entangled in old fishing gear. That’s why it’s so important that tens of thousands of our activists spoke up. “WWF’s ambitious goal is for nature to be plastic-free by 2030,” said Erin Simon, WWF's director of private sector engagement, sustainability R&D. “This will require fixing what’s broken across complex waste management systems. Government action and good public policy are critical to enabling the solutions we need, and the passage of the Save Our Seas Act is a welcome step in the right direction.” Learn more about protecting our oceans.
