To create many of the products we wear and consume, and even the food we eat, manufacturers often apply heat—for washing, drying, cooking, sterilizing, and more. That heat is typically generated from fossil fuels. That heat is typically generated from fossil fuels. In fact, the fuels used for industrial thermal processes represent the third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, after those powering the transportation and electricity sectors. But despite being a substantial contributor to climate change, thermal energy has been largely ignored in attempts to limit emissions. fuels used for industrial thermal processes represent the third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U S In 2017, WWF set out to change that, convening the Renewable Thermal Collaborative (RTC) in partnership with the strategic advisory firm David Gardiner and Associates and the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. The collaborative seeks to slash carbon emissions from industry and other large energy buyers—like universities and city governments—by scaling up renewable alternatives for providing thermal energy. In 2021, RTC received a substantial investment boost toward that goal when it was selected from among 68 competitors and awarded $10 million through the 2030 Climate Challenge run by Lever for Change, an organization that connects philanthropists with projects taking on major societal challenges.
