At the turn of the 21st century, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made a groundbreaking pledge: to triple the amount of forests under protection in his country’s portion of the Amazon and create a network of protected areas larger than the state of California. At the time, Brazil’s commitment was a powerful claim that the country could, and would, secure the globally important ecosystem services the Amazon provides, from freshwater and biodiversity to carbon sequestration. The good news is that PFP doesn’t have to be applied in a vast number of locations to make a huge difference. As Dillon points out, nearly 90% of the Amazon region—which is 14 times the size of California and essential to the survival of the planet because of its role as a habitat, natural resource, and carbon-sequestration mechanism—is located in just three countries: Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, all of which are now PFP project sites.
