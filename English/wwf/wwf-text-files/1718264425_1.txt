For six years, Melissa Papp found solace in the eyes of a lioness named Kia at a zoo near her Florida home. She’d spend weekends sitting by the enclosure and watching the big cat move about her day. Sometimes they’d rest side by side—just a sheet of glass between the two of them. “It was almost Zen in a way,” Papp said. “It was where I found myself calm and relaxed. She knew me. She knew my smell, my voice, my sound.” A constant reminder
When Papp’s schedule grows too hectic and her thoughts become cluttered, she takes a breath and draws her mind back to the image of Kia, the lioness. It’s a reminder of the beauty of life and why we need to protect it. A constant reminder “That’s how I learned the art of silence and how to just be in that moment,” Papp said. “I picture her face and remember how special she is to me.” Papp wants to provide all animals—from well-known megafauna to lesser-known critters—with that same level of respect. And that means keeping the planet healthy and vibrant. “It’s our home,” Papp said. “We don’t have another place to go.” Learn more about WWF’s Panda Ambassador program and how you can help.
