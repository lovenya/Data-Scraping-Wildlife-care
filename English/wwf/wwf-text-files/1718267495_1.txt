From the air we breathe to the wood we use, forests are essential to our lives. They are home to more than half of the world's land-based wildlife species, and globally more than 1 billion people live in and around forests and rely on them for food, shelter, and livelihoods. After oceans, forests are the largest storehouses of carbonâ€”critical in the fight against the climate crisis. Agriculture is the leading driver of deforestation around the world. A growing global population and increased food consumption have led to many forests being converted into farms. The type of agriculture varies by geography but includes predominantly commercial agriculture, smallholder farming, and cattle ranching in Latin America; subsistence and small-scale commercial farming in Africa; and commercial agriculture and vast plantations in Asia.
