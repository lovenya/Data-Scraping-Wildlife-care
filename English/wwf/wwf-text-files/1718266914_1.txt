In this unprecedented and uncertain time, top of mind for all of us is the health, safety, security, and well-being of our families, employees, supporters, partners, and the community at large. We are all impacted by this pandemic, and strangely, there is a sense of solidarity and reflection that is bringing us all together as one connected community in this time of crisis. A crucial part of WWF’s work on a “normal” day is addressing the challenge of how to produce and make accessible adequate nutritious food for a growing global population while ensuring the health of our planet. We seek to achieve this goal through the conservation of our vital landscapes and efficient use of resources while avoiding food loss and waste and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
But as the world is facing a global health crisis, the foundations of our food system are also called into question, along with the interactions between people and the natural resources we all depend on.
