Ten years since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill— the worst in US history—marine waters and coastal areas of America’s Arctic are more vulnerable to human-made disasters today than ever before. In the years that followed, attempts to explore for oil and gas thousands of miles away in the Arctic amounted to a fiasco. The federal government made substantial reforms in the first few years following these disasters, but the Trump administration has since weakened measures designed to prevent the next offshore oil spill from happening. Offshore oil and gas development and large-scale shipping pose a substantial threat to wildlife populations and habitats already struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing climate. The threat of a large oil spill also compounds the climate-related difficulties faced by coastal communities, which are already experiencing dangerous storms and food insecurity and adapting their subsistence lifestyles to survive the impacts of climate change.
