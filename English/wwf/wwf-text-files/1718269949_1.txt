Across all eight socioeconomic metrics, the rapid transition scenario achieves materially greater benefits for people—including improved food security, human health, and livelihoods—compared to business-as-usual. Risks to biodiversity, natural habitats, and ecosystems are significantly lower in a rapid transition to renewables compared to a business-as-usual future. The mining footprint for critical minerals needed for a rapid transition to renewable energy future will be far smaller than the land spared from decommissioned coal mining. Considering both the total footprint of energy development and that of climate change-related land loss and degradation, the projected total land (and ocean) area impacted is lower in a rapid transition scenario compared with a business-as-usual fossil fuel energy system. The quality of water will significantly improve if we transition rapidly to renewable energy, resulting in massive human health benefits. Air and quality will significantly improve if we transition rapidly to renewable energy, resulting in massive human health benefits. Emissions of air pollutants are between 60%-90% lower with a rapid transition to renewable energy by 2050 compared with a business-as-usual fossil fuel energy system.
