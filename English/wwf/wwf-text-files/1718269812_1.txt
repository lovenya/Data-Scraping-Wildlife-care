Back in 2010, with wild tiger numbers at an all-time low of about 3,200 individuals, the world’s 13 tiger range countries—with support from conservation partners including WWF—made a global goal to double wild tiger numbers by 2022. Today, the new population estimate from the Global Tiger Forum is about 5,574 wild tigers. Notable advancements in how we invest in and monitor tigers can be seen in this new number which demonstrates about a 74% increase since 2010.



This is a rare and exciting conservation achievement as the new estimate moves tiger numbers ever closer to the shared goal of doubling tiger populations. Over the past 12 years, tiger numbers have increased in Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Russia. As tiger numbers increase in some areas thanks to effective strategies and great dedication, tiger range and habitat continue to decline in most areas. We are working to reverse the trend of tiger habitat destruction and fragmentation. Investing in Tiger Landscapes
WWF has developed a new strategy that prioritizes work in 22 tiger landscapes and helps achieve the shared vision of the Tiger Conservation Coalition.  Recognizing that even as tiger numbers increase, tiger populations cannot fully recover if their range and habitat continue to decrease. Across these priority tiger landscapes, conservation efforts will be focused on: Investing in Tiger Landscapes Even if the progress has been uneven and is still extremely fragile, the fact that many tiger populations are recovering is extraordinary conservation. And it’s a call to action, for greater political commitment and investments in tiger conservation.
