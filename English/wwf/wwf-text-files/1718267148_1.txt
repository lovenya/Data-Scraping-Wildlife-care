From 2014 to 2018, tillage of grasslands across the Great Plains occurred at an average rate of four football fields lost every minute. This means that millions of acres of America’s temperate grassland, one of only four left in the world and a critically important ecosystem, is being plowed up for crop production. This is the type of shocking conversion rate that, sadly, we’ve grown accustomed to hearing about when we talk of the destruction of the Amazon or melting arctic glaciers. These problems are devastating of course but can often feel as though they are happening far away and out of our reach. But how many of us were aware that another environmental catastrophe of similar proportions is occurring right here in America’s backyard? A growing amount of research suggests that the diversity of plants, insects, and soil microbes that are found within untilled grasslands vastly outnumbers that which can generally be achieved through restoration. Grasslands, which are also known as prairies, are slow to recover and plant and animal populations can take decades or longer to return once they’ve been erased from the land for agriculture. Native grassland seeds are expensive and often hard to come by so most seeding restoration projects use only around three to seven plant species, whereas plant diversity on native grasslands can range as high as 305 plant species.
