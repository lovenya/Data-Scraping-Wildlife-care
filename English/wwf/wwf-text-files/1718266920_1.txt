1. Include the use of nature for both climate change mitigation and adaptation and prioritize actions that provide benefits for both. 2. Set ambitious, measurable, and numeric time-bound targets (e.g. acres of ecosystems used, CO2 sequestered, and/or the number of people benefiting from increased resilience. 3. To maximize benefits to biodiversity, use natural ecosystems over "artificial" or "modified" ecosystems, and include climate benefits derived from protected areas. 4. Explore all ecosystem types that can provide climate benefits—wetlands, forests, mangroves, coral reefs, grasslands, working lands, urban landscapes. 5. Acknowledge and manage climate risks that threaten the longterm viability of nature-based solutions. 6. Integrate commitments to other international conventions and relevant national policies that result in climate adaptation and mitigation benefits. 7. Ensure adherence to social and environmental safeguards, and include community participation and consultation in the development and management of nature-based climate solutions. 8. Include the need for technical and financial support to achieve results. This guidance was developed as a contribution to the NDC Partnership and made possible by the Support Project for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement , which is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenrarbeit and funded by the German Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety under its International Climate Initiative.
