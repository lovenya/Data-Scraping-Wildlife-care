The halls of Congress came alive on Tuesday as dozens of WWF activists from across the country met with their representatives to advocate for international conservation funding. Through more than 60 face-to-face meetings on Lobby Day 2017, our activists shared with key legislators their concerns and hopes on topics ranging from stopping wildlife trafficking to tackling climate change.

 An unseasonal snow storm barreled up the east coast on the eve of Lobby Day, threatening to disrupt a full day of meetings in Washington, DC. But our activists didn’t bat an eye. Crisscrossing snowy streets from office to office, they shared with their leaders their personal connections to nature and urged them to take action. Building a movement A pair from Texas talked with a legislative correspondent in the office of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) about how illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing impacts jobs in their home state. A group from Florida discussed with Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fl.) the immediate effects of climate change in their neighborhoods, from constant flooding to unusually high tides. And a student from Maryland told Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) what he learned in school about the dangers of wildlife trafficking, and some solutions he and his classmates developed. Alone, their voices matter. Together, they are amplified. “As I walked the halls of Congress yesterday hearing stories of triumph from our activists, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude,” said Sara Thomas, manager of online advocacy at WWF. “Their dedication, determination, and commitment to protecting wildlife and wild places is vital to WWF’s mission. And they’re courageously opening new doors and inspiring all of us.” Join the movement. Become a Panda Ambassador. Join the movement. Become a Panda Ambassador.
