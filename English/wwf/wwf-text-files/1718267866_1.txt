The South Pacific nation of Fiji is made up of over 300 islands that are home to a people who hold strong traditions and a culture highly attuned to nature and the ocean. Fiji's traditions Qoliqoli are large community-controlled fishing areas, a centuries-old Fijian cultural practice that a community fishes within and carefully monitors. Fisheries areas are rotated within a qoliqoli to keep fish populations and food security high. There are 33 qoliqoli
across Fiji’s Great Sea Reef ranging in size from about 28 square miles to 1,300 square miles and their borders run from the coastline across the breadth of the reef. Cokovata, a large area made of several communities’ qoliqoli
off the north coast of Fiji’s second-largest island, encompasses incredible wildlife even by Fiji’s rich biodiversity measure. The shoreline is fringed with mangrove forests and waters with endangered humphead wrasse, bumphead parrotfish, grouper, and sharks. It was declared a Ramsar Site—a wetland of international importance—by the Ramsar Convention in 2018 because of the astounding nature that it holds. Tabu are pockets of fully protected areas within a qoliqoli, where community leaders decree that all fishing and other extractive practices be avoided. These areas vary in size but are around 3.5 square miles on average. WWF has worked with Fijian communities to increase the number of tabu areas within qoliqoli along the Great Sea Reef to give fish, corals, and turtles more sheltered space to grow and thrive out of harm’s way. There are now 18 tabu reserves and protected areas have expanded onto the coast to include four mangrove reserves and five turtle nesting spots. Sustainable Measures
