Using Wildlife Insights to monitor Australian wildlife impacted by bushfires WWF and Conservation International, supported generously by Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org, are launching An Eye on Recovery, one of the most extensive post-fire surveillance programs ever undertaken in Australia. Last summer's Australian bushfires were some of the worst in living memory. A staggering 3 billion animals were estimated to be in the path of the flames. Through this project, WWF, via a network of local partners, will install more than 600 camera traps in bushfire-affected areas across Australia, to monitor and evaluate the surviving wildlife populations. Images captured by the cameras will be analyzed in Wildlife Insights, a groundbreaking cloud platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to identify the animals detected in each photo. Wildlife Insights has been trained to identify more than 700 different species, but this is the first time the platform will be tested on Australia’s unique wildlife. The first cameras have already been installed on Kangaroo Island—half of which was consumed in last year’s fires—to monitor species like the critically endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart. These tiny marsupials are about the size of a mouse, making them very hard to find across a large landscape. Before the bushfires, there was estimated to be fewer than 500 Kangaroo Island dunnarts on the island, and almost all of their habitat was impacted in the burn.
