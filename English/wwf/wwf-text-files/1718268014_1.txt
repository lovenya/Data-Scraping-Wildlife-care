Editor’s Note: This issue of World Wildlife magazine includes a feature devoted to women in conservation.

It definitely gave me pause. The truth is, I was interested in the job because of the love I had for nature—a love that was instilled in me and my siblings by my mother.

She grew up in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and one of the things she loved about scouting was that it allowed her to get out into the natural world—to leave the city and really explore who she was.
