From the Mesopotamian era to the modern age, dams have enabled enormous progress. They’ve helped us generate power, store water for drinking and agriculture, and manage the risk of floods. But choking up the world’s rivers and streams has had major consequences for biodiversity and people. Now many experts agree: Some dams have run their course. Rivers around the world have been fragmented by dams, weirs, and other barriers. These obstacles can alter water quality, threaten habitats, and disrupt the flow of nutrients, sediments, and species, impacting freshwater ecosystems and important fisheries. Dam removals are an effective tool for bringing obstructed rivers back to life. By restoring a river’s flow, removing dams can encourage the recovery of freshwater species and habitats, providing lasting benefits for nature and communities. While dams provide myriad benefits, they must be sustainably managed to meet peoples’ needs while maintaining river health. WWF advocates for removing harmful dams and preventing the constructIon of poorly designed ones, and promotes low-cost energy sources like solar and wind. The dam removal trend is picking up steam, helping to revitalize thousands of miles of waterways: A record-setting 325 river barriers were removed from 16 European countries in 2022, while 65 were removed in the US. Parts of Asia, Oceania, and South Africa are also starting to follow suit. View all issues h
