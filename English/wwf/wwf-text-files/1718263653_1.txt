On Halloween, we’re all searching through our clothing for the perfect black and orange outfit in honor of the holiday. Some animals in the wild already sport the colors. From swimming the seas to flying through the skies, these creatures don Halloween fashion all year round.

Take a look at a few of these critters. Monarch Butterfly
Not only are monarch butterflies beautiful, but they also travel incredible distances to get here. These butterflies migrate up to 2,800 miles from the United States and Canada to central Mexican forest. These vital pollinators hibernate in the mountains where a milder climate makes it easier for them to survive. Climate change means monarchs have less food. WWF works on climate-smart conservation in an effort to save butterflies and other species. Monarch Butterfly Emperor Penguin
Emperor penguins are hefty. The giants of the penguins, they can grow up to four feet tall and weigh up to 80 pounds. They find their stride in the water, where they dive deep for prey and stay underwater longer than other penguins. Climate change and habitat loss pose risks for these amazing birds. Emperor Penguin Tiger
Tigers are the most iconic of the big cats. The stripes they sport are more than just decorative; each tiger has a unique pattern that identifies them as an individual. WWF scientists rely on these markings when counting various populations. Tiger Puffin
Puffins bop around coastlines all over the world, from Alaska to northern Asia. Their pointed wings help them glide through water with ease, making hunting for fish, squid and crustaceans much easier. Puffins spend most of their lives at sea and return to shore to breed. Puffin Clown Fish
Clown fish are bright, small swimmers in the Pacific and Indian oceans. They maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with sea anemones—a protective coating makes them immune to the stinging tentacles. Clown fish feed off the debris created by sea anemones. Clown Fish
