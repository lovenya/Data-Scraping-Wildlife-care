Keeping ivory where it belongs To protect elephants, rhinos, tigers and other species, WWF is leading a global campaign to stop wildlife crime. We are backing rangers in protected areas who are increasingly vulnerable to organized wildlife crime. We are advocating to make sure laws against poaching and trafficking are implemented—and prosecuted—to their fullest extent. Through TRAFFIC, we are monitoring and analyzing trade routes and transfer points to take away both supply and demand. In the past year, we also mobilized 1.6 million people to successfully urge the Thai Prime Minister to ban ivory trade in her country. We helped engage high-level champions, including former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and US President Barack Obama, in the cause. We audited Gabon’s stockpile of seized ivory and supported its destruction to send a strong message of zero tolerance for poaching. With Google, we are testing new technologies to help rangers stay ahead of the poachers. And alongside faith leaders from around the world we are calling on the faithful of many religions to reject ivory and other illegal wildlife products and parts.
