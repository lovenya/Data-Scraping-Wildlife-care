When that ball drops, we all start thinking, how can I be a little better this year? Many of us go straight to food resolutions: eating healthier, joining a gym, dropping a few pounds. How about a food resolution that will protect the planet and your wallet? Why not put your food waste on a diet? Around the world, a third of the food we grow and process to feed people never reaches our plates (or our bellies). That has serious impacts on the planet's water, energy, and wildlife!  Just think about it: if we make better use of the food already out there, we wouldn’t need to produce so much—and we could protect more habitats and feed more hungry people. Plus, it’s the gift that keeps on giving—it will save you money! The average family of four loses between $1,365 to $2,275 each year on wasted food. Try exercising these tips to drop those food waste pounds: If one of your resolutions this year is to protect the planet or conserve wildlife, this is one simple way you can take action. And even if you already consider yourself a food waste warrior, there’s always room for improvement. It's never the wrong time of year to resolve to cut your food waste.
