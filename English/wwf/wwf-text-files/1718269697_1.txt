Colivoro’s community, Fundo Yaldad Mon Fen, began organizing in 2016. They studied Chile’s Ley Lafkenche, a unique law made by and for Indigenous communities that provides the framework for them to become legal guardians of the coastal environments they inhabit. Protests led by Colivoro’s lonko, Cristian Chiguay, segued into a larger community organizing effort. Following several open-door meetings, nine neighboring lonkos signed on for the ECMPO initiative (see the list at right), and the Wafo Wapi partnership was born. Since Ley Lafkenche came into effect in 2008, only 18 ECMPOs have passed the state’s rigorous six-step application process, but if all goes to plan, Wafo Wapi could create one of the largest ECMPOs ever (870 square miles, including Guafo and great stretches of ocean) by the end of 2023. All of this makes Wafo Wapi and the collaborative effort to protect Guafo and its waters even more special. Wafo Wapi has the support of artisanal fishers like Vidal, who, in return, still have access to the island. “The sea has been overexploited,” Vidal explains, “so it’s clear you have to protect it.” “It would be great for our kids and grandkids to know one day that there were people who were worried about protecting this place,” says Chiguay, basket of lapas in hand, watching as the birds nearly blacken out the sunset in the skies overhead. “That there were people who, with little formal knowledge, tried to care for the environment for future generations.” For now, a squat white Navy lighthouse on the cliff in the distance is the only sign of human intervention—other than five bold-colored fishing boats in the bay, which have moored together to form a floating city of sailors. Men onboard pass around gourds of hot yerba mate (an energizing tea). They cook stews atop wood-burning stoves, ready their mattresses, and prepare for the long cool of night. View all issues h
