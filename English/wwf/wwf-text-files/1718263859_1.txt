In Shawn Smith's sculptures, our digital world and nature collide: "I am interested in how we experience nature through technology," he says. "I grew up in a large city, connecting with the natural world through computers and TV. With my work, I create three-dimensional sculptural representations of two-dimensional images of nature I find online." He meticulously assembles cut and dyed wood, he says, to directly contrast with "the slipperiness and speed of the digital world." See more images at shawnsmithart.com. View all issues h
