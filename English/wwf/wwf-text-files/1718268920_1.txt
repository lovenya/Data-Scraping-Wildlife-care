The small acoustic device, about the size of a banana, is attached to a gillnet and emits a pulsing noise that annoys the dolphins but doesn’t harm them. Dolphins steer clear of the nets, deterred from trying to snatch fish from them, and can therefore feed and swim more safely in their habitat. Fishers’ nets, meanwhile, sustain less damage. Pingers benefit both dolphins and fishers’ livelihoods. A six-month study led by conservation organization Yayasan Konservasi RASI and supported by WWF recently revealed that fishers who used the devices saw a 40% increase in their daily catch—an additional 350 to 500 pounds of fish—and tended to catch larger fish, increasing their profits. 80 Approximate number of Irrawaddy dolphins that live in the Mahakam River. Small populations are also found in the Mekong and Ayeyarwady rivers, where, in addition to entanglement, they’re impacted by habitat degradation, unsustainable fishing practices, and water pollution. 100% Reduction in dolphin bycatch during the study—and the percentage of participating fishers who kept using the devices after the trial ended.
