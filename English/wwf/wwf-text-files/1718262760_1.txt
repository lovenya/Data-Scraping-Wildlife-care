As evidence grew that the rhinos of the world were under renewed assault for their horns, special agents of the US Fish and Wildlife law enforcement division noted a corresponding spike in horn smuggling in the United States. Recruiting some 150 law enforcement officers to the case, they began an undercover investigation—called Operation Crash—to infiltrate and crack the crime ring. In February 2012, they swooped in for the first of an ongoing series of takedowns that has since netted 15 arrests and seven convictions in 13 states, along with millions of dollars’ worth of illegal horns, cash, cars and jewels. The busts have highlighted both the global allure of wildlife crime and the role of the US as an international transit hub.
