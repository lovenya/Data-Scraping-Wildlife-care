It’s mid-afternoon in the small, but mighty Himalayan country of Nepal, and actor Nicholas Hoult gets a wet kiss from an orphaned, baby rhino. Nepal’s National Trust for Nature Conservation found the stray, who is now in their care. Hoult recently traveled to Chitwan National Park in Nepal to learn about Nepal’s and WWF’s conservation efforts to protect little “Mayure” and the other greater one-horned rhinos that are threatened by poaching and habitat loss, among other dangers. “Wildlife conservation is so important,” said Hoult. “A lot of these animals are being poached illegally, their numbers are dwindling, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. Rhinos in particular I’ve adored since I was three years old and was lucky enough to go on holiday to Africa. I didn’t see a rhino at that age, but I was given a little wooden carving of a rhino which I still own to this day, I’ve loved rhinos ever since that moment. To come out here and see them in their natural habitat is such a great pleasure and I can’t thank WWF enough for the wonderful work they do in helping this park and the Nepal government develop their programs and keep rhinos in the wild.”
