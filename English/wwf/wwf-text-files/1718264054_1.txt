Stopping wildlife crime requires stepping into a supply and demand scenario of nightmarish dimensions. On the supply side, shutting down poaching and the international criminal cartels that drive it is absolutely vital. On the demand side, staunching consumer desire for ivory and other illegal and unsustainable wildlife products is equally essential. "Americans have the ability to stem the horrific environmental, economic, and safety effects of wildlife poaching if they simply don’t buy ivory. We can’t point the finger unless we clean up our own act." "The halving of ivory prices in China is a vital first step in ending Africa’s ivory crisis. Though there is much work to be done, this is good news for Africa’s elephants, and the Chinese government should be credited for this progress. There’s light at the end of the tunnel for elephants, instead of extinction." "One live elephant is worth so much more than all the pieces of art made from ivory [that are] gathering dust in homes far removed from the African plains." "Time is running out for elephants. The grim reality is that until superpowers like the US and China close their commercial ivory markets, and freshly poached ivory can no longer masquerade as something it’s not, the blood of Africa’s elephants will continue to stain our collective hands." "We are part of the problem, and we want to be part of the solution." "I ... hope that people stop treating elephants and other species as a tool or a problem but become their friends, and let them live freely in their natural environment."
