At A Turning Point for the Amazon, the Thomas Lovejoy Science for Nature Symposium, we'll discuss the Amazon's resilience to threats and disturbances and solutions to keep the Amazon and its people thriving. The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous people occupy an island of rain forest surrounded by farms in the Brazilian state of Rondônia. Their territory is one of the most important in the region, valued for its rich biodiversity and freshwater sources. Since the 1980s, however, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau have faced successive invasions by loggers, farmers, and land-grabbers. With deforestation in the Amazon at its highest rate in more than 15 years, their livelihoods and culture are at risk.

To illegally clear land in the Amazon, invaders often burn the forest, leading to wildfires. In the wake of the devastating Amazon wildfires of 2019, WWF collaborated with the Kanindé Association of Ethno-Environmental Protection to supply the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau with terrestrial monitoring equipment—including drones, smartphones, and camera traps—and field training to document illegal deforestation. The drones create high-resolution images, video, and GPS mapping data that allow the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau to discover and record deforestation while avoiding unexpected and potentially deadly confrontations with illegal loggers and land-grabbers.

The tools and training were provided to other Indigenous peoples and territories with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The grant also allowed WWF to customize software, the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART), to meet the communities' monitoring needs.
