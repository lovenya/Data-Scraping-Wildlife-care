WWF president and CEO Carter Roberts sits down to talk with Dr. Rajiv Shah, president of The Rockefeller Foundation, about finding big solutions to big problems. CARTER ROBERTS Hi, there. So nice to see you again. RAJ SHAH Thanks for the invitation. CR We’ve talked before about the nature of solutions and how to get after the biggest problems facing the world. Can you reflect on things you’ve done that epitomize how you think we should approach this work? RS When I started working with Bill Gates almost 20 years ago, we were looking at how to get more children immunized. So we pulled all the top thinkers together and asked what it would take to go from a global immunization rate of 40% to as close to 100% as we could get. These conversations led to the creation of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, and over 18 years we got the immunization rate to the mid 80s [percentage]. That translates to almost 600 million children immunized and more than 6 million child lives saved. View all issues h
