The Ubbens’ gift is a powerful shot in the arm for WWF’s work, including efforts to end the illegal ivory trade—particularly in Asia, which is home to most of the world’s ivory markets. Illegal ivory traders often use legal ivory markets as cover for their criminal activity. That is why January 1, 2018, the day China closed its legal ivory market (the largest in the world), was such a turning point. And momentum is growing: Just one month later, Hong Kong announced that it will shutter its market by 2021. These actions represent a major blow to ivory traffickers, but even the strictest bans won’t completely stop the illegal ivory trade, so long as demand for the “white gold” remains. To learn what drives people to purchase ivory, and what might persuade them to stop, WWF and TRAFFIC commissioned the largest survey ever done of Chinese ivory consumers—funded in part by Jeff and Laurie’s gift. According to this survey, most Chinese consumers intend to abide by the government’s new ban on ivory. The survey also provided key insights on how to persuade the remaining holdouts—insights that are already shaping WWF’s new consumer engagement strategy. The Ubbens’ gift will help drive this crucial effort to change hearts and minds, even as WWF also works with governments and other conservation groups to shut down the remaining legal ivory markets throughout Asia.
