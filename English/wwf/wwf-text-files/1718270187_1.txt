With dry grass and fire sticks, men build the fires used for warmth, protection, and an ideal place to share stories. Around the crackling flames, tales reference nature and show their unbreakable bond to their environment. These stories are told to remind the young ones where they come from—the earth—and why it is important to safeguard nature’s gift and nurture the land that sustains them. Being in the open allows creativity to flourish. A father makes toys for the village children using a bird’s feather, rope, sticks, and a small stone to crate the helicopter toy. As it is thrown upwards and dances in the air, it’s a testament to both imagination and skill, capturing the wonders that nature can create. In Nyae Nyae, nature is more than a provider; it is an integral part of the community. The San people value this relationship and tend to it with reverence, knowing that in the circle of life, nature plays its part in caring for them, just as they care for nature. From the Baobab trees that stand tall, to the stories that warm the night air, this is a place where nature's heartbeat resonates in every breath.
