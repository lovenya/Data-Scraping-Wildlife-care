Heritage Colombia is a conservation financing project designed to secure protections for Colombia’s natural and cultural landscapes; it will help complete a suite of long-term funding efforts that will collectively, permanently protect 14% of the Amazon.

But Heritage Colombia goes far beyond the Amazon. In fact, it is the astounding diversity of landscapes included in the project that makes it unique. Heritage Colombia includes the dense forests and fast-flowing rivers of the Amazon, the white-capped mountains of the Andes, mangroves along the Pacific Coast, vast stretches of the Caribbean Sea, the open savanna of the Orinoco River basin—and some of the greatest biological diversity on the planet. In fact, per square kilometer, the country is the most biodiverse. There are more bird, amphibian, butterfly, and frog species here than anywhere else in the world.
