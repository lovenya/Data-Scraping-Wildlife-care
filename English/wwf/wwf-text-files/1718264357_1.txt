In the 19 years he has been working in conservation, 44-year-old Tenzin can readily identify the most challenging work he has tackled yet in Bhutan. “It was definitely the snow leopard survey work we conducted in Wangchuck Centennial National Park,” he said. “We had to survey remote, unpopulated areas over long periods of time, and become familiar with a lot of new research tools.” Bhutan’s pristine mountains are an important home to the charismatic snow leopard. However, Tenzin, the Head of Research in Wangchuck Centennial National Park (WCNP), had yet to see evidence of one in the park until WCNP’s first ever population survey of snow leopards was conducted as part of the WWF Asia High Mountains Project, supported by USAID. The survey took place over three years, and Tenzin vividly remembers the first time they retrieved the automatic cameras set up as part of the survey. They were amazed to find that they had the first photographs of the elusive snow leopard from WCNP. The stuff of legends and anecdotes was now captured as digital images.
