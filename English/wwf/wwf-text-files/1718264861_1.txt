California is a global winemaking powerhouse. But extreme weather—from droughts to floods, all driven by climate change—could threaten that productivity. With properly timed precipitation key to a great vintage, “good wine years” may grow increasingly uncertain. In 2015, California pumped out 638 million gallons—85% of all wine produced in the US. In the global market, the state might as well be a country: Only France, Italy, and Spain produce more wine. In 2015, California pumped out 638 million gallons—85% of all wine produced in the US Climate scientists predict more major droughts, higher temperatures, and erratic weather patterns in California in the years to come. The state’s wine industry is currently stable, and some vineyards are actually flourishing in response to higher temperatures. But if current trends continue, California’s vineyards could become more heavily dependent on water from irrigation, putting increased pressure on precious water supplies. putting increased pressure on precious water supplies Estimated amount of water needed to produce a gallon of California wine. water needed to produce a gallon of California wine Grapes are now the state’s third-biggest cash crop, second only to milk and almonds.
