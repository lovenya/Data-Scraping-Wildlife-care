Earlier this month, WWF conservationists in South Africa were surprised and delighted to discover a new addition among a population of recently relocated black rhinos. A baby rhino calf was spotted alongside its mother just months after the female was moved—along with 13 other rhinos—by WWF’s Black Rhino Range Expansion Project (BRREP) from the province of KwaZulu-Natal to a new location in the north of the country. BRREP is an initiative that has been working since 2003 to bolster and increase black rhino numbers in South Africa. Since its launch, the project has been at the helm of efforts to establish new populations of black rhinos using translocation—a process that involves capturing small groups of rhinos from healthy populations then releasing them in new sites where they have the space and resources they need to breed. The newborn rhino is an exciting indication that the project’s hard work is paying off, and that the rhinos moved as part of the latest translocation—completed in October 2017—are thriving in their new environment. As further proof of BRREP’s success, some of the rhinos involved in the move were offspring from earlier project sites. There are about 90 surviving calves that have been born on BRREP sites, and about 200  black rhinos living in BRREP sites across South Africa —roughly 10% of the country’s black rhino population.
