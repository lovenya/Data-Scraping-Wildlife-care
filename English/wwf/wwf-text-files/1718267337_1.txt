Growing enough food to feed the worldâ€™s population comes with an environmental price tag. Traditional farming practices can use too much water, cause deforestation and soil erosion, and lead to pesticide overuse. So how do we feed people sustainably?

Exposed plant roots are misted with nutrient-rich water in this offshoot of hydroponics. Here, fish tanks are hooked into hydroponics systems, with the waste generated by aquatic animals nourishing the plants. View all issues h
