In collaboration with ANOMALY gallery, Japanese artist Yusuke Asai crafts his murals from an unlikely medium: soil. To create his installations, Asai works with the local community, gathering dirt from familiar and sacred spaces, drying it, sifting out rocks and pebbles, and transforming it into art. Asai doesn’t sketch or plan ahead. Instead, the piece is discovered in the act of creation: “Soils have their own eagerness to change texture and transform into the shape of what they want to be,” he says. For Asai, “nature is the best teacher.” “YUSUKE ASAI: SEEDS OF IMAGINATION, JOURNEY OF SOIL” 2015, THE HAKONE OPEN-AIR MUSEUM, TOKYO, JAPAN “YUSUKE ASAI: SEEDS OF IMAGINATION, JOURNEY OF SOIL” View all issues h
