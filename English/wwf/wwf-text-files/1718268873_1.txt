Conservation can be a very personal endeavor: A single experience or situation can define what we choose to care about and ultimately work to save. When Luis Alberto Moreno was growing up in Colombia, his parents (especially his mother, he says) made sure he spent a lot of time outdoors. “I got that love of being out in nature at a very young age, and it’s stayed with me,” he says. “I remember seeing rivers and animals and birds, which is something that Colombia has in huge abundance.” Later in life, when Moreno became Colombia’s minister of economic development, the process of truly understanding Colombia’s natural resources and the risks they faced—his conservation journey—began in earnest. One of the first things he did as minister was come to Washington in 1992 to meet with environmentalists and conservation groups, including WWF. It was during this meeting that Moreno met Tom Lovejoy, the first scientist hired at WWF-US, who would go on to become an internationally esteemed ecologist as well as something of an informal environmental advisor to Moreno.
