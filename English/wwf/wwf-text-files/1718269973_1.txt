World leaders will meet in Dubai to address the climate crisis. Dec. 13, 2023
In a significant moment for global climate action, countries at the COP28 UN climate summit have agreed to transition away from fossil fuels, but fail to commit to a full phase-out. Dec. 13, 2023 “The Earth is down but not out, as countries agree to transition away from fossil fuels but fall short of consensus on the full phase-out of coal, oil, and gas at COP28," said Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF global climate and energy lead, and COP20 president. "Nevertheless, a decision to transition away from fossil fuels is a significant moment. After three decades of UN climate negotiations, countries have at last shifted the focus to the polluting fossil fuels driving the climate crisis. This outcome signals the beginning of the end for the fossil fuel era." Read the full press release. What is COP28? Will governments commit to phasing out fossil fuels at COP28?
