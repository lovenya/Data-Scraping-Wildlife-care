The percentage of Turkey’s hazelnuts that are grown in the Black Sea region, where climate change has recently caused heat waves, shifting rain patterns, and severe storms, leading to declines in crop yields and affecting thousands of livelihoods. the Black Sea region Demand for hazelnuts is climbing, but production is slowing due to aging orchards, soil loss, and poor farming practices—a worrisome trend for consumers and confectionary brands that rely on the ingredient. There’s hope ahead for hazelnuts: Along the US East Coast, where conditions are ripe for growing the crop, scientists are experimenting with new hybrid trees resistant to Eastern filbert blight, a fungus that has long hampered hazelnut cultivation in the US. Since 2015, WWF-Turkey has worked with multinational cookie and cracker manufacturer Ülker Bisküvi—one of the largest hazelnut buyers in the country—on the Sustainable Hazelnut Farming Project, an initiative focused on improving agricultural practices and protecting biodiversity where hazelnuts are grown. Hazelnut trees make ideal crops. These perennials can thrive despite tough soil, drought, and other harsh growing conditions, and they require no pesticides. They also sequester more carbon than annual crops, reduce soil erosion, and filter pollutants from groundwater. View all issues h
