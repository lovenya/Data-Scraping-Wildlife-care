Clara Pratte was raised on the Navajo Nation, and her earliest memories of nature are being outside at her grandmother’s house there—“sitting under the pine trees with my aunts and my grandma, picking up the little pinyons (pine nuts) that had fallen and harvesting wild carrots and onions.” Her grandmother taught her that when they took something from the ground—vegetables, herbs, flowers—they had to replenish or recultivate the resource. “And we only took what we needed—just enough to sustain us,” Pratte says. “We always had a sense of how important it was to take care of the environment and use natural resources responsibly. That was something we learned at a very young age.” This belief system informed Pratte’s views not only about nature, but also about economic development and energy development, areas of interest she would end up pursuing professionally: “How do we balance the need for development without upsetting ecosystems? And how do we do it in a more sustainable and mindful way?” Pratte has remained committed to finding that balance for her community. She has served as the chief of staff for the Navajo Nation and as executive director of the Navajo Nation’s Washington, DC, office, among other professional achievements, focusing on poverty alleviation, economic empowerment, and advancing tribal sovereignty.
