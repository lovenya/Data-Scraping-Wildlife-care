When Bill Reilly’s father worked on ships as a young man, he developed a romance with the sea. During family vacations in Massachusetts, Bill and his dad would often take the ferry from Newport to Jamestown, just to stare at the waves. And though he ultimately became a land-use policy professional, his love for the water has never wavered. When Reilly moved with his family to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas at age 10, he came to appreciate water in a whole new way. He had friends who lived in what are now known as colonias—rural settlements that typically have no infrastructure to deliver fresh water or handle wastewater and sewage. He witnessed firsthand the health risks and other challenges that came with a lack of access to clean water. It was a lesson that stayed with him. “When I was at EPA, I put a lot of money into the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico. That was important to me. And one of my proudest achievements at EPA was helping secure an annual $50 million for colonias in the last [President George H. W.] Bush budget.” Because Reilly has been at the nexus of the American conservation movement for more than four decades, he has been on the front lines of a remarkable transformation in the practice of the discipline.
