Sometimes the pursuit of a goal produces advantageous byproducts. When the government of Namibia, WWF, and other partners launched Namibia’s pioneering communal conservancy program in 1998, the primary intention was to restore wildlife populations and generate nature-based revenue and jobs for local people. The conservancies—there are now 82 covering almost 20% of the country—have achieved success in their original aims. They now produce more than US$8 million a year in direct cash income and in-kind benefits for communities. Namibia’s elephant population has more than tripled, black rhinos have rebounded from near extinction, and freeroaming desert lions—reduced to fewer than 25 by the mid-1990s—now number over 150 and inhabit vast expanses of the country’s arid northwest. In the process, conservancies have also given rise to a robust network of local leadership committees that manage conservancy land, regularly interface with the government, and meet consistently to address community issues. Its leaders are democratically elected. While not an explicit goal of the program, the creation of this interlinked grassroots network—relatively unique in rural Africa—has proved highly valuable in its own right. View all issues h
