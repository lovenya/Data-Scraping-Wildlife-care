Thanks to generous WWF supporters, we reached our fundraising goal! Bolstered by a crucial $250,000 matching commitment from an anonymous donor, the fundraiser brought in $442,000 from more than 2,400 people within weeks. With additional support from a second anonymous donor, we reached our campaign target of $500,000. The funding will help the Namibian governmentâ€™s urgent antipoaching plan in Etosha, including training a sniffer dog unit to track poachers, building housing for the Wildlife Protection Service, and establishing a horse patrol unit to help rangers monitor the park's remote areas.
