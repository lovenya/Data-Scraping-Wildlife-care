Father’s Day fell during this intense period. I took a break from our negotiations to send my children a quick note that read, “On this Father’s Day, I want you all to know how proud I am of you. Lots of love, Dad.” Unfortunately, in haste, I sent it to the Herencia Colombia WhatsApp group—not to my kids. One of my colleagues responded to everyone, in Spanish, “Don’t worry, Papa Carter, we love you, too.” Once all the final conditions were met, we signed the papers officially launching Herencia Colombia during a ceremony at the Colombian presidential palace. During the ceremony, President Duque and Minister Correa took time to thank the many people who had worked so hard to make the day possible—including “Papa Carter,” which elicited peals of laughter from the crowd. Some 30 years ago, I worked to put together a conservation deal in Martha’s Vineyard. I had many conversations with Jerry Kohlberg—one of the founders of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. He turned to me at one point and asked, “How much goodwill is there between you and the people with whom you work? Because at some point, something will go wrong. But if you have that abiding goodwill, you will surely find your way through anything.” I tell these stories to illustrate the fundamental truth that relationships matter. They are a necessary ingredient in our work—and in my mind, the greatest joy in all that we do. President & CEO View all issues h
