The greatest truth about conservation is that the work is never done. WWF has always understood that conservation is a constant work in progress, full of complexities and dualities, much like the nature we seek to save. And so our efforts must always be focused, inclusive, nimble, and designed to endure. We have recently been reminded of the profound importance of two things as inputs into our work: the best available science and the wisdom of communities in designing solutions. We must always be questioning and testing our hypotheses about the tools we use, and measuring them against the difference they’re making in saving the natural world and improving people’s lives. By the same token, we know we need to ensure that communities have a seat at the table in designing, implementing, and evaluating this work. The conservation initiatives that last will be those that benefit communities, are owned by communities, and are supported by partners and governments as well. Carter Roberts
