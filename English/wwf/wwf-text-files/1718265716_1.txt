The leopard doesn’t seem to notice. Neither does the family of elephants, nor the grazing tapir. But in the dense forests of Kui Buri National Park, located in Thailand’s Tenasserim Hills, a hidden camera trap is busy snapping photos of each animal that passes by. Camera traps are just like regular cameras, except they’re triggered by infrared sensors to take photos or videos whenever they sense movement. In recent years, researchers at WWF-Thailand have been using these specially adapted devices throughout Kui Buri to capture images of various species on film, which helps them to determine which animals—and how many—are present in the region. They also allow scientists to track and monitor wildlife movement.
