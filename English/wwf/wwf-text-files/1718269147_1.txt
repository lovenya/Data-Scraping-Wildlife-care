How creative solutions are making honey collection a less dangerous way of life Based on reporting by KASSIA WORDLEY and TANMOY BHADURI. Crouching down, a mouli (Bengali for “honey collector”) checks a beehive frame in an apiary belonging to the Bonphool Honey Collective in India. The air around him hums as bees buzz through the rows of apiary boxes; he vents a puff of smoke from a tin can to calm them while he works. Four years ago, moulis working with the collective might have been standing knee-deep in mud in a dense mangrove forest—a bastion for tigers—instead of this safe spot near a mustard field. Traditionally, moulis have harvested honey from wild beehives deep in the Sundarbans, a coastal mangrove forest stretching from southern Bangladesh to West Bengal in India. But communities in the region are seeking to establish safer practices, away from tiger territory. Although tigers have been known to leave the mangroves in search of prey—and both people and tigers have been killed as a result—honey collecting in the tiger’s mangrove habitat is the greater risk. So, in 2018, WWF-India partnered with the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve Directorate to supply apiary boxes to licensed local honey collectors in the Sundarbans, with the hopes of generating livelihoods and minimizing human-tiger conflict. Since then, honey collectors consistently harvesting from these enclosed areas have not experienced human-tiger conflict, and honey production has increased. View all issues h
