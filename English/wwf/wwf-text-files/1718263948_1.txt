When scientist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond was 42, he received a once-in-a-lifetime offer: Would he like to design a country’s national park system? Of course, there was a slight catch: He had one month to complete the project, and the budget was only $1,000. The country seeking Diamond’s assistance was Indonesian New Guinea, a place he knew well. Diamond wrote a renowned study of the ecology and distribution of its birds, and has returned to the country a dozen times over the years. “[The park planning] was an assignment of the sort that conservationists dream about, but that I think will never again happen,” he says. Perhaps even more amazing, the recommendations that Diamond handed to Indonesian officials nearly four decades ago were implemented with few changes and remain, for the most part, in place today.
