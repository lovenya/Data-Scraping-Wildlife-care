Noises, whether the creak of a door or the whistle of the wind, are perfect ways to settle into spooky season. In an increasingly noisy world, these classic wildlife sounds can certainly serve as seasonal fodder for Halloween, but they can also bring us comfort. We share the world with an amazing array of wildlife and the cacophony of sounds they make. So settle in for a playlist that's a bit frightening. But ultimately, we know that the world would be a lot scarier without wildlife.
