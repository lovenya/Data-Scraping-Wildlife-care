In October 2016, Asser Ndjitezeua traveled from his home in Namibia to Washington, DC, to participate in a panel on community conservation as part of the annual meeting of WWF’s Board of Directors and National Council. Afterward, he and Carter Roberts talked about community conservancies, tough love, and the importance of finding your passion. CARTER ROBERTS You are a central part of the community conservancy story in Namibia, and I’d love for you to share that story with us. How did community conservancies get started in Namibia? CARTER ROBERTS ASSER NDJITEZEUA The whole Community-Based Natural Resource Management program, or CBNRM, started after the independence of Namibia in 1990. The government realized that before independence only private landowners had benefited from the country’s natural resources. They changed that legislation so that rural communities and people farming on community land could also benefit from the natural resources, including wildlife, effectively creating incentives to look after the wildlife. So our community decided we wanted to establish a communal conservancy. Our conservancy was established under the auspices of the Farmers Association [Grootberg Farmers Union] and I have been the secretary of the Farmers Association for many years. So I was part of the team driving the process. ASSER NDJITEZEUA But apart from that, I was born in a rural area and I grew up as a rural boy. So I had tremendous love for nature already, and when this legislation was passed, it just suited me. I love nature very much and it was just in my scope of life. View all issues h
