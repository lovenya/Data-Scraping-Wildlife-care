A successful trial of an atmospheric cooling system for flying foxes in Australia has given hope to researchers working to prevent the vulnerable species from dying and suffering in the country’s extreme heat. The innovative cooling system was installed in January in Bendigo’s Rosalind Park, which is home to an important breeding colony of grey-headed flying foxes. Jointly funded by WWF-Australia, the city of Greater Bendigo, and the Australian Department of Land, Water, Environment and Planning, the system comprises a series of aerial sprinklers in the tree canopy that distribute rain-like droplets on extremely hot days. “I often go to flying fox camps after a heat event and the scene is quite confronting. I’m meant to be an objective ecologist, but when you see thousands of dead bats lying on the ground it’s impossible to be unaffected.” While the cooling system requires further testing, Dr. van der Ree said he hoped it could be replicated at other sites to protect flying fox colonies. WWF-Australia’s Threatened Species & Climate Adaptation Ecologist, Dr. Kita Ashman said flying foxes were a polarizing but important species. “Australia has a love-hate relationship with flying foxes, but without them, many of our forests and woodlands would not be the same. They help to disperse seeds and pollinate our flowering plants, so we need to think outside the box to protect them from heat events,” said Dr. Ashman.
