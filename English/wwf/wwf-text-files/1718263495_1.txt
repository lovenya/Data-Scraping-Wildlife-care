Plans to drill in Chukchi Sea, home to polar bears, beluga and bowhead whales The US government has approved an application from Royal Dutch Shell to conduct exploratory drilling for oil in Americaâ€™s Arctic ocean. Shell still needs to receive other permits in order to go forward, but is planning to drill this summer in the Chukchi Sea, which is home to polar bears, walrus, beluga and bowhead whales, and diverse seabird populations. WWF strongly opposed this decision and over the past several months has shared voices of concern with the government from more than 100,000 supporters. The drilling site is 70 miles from the shore of Alaska, and 1000 miles away from the nearest US Coast Guard station. In the event of an accident, detecting and containing spilled oil in broken ice, summer fog, and rough sea conditions, would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. With Arctic temperatures rising twice as fast than ever before, and sea ice and snow melting at record levels, it is clear we must act to cut carbon emissions and decrease dependency on fossil fuels. Where oil drilling still occurs, it must be done sustainably and with solid, proven plans for responding to spills. This decision to allow drilling in the Chukchi Sea falls short on all counts. Determinations of where to permit drilling need to be backed by the best science and most advanced stewardship practices, so that critical ecosystems like the Chukchi will remain intact for the people and wildlife who depend on them.
