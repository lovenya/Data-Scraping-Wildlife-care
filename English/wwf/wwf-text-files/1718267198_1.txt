Water is an essential resource that many of us take for granted. It is especially crucial in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it allows basic and fundamental actions to prevent the virus spread: constant sanitation and hand-washing practices. Now, two communities in Northern Honduras have access to this key resource. Because of old and poorly-planned infrastructure, the people of the Laguna de Ba√±aderos and Santa Elena, two communities in the Manchaguala river basin at the Merendon Reserve Zone in Northern Honduras, did not have access to safe drinking water in their homes, despite there being plenty of available water sources in the surrounding environment.
