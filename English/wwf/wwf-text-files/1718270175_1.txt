The human-caused climate crisis is one of the biggest threats to life on Earth. Our planet is rapidly warming, resulting in melting sea ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent and intense weather events, among other alarming impacts. Fortunately, there's a lot we can do to change course—and some surprising sources are already responsible for moving us in the right direction. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency are critical. However, more and more research shows that wildlife and habitat conservation is an integral component that deserves a place in climate action discussions. We're here to introduce you to a few climate heroes—from wildlife to plant life—that naturally help combat the effects of the climate crisis.
