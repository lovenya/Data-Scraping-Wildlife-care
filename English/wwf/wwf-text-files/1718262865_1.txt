On February 28, 2014, WWF President and CEO Carter Roberts sat down with Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton to talk about women and conservation, how she became an environmentalist at the tender age of seven and the importance of a big tent. CARTER ROBERTS: Thank you so much for doing this. It’s great to see you again. So tell me: How did you come to love elephants? CARTER ROBERTS: CHELSEA CLINTON: In a couple of ways. In 1987 my mother’s parents retired and moved from Chicago to Little Rock. And when they arrived, my grandmother said, “We want to give you a present—something you’ll really care about and be connected to.” So I asked for a Greenpeace membership. And then the next year I joined WWF. I don’t really know why a little girl in Arkansas felt so deeply connected to what was happening in the larger world, particularly through what was happening to animals. Certainly we had a fantastic zoo, and my parents did a wonderful job of taking me there when I was little and helping me feel connected to the broader world—but we didn’t have a lot of wildlife where I lived and we weren’t exactly on the oceans. So I’m not sure precisely what the connection was, but animal conservation and then anything related to preserving our planet were what resonated with me most. CHELSEA CLINTON: CR: And what about wildlife trade—when did that become
