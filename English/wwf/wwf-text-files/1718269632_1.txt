My team works closely with our Policy and Government Affairs team because many of the key decision-makers we’re trying to influence are government officials. Some may believe the misconception that because we’re a conservation organization we only work with people who hold certain political ideologies, but that’s not true. As a nonpartisan organization, WWF works with partners and champions across the political spectrum. As politicized as some topics have become, addressing critical conservation issues still requires engaging a diversity of voices and perspectives. We’d be much less effective if we only looked to one side of the aisle. Activism often focuses on getting high turnouts to events or submitting as many petition signatures as possible because those are tangible ways to showcase mass support. They have proved successful in influencing outcomes, especially when paired with personal connections to environmental issues. We also focus on educating the public about why WWF supports certain solutions and how individual voices can collectively impact decision-makers. And maybe most important, we try to amplify and make a space for people who haven’t previously been included in the conversation. All this comes together to allow people to be part of the solution—and part of something bigger than themselves. View all issues h
