Over the past 25 years, we’ve witnessed a significant shift in how we approach animal-sourced food, revealing unexpected trends on our plates. Our growing global appetite for meat, milk, and eggs raises urgent concerns about agriculture's environmental impact on our planet. In a recent WWF publication, we highlight four solutions to transform how we produce animal feed to protect people and nature: The approach aims to reduce agriculture’s negative impacts on the planet by holding unsustainable food systems accountable and acknowledging the need for scaled action. We must also point out the successful examples of sustainable systems already in place in the world. Embracing circular ingredients means adopting a smart approach that transforms the way we handle food, elevating what was once seen as waste into a higher-value ingredient by either repurposing or preventing it. The goal is to stop the unnecessary loss of resources and add value to what we have1,2. For example, without forethought, grains leftover after brewing a vat of beer are seen as low-value waste products. But with a bit of effort that so-called waste can be transformed into a better, higher-value commodity like animal feed. Circular systems aim to throw away as little as possible, find a high-quality use for waste products, use resources wisely, and cut down on how much we impact the environment. By using circular methods, we can create diets that provide proper nutrition with less land and fewer heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. Research conducted by WWF explored multiple approaches to elevate excess food from waste into feed for egg-laying hens including: Each approach has tradeoffs and requires more research to properly implement them. However, there is evidence that these approaches can offer environmental advantages, specifically in addressing issues like deforestation and the conversion of vital ecosystems into agricultural land. As we navigate the complexities of increasing global demand for animal-sourced food, the path to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious food future is within our grasp. By reimagining our food system to minimize waste, efficiently use resources, and reduce environmental impact, we can create a world where what's on our plates contributes to a healthier planet. The journey toward sustainability is not just theoretical; it's happening now. WWF is at the forefront of initiatives that champion these transformative practices. Through partnerships, projects, and other ongoing efforts, we’re actively working to turn these sustainable aspirations into reality. Together, we can shape an environmentally friendly future that goes beyond just the choices we make about what goes on our dinner plates and instead includes a successfully engineered and sustainable feed system.
