The Global Environment Facility: Big solutions for a small planet Even prior to achieving status as a GEF agency, WWF played a key role in conceiving this sizeable effort and will execute the elements specifically focused on improving the way we harvest tuna. We have begun work with more than 100 country governments, five regional tuna fishery management organizations, the private sector and others to find sustainable ways to harvest this heavily consumed species. This is an enormous undertaking, and the GEFâ€™s grant supports a goal that is nothing short of transforming the global tuna industry. This alone will be a major victory, with myriad benefits for marine life, fisheries and communities worldwide. Moreover, we know that if we can get it right with tuna, we can replicate this success with other commercial fish species. The potential ripple effects are huge. From conserving biodiversity to addressing climate change, the GEF has immense power to invest in new ideas, bring together influential partners and take solutions to scale across the globe. As a GEF project agency, WWF can now leverage this power to protect some of the most vulnerable species, places and communities on Earth. Learn more about conservation and public policy.
