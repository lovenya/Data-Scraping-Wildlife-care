Building just and sustainable food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa When Michael Fredericksen was in the Peace Corps in Tanzania about 20 years ago, the Great Ruaha River and the surrounding wetlands teemed with diverse wildlife and abundant water year-round. I met him on a recent trip to eastern Africa, where he still lives and works. Michael explained that deforestation, climate change, agriculture and hydroelectric dams have taken their toll on the region.

Wetland communities in neighboring Zambia also suffer under the weight of competing demands for water and other natural resources. There, I met with Wilfred Moonga, a passionate park warden and wildlife advocate at Lochinvar National Park. Wilfred explained how wildlife, native cattle farmers, migrant fishers, large sugar plantations and increasing hydropower demand are vying for resources. The CARE-WWF Alliance was founded in partnership with the Sall Family Foundation in 2008 and continues to thrive thanks to their longstanding support. Our joint work is also generously supported by USAID, several anonymous foundations and many others.
