Thinking about freshwater often brings to mind pictures of flowing streams and crystal clear lakes, but actually, almost all freshwater in the world (that is not frozen and locked away in ice caps and glaciers) is groundwater. Groundwater is the water found underground in the cracks and spaces in soil, sand, and rock. It is held in aquifers—permeable water-bearing rock and/or sediment—and can be extracted through wells or bubbles up naturally through a spring or is discharged into lakes or streams. Even though it’s underground, when it does bubble up or flow into streams, groundwater helps to replenish and maintain levels of surface water—the bodies of water that we are used to seeing such as rivers, lakes, streams. Groundwater helps to keep our rivers flowing.

Groundwater is used for drinking water by close to 50% of the people in the United States, but its largest use is for crop irrigation and agricultural production. WWF-Mexico has made progress on an Aquifer Recharge project on the Mexican portion of the RGRB. The program has created a management plan focused on rainwater capture and ground infiltration to replenish the aquifers and stabilize ongoing usage. This work is considered a nature-based solution, which is a type of intervention that is aligned with nature and can help build resilience in the face of climate change.

As climate change worsens, groundwater stores will become more and more critical to maintaining our access to safe, drinkable water. What we need now to prevent groundwater pollution in homes and cities is to ensure proper disposal of waste and chemicals, promote aquifer recharge interventions at scale, support efforts to raise awareness such as the Global Groundwater Sustainability Call to Action, and to push local, state, and federal policymakers to protect groundwater and strengthen water governance by adding measures like the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.
