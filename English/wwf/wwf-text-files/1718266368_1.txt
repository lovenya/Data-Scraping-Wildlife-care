WWF’s report also shares hopeful conservation success stories, including those related to monkeys in Costa Rica and gorillas in central and east Africa, noting that with the right solutions, forest-dwelling species can recover and thrive again.

Global leaders must take action now to stop climate breakdown, safeguard our planet’s remaining natural spaces, and make our consumption and production model more sustainable. Consumers can make more informed choices like choosing forest-based products, from paper products to furniture, with the FSC label.
