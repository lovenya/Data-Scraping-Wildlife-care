Transformative action can help curb the worst impacts of the climate crisis Nature can help us.
Nature is an undeniable tool for buffering the impacts of the climate crisis.

Areas with large-scale degradation have worse impacts than places that invest in maintaining robust and healthy natural resources. Nature-based solutions—natural systems or processes used to help achieve societal goals—can help protect infrastructure, health, and more. Mangroves along a coastline can help shelter buildings onshore, for example. And wetlands can prevent extreme flooding. Nature can help us. We can still stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius—and every fraction of a degree matters.
The science shows that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will substantially reduce loss and damage to people and ecosystems. We also have time to better prepare for the impacts we can no longer avoid. We just need to act quickly and at scale. We can still stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius—and every fraction of a degree matters. We need transformative action.
We don't need to panic or feel defeated. We need productivity. We already know what to do about the climate crisis, and we have solutions and policies ready to deploy to meet this challenge. The choices we make now will determine our future—one in which people and nature thrive rather than simply survive. What we do today will impact emissions, the level of global warming, and the severity of climate risks in the future. We need transformative action.
