Iris Mwanza grew up in Zambia going on safari with her family. “This was before it was a glamorous thing to do,” she says, laughing. “We would pile into the family car and drive to the game park, then drive around the loops looking for animals and birds.” Of course, as youngsters, she and her siblings found the constant stopping at the behest of their mother to look for a particular bird terribly boring. But as she grew older, her thinking about these trips changed. They were important touchstones—for her family, and for keeping track of this beloved landscape as it changed. “We always saw something different on safari,” Mwanza says. “We didn’t see wild dogs for 16 years, and then all of a sudden there they were.” She also noticed behavior changes in the animals. Their car was once chased by a herd of elephants during a trip into the northern part of Luangwa Park, where there had been a rash of poaching. By contrast, in the southern part of the park, where antipoaching efforts were robust, the animals didn’t seem to be bothered. View all issues h
