The white bellbird, native to the Amazon rain forest, has the loudest recorded call of any bird: 125 decibels, or roughly as loud as a rock concert. It uses this call not for long-distance communication or to intimidate predators but to woo potential mates. This pigeon-sized bird is no Frank Sinatra, though. Its hair-raising song sounds more like an emergency alarm than a lover’s warble. (Trust us: Look it up.) 125 decibels SIZE About 11" long
DIET Fruit SIZE DIET NOISE LEVEL CHART (in decibels) NOISE LEVEL CHART Researchers have found that male white bellbirds sing loudest around females, likely in attempts to attract a partner. When a female perches nearby, the male begins its song, then pivots to face her head-on and belts his most ear-splitting note. Females may favor the loudest males. Unlike males, females don’t have wattles or a mating call. In fact, they barely make any noise at all. View all issues h
