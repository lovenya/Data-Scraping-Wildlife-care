In the small village of Ambakivao, Madagascar, a group of women have stepped up to become their community’s first solar engineers. These volunteers—dubbed the solar grandmothers—are working to bring electricity to nearly 200 families in their village. Traditionally, their community used petroleum lamps for lighting their homes. Now they have implemented solar lamps for lighting and other household tasks. The use of solar energy reduces pollution and the community’s overall footprint. The Barefoot College is an Indian training center that develops simple, sustainable solutions to the challenges of rural life including access to clean water, education, health care, and the use of renewable energy. Since 2012, WWF has partnered with the college, Indian and Malagasy governments and several additional international institutions on the solar engineering program.
