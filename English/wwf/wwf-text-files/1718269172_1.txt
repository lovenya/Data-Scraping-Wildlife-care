I love you world. Love your seven different faces. Love your healing waters wide and deep. Love the thing you have with the sun and moon and what it teaches us about companionship, about change, about revolution. Love the mirror at your navel, how it shows off your hemispheres, illustrating important lessons about balance, about reflection, about centering ourselves. Love how much like little worlds we are. How our earthquake is your shiver, your sneeze a tsunami, an avalanche, a mudslide. When you have hot flashes we call it drought. You once covered your whole body with ice to cool a fever. When you weep, daily, over our continued ignorance, our epic failures and petty squabbles â€”our every transgression, your waters break and we are born again. Love your outreach, our mutual attraction, your gravitational pull. For every treasure we steal from your womb you send us hail and thunderstorms. When we invent poisons and no antidotes and build monuments to ourselves you send tornadoes and hurricanes to remind us of how small we truly are. And yet, every day you continue to humble, inspire, and move us to tears with your natural beauty. Our own efforts to mimic your vistas are what we dare call art and dance, music and poetry, architecture and language, and love. It is the only thing we have ever gotten right. We can't pass the course on humanity if we keep failing the lessons on harmony and until we unlearn fear and hate. Thank you, world, for this open-book exam before us, for still believing we are worthy of your love We who love you black alredy know that everything we do to you we also do to ourselves.
