WWF has had some of its great successes—our community-based conservation program in Namibia; helping to create the world’s first tribal national park—when we were able to act swiftly in the face of a singular, unexpected opportunity. Because while it may not be in our long-term plans, recognizing an opening for what it could mean to conservation forces us to look at our work through a different lens. So while establishing a new WWF office is certainly not a novelty—you can find them in more than 100 countries around the world—opening one in a country that has been closed to outside influence for 50 years certainly is.

President Obama has already paid a visit to Myanmar—and hosted its president at the White House—underscoring the global importance of the country and the region. And of course frenetic bidding is under way by businesses of all sizes as they seek to claim a piece of this untapped consumer market. So WWF’s new office is working with President Thein Sein’s office and local NGOs to support the growth of a green economy in Myanmar, guide sustainable forms of development, and set aside protected areas for one of the last redoubts for tigers in the world. Because the magic only happens if you’re willing to move fast.

I have great hopes that Myanmar’s leadership can chart a new course with the support of WWF and others and become a model for sustainable development in the face of the kinds of massive investments we see throughout the developing world. I also hope Myanmar will be an example writ large of what’s possible when conservation moves as quickly as the ever-shifting landscape of opportunities around us. President and CEO View all issues h
