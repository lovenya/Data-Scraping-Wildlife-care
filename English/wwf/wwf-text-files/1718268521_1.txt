When it comes to living in river ecosystems, few animals are as well adapted as mata mata turtles. These nocturnal reptiles are perfectly camouflaged for their murky freshwater surroundingsâ€”and, like many turtles, they can hold their breath for long periods of time. When mata matas need to breathe, they have a unique edge: Their narrow snouts are essentially built-in snorkels they can lift to the surface to sip in some air.
