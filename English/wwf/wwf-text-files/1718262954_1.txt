Pioneering study will help monitor one of the world’s most diverse freshwater fisheries Scientists believe Lake Niassa in Mozambique hosts more than 1,000 species of freshwater fish—meaning there could be more distinct freshwater species in this one lake than in all of the US and Canada. A WWF team, in collaboration with scientists from the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, is using underwater cameras as part of a pilot study to establish a baseline of the fish diversity of the Lake Niassa Partial Reserve. But according to local elders, the range of species is changing. “Some species have completely disappeared,” explained one of the elders from a lakeside community. “For example, funi [a large catfish] has not been seen for a long time and we have to travel far into the lake to catch Ussipa [a small, sardine-like freshwater fish].”
