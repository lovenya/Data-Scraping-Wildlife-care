Dendrochronologist Kathelyn Paredes Villanueva sheds light on Bolivia’s forests, one tree ring at a time AGE: 29
 HOME: Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia
 CAUSE: Using data about tree rings to evaluate the effects of various environmental and man-made factors on forest health AGE: HOME: CAUSE: Kathelyn Paredes is used to telling people that a certain decoration in her house is not for sale. “My father is an auto mechanic, so there are always clients stopping by for car repairs,” she says. “But then they see this beautiful cross-section of a tree on display in the front hall, and many of them ask to buy it.” Paredes, who lives in Bolivia, is a researcher in the field of dendrochronology—the study of changes in the climate and environment through comparing the growth rings in trees. It’s a discipline she discovered when her college, the Universidad Autónoma Gabriel René Moreno, received funding for some new forestry laboratories. She was fascinated by the one with dendrochronology equipment. Paredes read everything she could on the subject before proposing a study of Machaerium scleroxylon, or morado, a valuable timber species grown in Bolivia. After the initial research, she spent a year and a half analyzing morado samples using the lab’s special microscope and software programs. View all issues h
