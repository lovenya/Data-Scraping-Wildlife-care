In this unprecedented and uncertain time, top of mind for all of us is the health, safety, security, and well-being of our families, employees, supporters, partners, and the community at large. We've updated these food tips related to our work on food waste and loss that we hope will help a little in these difficult times. We usually talk about how wasting food wastes environmental resources like energy, water, and land and by avoiding food waste, we can try to get food to more people globally without increasing the environmental impacts of producing it. But, right now, reducing waste is even more important and we can look at how to do that in our own kitchens.
