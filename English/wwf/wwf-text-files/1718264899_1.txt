Chris Field is confident we will solve climate change. We just need to do one thing first.

“We know what the technologies are and what kind of changes are going to be necessary,” he says. “In fact, most parts of the world are making pretty good progress. But the frustrating thing is, we’re not going fast enough. We just need to find the accelerator pedal.”

Field believes that finding that accelerator pedal will ultimately be a consequence of pressure from individuals, governments, and companies recognizing that addressing climate change isn’t about making sacrifices—it’s about heading down the path of building a better world.

Heeding his instincts is a smart bet; Field is one of the most recognized climate scientists in the world. He heads the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and helped lead the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 2008 through 2015. The IPCC is sort of a United Nations for climate and science—members are tops in their areas of expertise, and must be nominated by their governments. Approximately every seven years, the IPCC issues an assessment, which forms the scientific basis of climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and, more recently, the Paris Agreement.

“I think the most destructive discord in the conversation about climate change is that it’s often cast as, ‘Well, what do we have to sacrifice in order to solve the problem?’” Field says. He likens it to President Kennedy’s 1961 challenge to put a man on the moon within a decade: It’s not that a sacrifice was required, it’s that as a country we committed to make some important discoveries and some important progress. He sees the fight against climate change in very much the same light. View all issues h
