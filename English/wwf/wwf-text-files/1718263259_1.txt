A high point of the meeting came when the representative from Laos announced that Laos would not build the Xayaburi—a dam that would be an ecological and food-security disaster, create a reservoir nearly 40 miles long, and have permanent impacts on migratory fish populations and sediment flows. But only a few months later, it turned out that in fact Laos would move ahead with the dam.

Looking ahead, we want to see governments in the region enact a moratorium on dams on the main stem of the lower Mekong for at least 10 years. This will allow for proper consultation among these close neighbors and thorough environmental impact assessments. Because if the wrong dam is built, then migratory fish populations and local livelihoods will suffer, endemic species will almost certainly disappear, and the flow of sediments to Vietnam will be dangerously interrupted.

But if the cost of taking these steps is higher than the cost of building the dams—and results in lower energy production—who pays the difference? WWF’s conviction is that we can steer a middle path by putting all the right values on the table and making smart choices.

Bringing together the science and the financial institutions to sort through these trade-offs is part of WWF’s role. And connecting them is essential to avoid the destruction and loss of the extraordinary wealth of a resource that feeds the remarkable people and cultures whose fates are hitched to the mighty Mekong River.
