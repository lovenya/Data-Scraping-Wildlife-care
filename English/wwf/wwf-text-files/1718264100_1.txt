A WWF report published today warns about the economic and environmental risks of the proposed large-scale hydropower dam planned for Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania. The research says that the dam would have direct impacts on the UNESCO site’s core environmental value and tourism. It reveals that the knock-on effects of the dam in Steigler’s Gorge, in the heart of the Selous Game Reserve, also risk damaging a wetland of international importance.
. “Selous has been ground zero for elephant poaching for far too long,” said Bas Huijbregts, Manager, African Species Conservation, WWF-US. “It is imperative that Selous rangers and village game scouts in the surrounding wildlife management areas are properly trained and equipped; the judiciary system is strengthened leading to arrests and prosecution of wildlife criminals, and incentives are created for communities to protect their wildlife.” The reserve also faces threats from mining, oil and gas exploration, and dam construction. In addition to an end to wildlife crime, WWF is calling for an assessment of the impacts of these proposed industrial activities, and investment in environmentally friendly tourism that will benefit nearby communities.
