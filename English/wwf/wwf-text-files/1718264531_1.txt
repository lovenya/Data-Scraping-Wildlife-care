Delegates from the 12 snow leopard range countries met in Kathmandu to strengthen their commitment to snow leopard conservation and chart a way forward to secure a future for this elusive and endangered cat. With climate change threatening all of the Third Pole—the high mountains in Asia that are home to the snow leopard—the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (GSLEP) steering committee meeting focused on climate-smart conservation, poaching and trade, as well as snow leopard and high mountain research. At the event, Ari Nathan, regional environment officer for USAID, recalled his recent meeting with George Schaller, who went out on a quest for the elusive snow leopard in Nepal’s mountains 40 years ago. Recently, as he retraced his steps in Nepal, he said he found the biggest difference in the mountains was the impact of climate change. To combat this threat that is changing the face of mountains in the Third Pole, countries are working on climate-smart management plans for snow leopard landscapes, as part of the GSLEP goal of securing 23 such landscapes by 2020.
