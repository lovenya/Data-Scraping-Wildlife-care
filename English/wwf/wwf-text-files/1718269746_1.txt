As a result of a longstanding and steadfast commitment to conservation, Bhutan has increased the number of tigers within its borders by 27% since 2015—an astounding achievement. There are now an estimated 131 tigers in this eastern Himalayan country, according to the most recent survey conducted in 2021 and 2022. A collective effort among the Royal Government of Bhutan, local partners, and non-governmental organizations such as WWF-Bhutan serve as the foundation for this success. The Bhutan Tiger Center led efforts to monitor and research the country’s tiger population and worked with local communities to radio-collar tigers to study their movements and conduct surveys. A bright future for people and tigers

Bhutan has shown that with government support, the right conservation interventions, a robust ranger workforce, and community partnerships, tiger populations can recover—and even flourish. While the national tiger survey tallied many big cats, it also took a snapshot of the abundance of wildlife that lives alongside the iconic big cat, proving that when we protect tigers, we protect so much more. A bright future for people and tigers WWF congratulates Bhutan on its success in increasing the country’s tiger population while recognizing that even in the diverse and vast forests of this amazing country, tiger conservation progress is fragile. Bhutan is evidence of why we need robust and measurable goals focusing on living with tigers to ensure a promising future for these iconic big cats and people alike.
