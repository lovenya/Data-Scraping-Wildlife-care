Namibia wasn’t always the poster child for inclusive conservation that it is today. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, wildlife was scarce, and the country was just emerging from colonial oppression. But with a new constitution came fresh hope: In 1996, the government granted communities rights to create communal conservancies, empowering local people to manage and benefit from their natural resources while giving wildlife populations a chance to recover. It’s a model that’s seen enormous success. Today, Namibia’s 87 conservancies cover nearly 65,000 square miles—around 20% of the country—and directly employ 300 support staff, more than 1,400 local tourism staff, and over 700 game guards. Recovered wildlife populations, from elephants to desert lions, have contributed to a booming tourism industry that generates more than 14% of Namibia’s GDP. And the country has drawn attention from others hoping to learn from its gains. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, that progress was suddenly at risk. Soon after Namibia reported its first case in March 2020, the government declared a state of emergency, followed by a national lockdown that brought tourism to a standstill. Much of the world responded similarly, with many tourism-dependent communities shutting down hotels, tour companies, and transportation. Namibia’s people and wildlife—especially those in communal conservancies lacking cash reserves or alternative income streams—felt the effects almost immediately. As new bans restricted travel, thousands of people lost their jobs, increasing their vulnerability to hunger and economic hardship. Hit hardest were rural areas, where many livelihoods had already been threatened by a six-year drought. View all issues h
