Ranger, mother, and passionate conservationist, Anety Milimo talks candidly about work in Zambia’s Kafue National Park “If you aren’t clever, brave and lucky, you can be in a lot of trouble. Poachers don’t joke. They say they’ll kill you and they mean it.” As Anety Milimo speaks outside the faded turquoise walls of her home near Zambia’s Kafue National Park, she’s holding baby Erica—just a few weeks old—close to her chest. The little one only wants mama; “I can’t put her down,” laughs Anety, who is also raising her other daughter (6) and her three orphaned nieces. “With Erica, I worked up until the last day; until I went into labor. I just have a passion for wildlife. I feel like I’m missing out on a lot when I’m not out there,” she explains, gesturing towards the vast expanse of Kafue wilderness—equal in size to the state of Massachusetts—that it is her job to help protect. Nearby, tiny baby clothes dry on a washing line and a troupe of vervet monkeys chatter from the rooftop, hoping to steal some of the food that’s being prepared for the evening meal. Monkeys are the least of Anety’s worries though, because there are elephants and armed poachers around too. Anety is one of 16 women recruited in 2004 by Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) to undergo intensive training to become a ranger (known locally as a wildlife police officer). It’s more common to see women recruits now than it was 15 years ago, but they are still few and far between as the vast majority of rangers are still men.
