Can a spider be a social media influencer? This one is. The Australian peacock spider—named after a colorful flap that resembles a peacock’s fan—is currently experiencing its moment in the spotlight, all thanks to the internet. There were only seven identified species until 2011, when a video of one went viral and led to a flurry of interest and new discoveries. Now there are closer to 100. Good luck picking a favorite. While each peacock spider species is physically distinct, scientists rely on their unique mating dances to distinguish between them. During these rituals, which can last nearly an hour, the spider uses vibrations—including one type known as rumble-rumps—and visual clues to attract the female. If the female isn’t pleased, she may kill the male.
