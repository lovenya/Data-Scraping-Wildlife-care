The ecological benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) are well-documented. By limiting fishing and other human activities, MPAs can stabilize fish stocks, protect marine species, restore the resiliency of mangroves, and more. But do those gains come at a cost to local peopleâ€”or contribute to their incomes, diets, and food security? Households near MPAs with strict fishing limits are 33% wealthier than households at a greater distance. Decreased likelihood of stunting (impaired growth and development) in children living within about six miles of MPAs compared to those living farther away. Increased abundance of fish in fully protected areas of the Mesoamerican Reef compared with unprotected areas, according to a recent analysis coauthored by WWF researchers. View all issues h
