A new alliance aims to protect and restore elephant populations in Southeast Asia and China Asian elephants are the largest land mammal next to their African cousins, and an important keystone species to maintaining healthy ecosystems and safeguarding other species with whom they share habitat. Sadly, Asian elephants are globally endangered and particularly threatened in Southeast Asia and southern China, where only about 8,000-11,000 wild elephants share space in some of the most densely populated countries. Through the Elly Allies—a collaborative endeavor seeking to tackle the challenges confronting wild elephants in the region—WWF will foster partnerships with communities, governments, the private sector, and others to save Asian elephants. Together, we will safeguard and restore elephant habitats, manage human-elephant conflict, and understand and protect declining populations.
