An exorbitant amount of plastic waste continues to plague our oceans, threatening marine life and the people who depend on these waters for their livelihoods. An estimated 11 million metric tons of plastic enters our oceans each yearâ€”the equivalent of at least a dump truck per minute. Despite the dire scope of this crisis, the growing momentum to address it is promising. Over 757,000 people have signed WWF's fight against plastic pollution. More and more companies are making large-scale commitments to eliminate unnecessary plastic and make their plastic reusable, recyclable or compostable. And 76 countries launched a declaration calling for a United Nations globally binding treaty to address plastic pollution. And while we need everyone to be a part of the plastic waste solution, some actions weigh more than others. Right now, all eyes are on the United States, where the actions we take in the year ahead can have a profound influence on the course of the plastic waste crisis.
