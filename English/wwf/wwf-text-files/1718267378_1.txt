As seasonal waters ebb and flow, the movements of elephants and other wildlife follow. When water sources are more abundant, for example, ranges may expand, but when water is scarce, wildlife can come into conflict with humans and each other. WWF is working hard to understand these movements, to support the continuation of natural systems, to strengthen communities, and to ensure that these vital migrations—across vast areas where people and wildlife must coexist—continue. To facilitate wildlife movement across the region, the five KAZA countries have defined six “wildlife dispersal areas” based on existing and historical animal migration routes. These “WDAs” are key corridors for allowing wildlife such as elephants to move more freely across the landscape, spurring healthy species population growth and distributing wildlife-dependent economic benefits to more people. KAZA boundary Country borders Major towns Rivers Roads Deltas Dams National parks A gap in the Namibia-Botswana border fence allows movements of elephants and other species from northern Botswana into Namibia and southern Angola on the west side of the Kwando River. A state forest and community-designated wildlife corridor allow elephants and other species to move between Mudumu National Park in Namibia and Sioma Ngwezi National Park in Zambia. In the wet season, elephants move out of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe and across an unfenced border into northern Botswana. View all issues h
