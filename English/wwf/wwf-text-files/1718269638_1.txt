Nearly 80% of East Africans rely on growing and selling crops for family income, yet severe floods, droughts, and locust invasions increasingly ravage their crops. The disastrous, climate change-driven weather events that hit the region trigger a spiral of consequences, and lackluster harvests mean lost income and a struggle to keep food on the table. “It’s really hard to conserve natural resources or even think about long-term management of an area when you’re trying to feed your family,” says Cheryl Margoluis, executive director of the CARE-WWF Alliance, a partnership centered on development-meets-conservation solutions. “Communities want to be a part of programs that help them manage resources with long-term conservation benefits, but that also help them meet their immediate household needs.” Sowing Change, a new global program from the Alliance, will provide training, support, and financing to help women and communities find new and innovative ways to earn income while also caring for the environment. Through solutions like native plant nurseries and beekeeping, they will be able to meet their families’ practical needs for food, school fees, and health care while helping to restore the landscape for future generations. The program will capitalize on each organization’s strengths: CARE’s development savvy and WWF’s landscape restoration expertise. View all issues h
