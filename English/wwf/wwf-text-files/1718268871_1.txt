A survey of communities in 11 African countries set out to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism. The findings highlight the vulnerability of the sector to outside shocks and the need tourism-dependent communities have for diversified income streams. Africa supports the world’s most diverse and abundant large-mammal populations, and approximately 17% of the continent’s land area is designated as under protection. These vast areas have attracted travelers from around the world wanting to see elephants, lions, and gorillas in their natural habitats, as well as rare birds and pristine landscapes. Increasingly, Africa’s rich cultural heritage has driven tourism, too. As recently as 2019, Africa’s tourism industry was growing faster than its economy as a whole. It seemed able to transform the protection of biodiversity into the dollars and cents rural communities needed to survive. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and the global travel bans that took effect in March 2020. 1 Botswana
