Oceans interact with our atmosphere, regulating the global climate and impacting everything from temperature to weather. But we’re seeing changes in this interaction. The exchange is intensifying and affecting these fishers in Mozambique. All of these alterations aggravate the negative impacts of overfishing, illegal fishing, and other major threats such as pollution and habitat degradation. But for all of the challenges, there is a positive spirit and can-do within this group of fishers. This is a social community built on fishing and farming, and reliant on the good health of the biologically complex coastal marine ecosystem that is their home. So they are seeking solutions. Working in partnership with local and national government, the CARE-WWF Alliance, local businesses, and fishing communities, WWF is restoring and protecting vital mangroves along the coastal estuaries of the bay. Through a combination of marine sanctuaries and conservation agriculture initiatives, we’re building the foundation that provides a basis for sustainable livelihoods, alleviating pressure from the climate-stressed natural resources. And following a series of destructive cyclones, disaster-relief shelters were constructed to address food insecurity and disaster risk reduction. Now it is time for governments from around the world to step up and take action for climate and protect our oceans. The CARE-WWF Alliance was founded in partnership with the Sall Family Foundation in 2008 and continues to thrive thanks to their longstanding support. Our joint work is also generously supported by USAID, several anonymous foundations and many others.
