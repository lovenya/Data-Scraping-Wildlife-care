Throughout high school, Ginny Busch thought she would become a vet. She grew up loving animals, and her fondest childhood memories include visiting her grandfather at his farm in south St. Louis County. “We didn’t have livestock, but we had lots of space, and cats and dogs and goats and horses,” Busch says. “I had a ton of outdoor nature experience as a kid, and whenever I was outside I was definitely in my happy place.” But after interning at the office where her family pets were treated, she decided it wasn’t the career for her after all: “I decided I’d be happier working with animals in a setting that felt more natural.” Busch grew up also visiting the Busch Gardens and SeaWorld parks, which were part of her family’s business at the time. During these visits, another seed was planted: the impact it has on people when they are not only around animals, but also have the chance to interact with them. “That was when I first began to realize there was a human side to conservation,” she says, “and how important hands-on experiences could be in nurturing it.” View all issues h
