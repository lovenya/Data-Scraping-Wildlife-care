For a while, the only detectable movements are those of the herd lumbering slowly and steadily ahead. With a sudden whoosh, a tranquilizer dart is fired at a female elephant in the group. It takes around 20 minutes for the sedative to take effect. Once it does, and the animal can be approached safely, the members of the elephant collaring team emerge from their hiding places in the brush and spring into action. The team—comprised of veterinarian Cheryl Cheah and her assistants from the Elephant Conservation Unit at WWF-Malaysia, alongside their counterparts from Sabah’s State Forestry Department—moves together with agility and speed. According to Cheah, there have been as many as 30 elephant deaths in Sabah in the past three years, believed to be a result of conflict with humans. By collaring to track the elephants’ movement and gaining an understanding of where they have been and where they are going, members of the WWF Elephant Conservation Unit and their partners are able to develop strategies to reduce potential conflicts.
