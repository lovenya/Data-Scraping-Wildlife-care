“I believe WWF’s Earth for Life initiative represents our best chance to ... protect what’s left of these intact natural systems.” WWF is the first organization to create a program dedicated to setting up, testing, and replicating this financing model to achieve globally significant conservation goals. And I spend most of my days actively building partnerships to do this at increasingly large scales. In practice, closing these deals is complicated and must be driven by a country’s vision. Bhutan is a perfect example. They enshrined conservation goals in their constitution, balancing development objectives with sustainability. Working with WWF, they raised funds to support their conservation goals for a period of 15 years, when they anticipate being able to fund these efforts themselves. Though Bhutan is a tiny country, Bhutan for Life has paved the way for Earth for Life, challenging other countries to adopt the same approach. This approach also worked in the Amazon, with the Amazon Region Protected Areas for Life program, a $215 million deal to secure over 148 million acres of the Brazilian Amazon against threats like unsustainable logging and climate change. It worked in Peru. And we’re going to be working with Namibia soon. Of course, COVID-19 has pushed conservation and climate change lower on countries’ political agendas. So we are reassessing our assumptions about future tourism revenues for conservation and introducing other kinds of economic activities near protected areas. We don’t have all the answers yet, but experts, governments, communities, and scientists are collaborating to figure out answers. My hope is that as we continue to grow the community of experts working across organizations, and across vast, transboundary landscapes, we can make an evermore convincing case that conservation and economic development can—and must—be reconciled.
