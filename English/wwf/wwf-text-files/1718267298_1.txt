Every so often, someone will ask me to identify a place that has been truly conserved. They want to hear about a glorious landscape forever protected from development, guaranteeing the wildlife there a safe and healthy home. They want to know about a river or seascape that is in perfect balance and whose precious resources will never again be overused or misappropriated. As I think about how to respond, I always pause. Because no matter how far I search for examples, I cannot name a single place where the job of conservation is actually complete. In the words of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who successfully championed the preservation of Florida’s Everglades, “the most unhappy thing about conservation is that it is never permanent. If we save a priceless woodland today, it is threatened from another quarter tomorrow.” Carter Roberts
