Remember those small, paper milk cartons you’d get every day from the bustling, fluorescent-lit school cafeteria? They’re ubiquitous. School cafeterias in the United States hand out 275 million half-pint cartons of milk to students each day. But this distribution method leads to a huge amount of waste. To be precise, up to 45 million gallons of milk are wasted each year, which is equivalent to 68 Olympic-size swimming pools. Here’s the good news: by switching from milk cartons to a bulk milk dispenser, large amounts of waste can be avoided. A bulk milk dispenser is what it sounds like—a big reusable container that can hold three to five gallons of milk to dispense individual portions, often into reusable cups. It might seem like a small shift, but the results are significant. “The reduction we can make daily in terms of trash is just astronomical,” said the food service director at the Poplar Bluff School District in Missouri. “Trash pickup [of milk cartons] went from once per day to twice per week.” In 2019, WWF launched its Food Waste Warrior program, setting out to help K-12 students learn about the impacts of the food system and how they can take action by slashing food waste in their schools. We worked with schools across the country to organize student-led cafeteria waste audits to identify commonly wasted lunch items. When we analyzed the results of these pilots, we estimated that up to 530,000 tons of food is wasted each year in K-12 schools—translating to $1.7 billion down the drain and a big impact on the planet.
