When trees are illegally or irresponsibly logged, forest ecosystems are weakened. Their ability to store carbon, shelter wildlife, filter water, and to provide food, products, and jobs for people is compromised. Global forest loss also leads to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—more than comes from all cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships in the world. But when forests thrive, they absorb carbon dioxide—and slow climate change. REDD+ recognizes and respects the rights of forest-dependent indigenous and local communities, and contributes to equitable development by strengthening their access to, and ownership of, sustainable economic opportunities. The more forests there are to store carbon, the less greenhouse gas there is to contribute to ocean acidification and to other changes in climate that raise sea levels and water temperatures, and degrade marine ecosystems. REDD+ helps maintain and enhance biodiversity within forests, where more than 80% of terrestrial species live. Well-managed natural forests almost always provide higher-quality water, which is key to improving the sustainability of freshwater systems in the world’s major river basins. View all issues h
