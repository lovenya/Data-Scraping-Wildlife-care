WILDLABS.NET creates a global, online community for tech-driven conservation solutions What do a primate biologist in Brazil, a GIS specialist in Nigeria, and an artificial intelligence developer in Silicon Valley have in common? You can find them all on WILDLABS.NET. Launched in November 2015, the online community connects conservationists and tech experts around the world, letting them crowdsource ideas and share resources that support tech-driven conservation solutions. It’s part Reddit, part research hub, and part technology fair—and it’s growing fast. WILDLABS.NET is an open community, so anyone interested can create a profile, start joining specialty discussion groups, and share research, job opportunities, and other materials on the platform. Here’s a sample of who’s connecting—and the cool solutions they’re coming up with.

Learning more about a device that an Australian shepherd had designed to protect sheep from foxes and other predators PROJECT USE OF WILDLABS.NET
Asked members what they thought of the device and if they knew of similar technology for preventing human-wildlife conflict. USE OF WILDLABS.NET OUTCOME
Learned about a comparable device called e-shepherd and shared it with a colleague at another conservation group. That colleague is now testing e-shepherd collars on livestock vulnerable to wolf and coyote attacks in the US. OUTCOME Arik Kershenbaum

Using an acoustic device to calculate the positions of howling wolves in Yellowstone National Park. PROJECT USE OF WILDLABS.NET
Asked members for ideas about how to build a cheaper, simpler audio device. USE OF WILDLABS.NET OUTCOME
Used members’ recommendations to design a new prototype that he hopes to test in the field soon. This open engineering process could help WWF with its antipoaching work in Africa and Asia. OUTCOME Isla Duporge
