A century ago, there were perhaps around 100,000 wild tigers that roamed the Earth. But over time, those numbers plummeted dramatically due to rampant habitat destruction and poaching. By 2010, the global wild tiger population had reached a low of an estimated 3,200. With the future of wild tigers at risk, leaders from 13 tiger-range countries decided it was time to act and banded together to shoot for an unprecedented goal: double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022, the next Chinese Year of the Tiger. double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022, the next Chinese Year of the Tiger Under the banner of Tx2 (otherwise known as “T Times Two”), this ambitious global recovery campaign signaled a significant turning point for tiger conservation. In the past ten years, tremendous effort and collaboration across broad landscapes has boosted resources and protections, allowing tiger numbers to increase in some countries. In 2016, for the first time in recent history and according to the latest official survey results, overall tiger numbers were on the rise; the enigmatic tiger was making a comeback. Behind such success, there is a network of people working relentlessly to make a dream a reality. Living with tigers brings many challenges, but healthy tiger populations also mean healthy forests and an opportunity for better livelihoods. Below are four individuals dedicated to the protection of tigers and helping their own country’s tiger numbers grow.
