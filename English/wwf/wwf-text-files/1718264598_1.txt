I believe that every story in World Wildlife matters. Every story is about real people, places, and wildlife, under real threats to their well-being. Every story represents the passion and urgency we feel at WWF—and tries to illuminate the most important work our staff and partners are doing, the facts about the state of the planet that worry and drive us, and the new opportunities that excite us most. And every story tries to demonstrate the ways in which WWF is putting in time and effort to change things for the better—in many cases funded almost entirely by your support. We take none of this work lightly. In this issue, we explore the implications of receding sea ice—not only for polar bears, walrus, and Arctic peoples, but also for global oil and gas infrastructure, shipping, geopolitics, and commerce. In “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” two families talk farming, conservation, and monarch butterflies. And after a year in which more than 20,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory, we follow a wildlife manager in Kenya as he helps collar elephants so they can be tracked and protected. All of these stories feel urgent to me. I hope they do to you as well. Thank you as always for your support.
