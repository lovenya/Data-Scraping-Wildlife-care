WWF's David McLaughlin engages food companies to promote sustainability What began at General Mills as a cautious, incremental approach has burgeoned into a wider embrace of environmental accountability across their sourcing. Last year, the company made a commitment to sustainably source 100% of its 10 priority ingredients by 2020.

I have been amazed by the shift that has taken place in the company’s culture. They are taking real risks and being proactive. Steve Peterson, director of sourcing and sustainability, is a Minnesota farmer himself, so he understands the issues that farmers face. He knows firsthand that reducing a farm’s ecological impact also increases its profitability.

What is equally encouraging is that General Mills’ decisions have been a wake-up call to corporate peers. I’ve attended meetings with Peterson and representatives from other big food companies where Peterson challenged them to see the writing on the wall and realize that sustainable sourcing is not only good practice, but absolutely vital for their future.

It is imperative that more companies embrace this challenge. Corporations have enormous power to reduce the environmental impacts of their supply chains. They also possess an incredibly influential voice. When a nongovernmental organization shows up at a corporate or government office, that’s one thing. But when a major company shows up and declares that resource strategies must be taken seriously, it’s an entirely different ballgame.

Earning profits is no longer enough: Ensuring sustainability is an integral part of what it means to be a successful company in the 21st century. View all issues h
