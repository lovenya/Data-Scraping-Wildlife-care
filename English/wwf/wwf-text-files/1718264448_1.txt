The plight of the Lake Saimaa seals is a hallmark of what may happen in other parts of the Arctic as the planet warms. For the third consecutive year, we experienced the hottest year on record in 2016. Climate change is the biggest threat to the survival of wildlife—such as polar bears and seals—that depends on sea ice to hunt, breed, and rest. WWF works with government leaders, businesses, and communities around the world to shift to clean, renewable energy; help people and ecosystems adapt to rapid change; and reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change.
