Each year, WWF leads a team of park rangers, conservationists from Texas’s Big Bend National Park and Mexico’s National Commission of Natural Protected Areas, and the Mexican  firefighters known as Los Diablos. Together they set controlled fires along remote stretches of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo River. Why? To beat back giant cane, a highly invasive, bamboo-like grass that traps sediment and narrows the river’s flow, burying aquatic habitat and subjecting riverside communities to flooding. Eliminating the cane helps restore a shallower, wider, more natural river, improving water security for people and wildlife on both sides of the border. View all issues h
