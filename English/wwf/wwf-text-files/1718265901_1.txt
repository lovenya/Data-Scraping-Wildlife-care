Water, like money, is a thing you can run out of if you don’t budget for it properly. And in the context of climate change, with unpredictable and severe weather events increasing in frequency, freshwater budgets are shrinking around the world. The 2011–17 California drought and Cape Town’s 2017–18 water shortage are only two examples of what can happen when freshwater supply can’t keep up with demand. But what does a proper budget for fresh water even look like? While trying to answer that question at the local or regional level is complicated enough, the Mexican government recently announced a solution for the entire country: water reserves. Lots of them. On June 5, 2018, Mexico’s then-president Enrique Peña Nieto signed a series of presidential decrees to create water reserves in nearly 300 river basins throughout the country. The water in those reserves represents 55% of Mexico’s surface water. And, according to the government, creating the reserves will guarantee water supplies for 45 million people for the next half-century. A water reserve is what it sounds like: the setting aside of volumes of water for sustaining surrounding ecosystems, as well as for protecting future water supplies. View all issues h
