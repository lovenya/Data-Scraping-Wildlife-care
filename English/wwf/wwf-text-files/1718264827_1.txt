Many people may not know that access to fresh water around the globe can have big impacts here in the US. Access to fresh water means biodiversity, economies and communities can thrive. Lack of water, on the other hand, can lead to social disruptions and conflict – and this often has trickle-down effects on the US. This week, WWF released a new book entitled Water, Security and U.S. Foreign Policy, exploring how access to water affects US national security and prosperity and how the US can respond effectively. We sat down with two WWF experts, David Reed, senior policy advisor and editor of the book, and Karin Krchnak, director of WWF’s freshwater program, to provide some background on this link between fresh water and national security. Q: First and foremost, many people may not know that fresh water is a finite resource. Can you give us some information on that?

Less than one percent of the water on Earth is fresh and accessible, and water is life – for both people and wildlife. We need it to survive, and we also need it for every aspect of life – from the food we eat to the cotton we wear to the energy we depend on. On top of that, about 10 percent of the world’s species live in lakes, rivers, wetlands and aquifers, and they are declining at a faster rate than terrestrial and ocean species. That’s why WWF is focusing on freshwater ecosystems – to help create a sustainable future for all. A (Karin):
