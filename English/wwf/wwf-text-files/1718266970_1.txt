Some of WWF’s most successful initiatives are bold, multi-stakeholder projects designed to protect large swaths of biologically sensitive land. One such project is Bhutan for Life, which raised $118 million to help ensure the country’s entire protected area system would be conserved in perpetuity. Essential to the successful launch of Bhutan for Life was buy-in from the government, Bhutan’s Royal Family, and other key constituencies, as well as strong support from a handful of private donors. Among those donors were WWF Board member Matthew C. Harris and his family. In addition to funding, Harris contributed another essential ingredient to the project: an attitude of patience. “The universe generally works in a way that we get what’s good for us, but not always when we want it,” says Harris. “Audacious projects like Bhutan for Life work like this. You do your best and work your hardest toward the result you’d like to see and then you let go of the outcome and see how it unfolds. That’s the way I try to live my life. It’s certainly the way I try to approach these projects.” And, according to Harris, if you’ve worked hard and planned well, and if you’re in the right headspace about the time sustainable conservation can take, it can even be enjoyable. “Frankly, the fun in these types of projects is allowing the process to unfold,” says Harris, a founding partner of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and leader of GIP’s global energy industry investment team. “They’re oftentimes very complicated, involving lots of different elements. And to me, it’s fascinating to see how it all plays out.” View all issues h
