It’s official: 2016 is the hottest year on record. Earth’s surface temperatures in 2016 shattered all previous record highs since modern record keeping began in 1880, NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced today. This is the third consecutive year of record warmth for the globe. And much of the warming is attributed to climate change. “The science is clear and headed in one direction. Human-caused changes in climate are putting the lives of both people and wildlife at risk,” said Lou Leonard, senior vice president of climate and energy at WWF. “From disappearing Arctic ice in Alaska to greater storm surges along our nation’s coastlines to heatwaves in America’s heartland, nature is sending a distress call.”
