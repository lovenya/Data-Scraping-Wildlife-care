On a March morning in 2023, customs officials at Hai Phong Port in Da Nang, Viet Nam, opened a container from Angola. Acting on concerns raised by the container’s route, the inspectors discovered seven tons of ivory, equivalent to the tusks of over 700 elephants. The seizure, the port’s largest, came after the US Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Saving Threatened Wildlife project held a workshop with customs officers on maritime cargo inspection and screening procedures to control and detect wildlife trafficking. Viet Nam has long been exploited by organized crime syndicates as a strategically located transport hub for the global illegal wildlife trade. “Wildlife is taken illegally from Viet Nam’s wildlife areas, it is brought into and through the country by traffickers, and it is purchased in-country for domestic use,” says Dechen Dorji, WWF’s senior director, Asian wildlife. Every year, pangolin scales, rhino horns, tiger bones, and other animal parts pass through its ports. View all issues h
