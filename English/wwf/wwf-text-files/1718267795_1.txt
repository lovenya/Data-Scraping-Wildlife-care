BACKING TIGERS
We supported local communities, government, and other civil society organizations in managing tiger habitat and reducing human-wildlife conflict in the Terai Arc Landscape. With greater protection and access to dispersal areas, Nepal’s tiger population nearly doubled in just nine years to a total of 235 in 2018. BACKING TIGERS LAB ON TRACK
The program supported the upgrading of Nepal’s only molecular diagnostic wildlife laboratory, run by consortium partner National Trust for Nature Conservation, so it can conduct genetic research on endangered species and monitor diseases that threaten wildlife, livestock, and human health. LAB ON TRACK RIGHTS AND GREEN STANDARDS 
We worked with the government of Nepal to promote human rights and conservation standards in the country’s policies and strategies. The program shared its experience and expertise with the Ministry of Forests and Environment to help revise their gender equality and social inclusion strategy and action plan in 2020. In 2019, we supported the Department of Roads in producing a training manual that includes road construction strategies to reduce landslides and keep people and wildlife safe. RIGHTS AND GREEN STANDARDS WATER AT HAND
To protect watersheds threatened by climate change and forest loss, in 2017–2019 the program helped local governments incorporate existing plans for local climate adaptation and small watershed management into their periodic plans. We also helped newly elected representatives understand the need to reduce risk of natural disasters. WATER AT HAND View all issues h
