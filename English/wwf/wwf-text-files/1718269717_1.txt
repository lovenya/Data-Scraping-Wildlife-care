When a road passing through the Lumding Reserve Forest in Assam, India, was recently expanded to a four-lane highway, it further fragmented an area used by more than 100 elephants. In response, WWF-India provided the local government with recommendations to construct several wildlife crossings that steer the mammals away from increased traffic. In 2000, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes—with support from the Center for Large Landscape Conservation— ensured that plans to reconstruct parts of Montana’s Highway 93 would include 42 new wildlife crossings. Today, more than 22,000 animals use the crossings annually, and collisions with wildlife have declined by over 70%. From 2017 to 2018, WWF-Nepal supported a camera trap project to study the effectiveness of four wildlife underpasses along Narayanghat-Mugling Road in Barandabhar Corridor Forest. Photos revealed the underpasses were used by 13 species, including wild boars, leopards, and spotted deer. View all issues h
