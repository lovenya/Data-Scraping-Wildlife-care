“My work has always had a bias towards the natural world, and this piece allowed me to draw some of the world’s most beautiful and exotic species,” notes illustrator Barry Falls (“Bridging the gap” ). Based in Belfast, Ireland, Falls’ textured work has been featured by the New York Times, the Guardian, and UNICEF. Writer Julia Symmes Cobb ("What’s a River Worth?") says “Any assignment where swimming with dolphins and learning how to hold squirming baby turtles counts as work is pretty excellent in my book.” Based in Bogotá, Colombia, Cobb has been published in the Washington Post and Reuters. Trained as an architect, artist Richard Bornemann ("Capturing atmospheric data in the Amazon") enjoys the research that goes into each project. “Learning about the technology that I’m depicting—especially technology used in remote corners of the globe—is fascinating,” he says. Bornemann’s illustrations have appeared in Wired. View all issues h
