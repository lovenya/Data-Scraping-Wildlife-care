The world’s third longest river, the China’s Yangtze River runs 3,900 miles from the Tibetan Plateau to the estuary of the East China Sea near Shanghai. It’s home to some of the highest levels of biodiversity on the planet. Local communities rely on it for food, water and transportation. But the Yangtze river basin is also under pressure from growing economic and industrial demands. WWF is working with the government of China, businesses and other conservation groups to put sustainable efforts into practice and protect this amazing ecosystem.
