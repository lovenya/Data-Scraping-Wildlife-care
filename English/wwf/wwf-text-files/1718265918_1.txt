Our November 2015 feature waded into the streams of Bristol Bay, Alaska, which churn with the world’s largest sockeye salmon run and nourish diverse communities and wildlife as well as support the seafood industry. In 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognized Bristol Bay’s significance by blocking the construction of Pebble Mine—a copper, gold, and molybdenum pit mine proposed for the bay’s headwaters that would have destroyed an estimated 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds. A politically active group of local fishers, indigenous organizations, and conservationists celebrated the win. But the threat lingered. iMAY 2017 After meeting with the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, former Administrator Scott Pruitt instructed the EPA to withdraw the agency’s plan to protect the watershed through its authority under the Clean Water Act. MAY 2017 iDEC 2017 Pebble announced that Canadian firm First Quantum Minerals would join the project with a four-year, $150 million investment plan to support the environmental permitting process and the option of a $1.35 billion investment to make it a 50% partner.
