South Texan fine artist Roberto Benavidez gives wing to the craft of papier mâché. Inspired by 16th-century paintings and multicultural art, he creates stunning piñatas of birds and other creatures. But you wouldn’t want to break open these sculptures: Benavidez painstakingly decorates them with layer upon layer of hand-cut crepe paper, referencing photos of specific birds as he works, and enhancing each bird’s feathers and coloring with fanciful embellishments like serrated fringe or metallic papers. “As an artist, I take inspiration from the natural world,” he says. “Nature is a precious resource.” All photos © Roberto Benavidez WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH MEADOWLARK NO. 2 PAINTED BUNTING NO. 2 (MALE) PAINTED BUNTING NO. 3 (FEMALE) EUROPEAN ROBIN RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD NO. 2 MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRD SILVER-LACED FRIZZLE PATTERSON HUMMINGBIRD GOLDEN-FRONTED WOODPECKER RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD BLACK-CRESTED TITMOUSE MEADOWLARK NO. 3 BUFF-BELLIED HUMMINGBIRD PILEATED WOODPECKER View all issues h
