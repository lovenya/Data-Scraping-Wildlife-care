Wusa was a dedicated gorilla mother, doing her best to care for her three-month-old infant. But WWF staffers noticed something amiss with the adult gorilla in the Dzanag-Sangha Protected Areas of the Central African Republic. Her wrist was caught in a metal snare. Snares are generally intended to catch small forest mammals in the forests. But great apes like Wusa can accidentally get caught and injured by them. If not treated, these snare-inflicted injuries can result in infection and eventually death. The metal snare embedding itself into Wusaâ€™s wrist was causing her hand to swell and preventing her from putting weight on that hand, making mobility and caring for her three-month old infant difficult.
