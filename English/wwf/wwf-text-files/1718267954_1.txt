Storeygard, A., Balk, D., Gittleman, J.L. & Daszak, P. (2008). Global trends in emerging infectious
diseases. Nature, 451, 990–993. While the exact source of COVID-19 remains unclear, zoonotic diseases like
COVID-19 — diseases that originated in animals — are a stark reminder of how people and nature are
interconnected. Other serious outbreaks, such as SARS, avian flu, and MERS, were all zoonotic in origin.
Animals aren’t to blame for these outbreaks. It’s human activities that encroach unsustainably into wild
places and risky interactions with wildlife that create increased risk. Zoonotic disease spillovers like this occur when a disease jumps from
animals—wild or domestic—to humans. Any number of interactions can lead to spillover events: a
hunter transporting the meat of a wild animal shot in a forest near home, a farmer tending to the family's
livestock at forest’s edge, or a vendor selling goods in an urban market. The “spillover” of a zoonotic disease to a person can occur when a
person is bitten by a wild animal; when someone is exposed to feces, blood, or saliva of a wild animal or of
a domesticated animal that has been exposed to a wild animal; or simply from breathing aerosolized virus
coming from sick animals in a wildlife market or elsewhere. Most pathogens that inhabit animals pose a minor threat to people. However, novel zoonoses—meaning those
which have not been previously identified—are emerging with increasing frequency. Three to four new infectious disease outbreaks occur each year. Up to 76% of them come from animals. [1][1] Jones, K.E., Patel, N.G., Levy, M.A.,

This field of scientific research is still evolving, but research suggests greater risk for zoonotic
spillover happens in: Places with high levels of biodiversity, like the tropics, where large scale deforestation is happening.
[3][3] https://mol.org/patterns/richnessrarity Places where land conversion for food and livestock production is destroying or fragmenting
biodiversity-rich tropical and subtropical forests. Places where the trade and farming of wild animals is common, putting people and domestic animals in
sustained, close contact with wildlife. Why does there seem to be an occurence of almost 3x more of such spillover
events happening in the last 20 to 30 years? What is different now? Use these controls to navigate the globe This data representation is intended to be indicative and correlative of the scale of forest loss and
wildlife trade across areas with high mammalian and avian biodiversity (species richness) The answer to this question may be found by better understanding our changing
relationship with nature. As humans push into the last blocks of natural habitats, especially tropical
forests, we encounter more and more novel viruses and pathogens that may be a risk to people. People settling
and working in newly opened forests interact with these new diseases. The answer to this question may be found by better understanding our changing
