Deep within the jungles of Malaysia prowl the countryâ€™s last remaining tigers. With fewer than 150 individuals, tigers here are on the brink of extinction. So imagine the surprise and joy when tiger conservationists at WWF-Malaysia spotted a tigress with four cubs on camera traps set up to monitor this population. The recent discovery coincides with increased efforts in the country to secure a future for this iconic big cat.
