Saimaa ringed seals safely give birth in man-made snow banks This past winter, the rareÂ ringed seals of Lake Saimaa received a lifeline via man-made snowbanks. The seals were struggling to find nests to give birth, so a group of volunteers, including WWF, went to work to create snow banks for them. Out of the 81 pups born months later, 90% were born in these man-made snowbanks.
