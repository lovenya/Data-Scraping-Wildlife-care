Our forests are in crisis. Nearly half of all global forests are under threat of deforestation and forest degradation, which represents a major risk to global climate, biodiversity, water, people, and businesses who depend on healthy forests. In the past several years we’ve seen unprecedented commitments from businesses to cut deforestation out of their supply chains. This is critical. But in the face of compounding threats, including the accelerating impacts of climate change, “doing less harm” is no longer enough. It’s time for proactive strategies to conserve the world’s forests. And, the private sector can – and must – be part of that solution. HP is one company that’s responding to this need for action. WWF and HP are embarking on an ambitious partnership to help restore, protect and improve the management of global conserve forests, starting with nearly 200,000 acres in Brazil and China. Through this project, HP isn’t just taking responsibility for their own paper sourcing footprint, which includes sourcing from Brazil and China, they also aim to grow the total global supply of more responsible fiber in those regions for a positive environmental impact and to cover the fiber footprint of paper used in their consumer printers over the course of the collaboration.
