9 simple ways to fight climate change Around the globe, we are already feeling the effects of climate change: extreme weather events, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels, to name a few. These impacts may sometimes leave us feeling helpless. But if we act now, we can stave off the most dire impacts of a warming world. There is plenty that we can do as individuals to make a real difference. Together, we can better prepare for these risks and shift the way we all use energy and engage with the environment. For four decades, WWF has been part of the movement to fight this global crisis. Our vision is a world powered by renewable energy, where communities and ecosystems are resilient in the face of climate changes. Each and every one of us can engage in the movement to help animals, people and the planet. Now that you've joined hundreds of millions of people around the world in switching of your lights for one designated hour, continue to show your solidarity for climate action. Try to tackle one, two, or even all nineÂ of the items on this list below. With your help, we can all move toward a safer world for ourselves, our children and the rest of life on Earth.
