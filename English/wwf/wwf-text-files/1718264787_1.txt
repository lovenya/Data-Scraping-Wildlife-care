She recognized that to change people’s behavior, she had to change their thinking. "I realized," she recalls, "it was first necessary for the villagers to see that the Earth was theirs to protect—that it belongs to them." In Ak-Shyrak and other similar, isolated mountain villages, Farida started holding conservation workshops for adults. She organized children’s theater productions full of skits and songs about biodiversity. She also organized games and festivals around events like Forest Day. She persistently worked with government officials, rallied supporters, delivered petitions, wrote letters, and engaged media. Though threatened with arrest, she refused to give up. Over the years, her work paid off. Farida convinced officials to view environmental impacts differently and understand the challenges associated with habitat loss and climate change.  Poachers shifted from hunting snow leopards to protecting them as park rangers. Herders embraced more sustainable practices. Women began crafting and selling eco-friendly goods. And the children lead a range of festivities for Snow Leopard Day. Kyrgyzstan is not the only country with villages like Ak-Shyrak. Asia’s high mountains stretch across 12 countries, each with remote mountaintop villages perched on the edge of snow leopard habitat, the border of what’s livable for human beings, and the front lines of climate change. These mountains are also known as the Third Pole and host the headwaters of rivers that sustain millions of people. Protecting high mountain cultures, waterways, and the elusive snow leopards of these transboundary ecosystems requires getting nations—even traditional adversaries—to collaborate.
