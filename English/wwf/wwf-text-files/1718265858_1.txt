New studies show the law is producing positive results China made it illegal to buy and sell elephant ivory at the end of last year, and the law is already producing positive results. Among 2,000 people surveyed across 15 Chinese cities with ivory markets, those who previously said that they’d either bought elephant ivory products in the past and planned to do so again, or wanted to buy ivory products for the first time, dropped substantially now that the law is in full force, according to two new studies by WWF and TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network. Additionally, all pre-ban legal ivory shops visited by wildlife trafficking experts in 2018 had stopped selling elephant ivory, and the magnitude of illegal ivory trade in most of the cities and online platforms surveyed had dropped. Despite these promising results, there’s still more work to do. Elephant ivory trafficking hotspots remain in China, including along its border with Vietnam. Awareness of the ban is also low. WWF spoke with Ming Yao, a member of WWF’s wildlife conservation team who has worked closely on ivory demand reduction projects, to learn more about her point of view on China’s ivory ban and how it has influenced consumer behavior in her country.
