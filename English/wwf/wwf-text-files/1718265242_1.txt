Just because you don’t see something, doesn’t mean it isn’t there. As a scientist on the WWF wildlife conservation team, my role is to my role is better understand the complex interactions among rhino populations and apply that to our animal monitoring and conservation work. While that concept may sound complicated, the simple fact is that we never know true population numbers because most of the species we are dealing with are rarely seen in the wild. Most often, all we have is a footprint in the mud, a scratch on a tree or a picture from a camera-trap. We use these clues as a positive sign that rhinos are present and in some cases, we can convert them into numbers to gauge the real state of a population and how numbers are changing over time.
