Toilets play an essential role in both the health of people and the environment. Proper waste disposal and management equates to cleaner waterways, lower likelihood of lethal diseases and parasites, improved gender equality and education by allowing girls to stay in school during menstruation, and benefits to the economy by creating jobs and increasing productivity. Billions of people worldwide do not have access to toilet facilities and therefore risk their health and safety. Recently, with support from USAID and in partnership with the regional river basin organization, the Zambezi Watercourse Commission, WWF assessed the health and status of the Kwando (Cuando) River basin that crosses Angola, Zambia, Namibia, and Botswana. Although the researchers found the landscape to be in good condition, many communities surrounding the river basin face extreme poverty and lack access to waste management infrastructure, which has the potential to diminish both the health of the community and the landscape. Therefore, the Kwando basin offers an opportunity to boost human prosperity while sustainably managing and maintaining the local environment. There is an urgent need to improve access to clean water and safe waste management while integrating sustainable landscape management. Healthy and thriving people and communities lead to the sustained health of river basins.
