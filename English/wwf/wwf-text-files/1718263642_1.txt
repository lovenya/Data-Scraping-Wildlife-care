Many wood products in American homes—from the kitchen table to hardwood floors—come from the same forested areas in Africa where elephants, rhinos, lions and other magnificent species roam wild. Few purchasers know that the wood from these forests is illegal. It was harvested, transported, processed, bought or sold in violation of national laws. Illegal logging destroys the same forests that nearly 80 percent of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species rely on to survive. And the same forests that absorb carbon, one of the best ways to address global climate change To address this issue, the governments of five African countries committed this week to curtail the illegal and unsustainable timber trade—one of the main threats to the region’s forests. Forests in these countries—Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Madagascar and Mozambique—account for nearly 50 percent of the land cover.
