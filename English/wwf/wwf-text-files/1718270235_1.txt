This October, the United Nations will hold a high-level meeting of signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a global treaty aimed at preserving the vast and vital array of living things on Earth. The 2024 meeting is especially noteworthy. Why? Conservation in a place is most likely to succeed when it is shaped around the needs and vision of those who live there. At a fundamental level, this requires proper consultation processes and safeguards to help avoid adverse outcomes for local people. The government of Nepal, for example, recently adopted guidelines for better realizing its commitment to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent—essentially the unique rights of Indigenous communities to halt or modify conservation efforts that could impact their lives. Halfway around the world in North America’s Great Plains, insecticides are vital to stop flea-borne disease from wiping out ferrets and their prairie dog prey. There, safeguards ensure those pesticides are safely applied, clearly marked, and pose minimal risk to local people and the environment. But good conservation goes beyond solely avoiding costs to people’s well-being and rights. It should also actively seek opportunities to support people in the realization of those rights, including their equitable involvement and leadership in all phases of any project or effort—from planning to implementation to evaluation.
