China is a country of incredible size and beauty and home to many of the iconic species WWF works to protect, such as giant pandas and snow leopards. As the first conservation organization invited by the government to work in China, WWF has worked for more than 50 years to protect China’s wildlife and ecosystems. The giant panda is one of conservation’s greatest success stories, recently downgraded from endangered to vulnerable on the global list of species at risk of extinction. By protecting pandas and their forest habitats, we help save an array of wildlife, including the endangered golden snub-nosed monkey, takin and crested ibis. In China’s high plateaus, WWF works to safeguard the elusive snow leopard and its fragile habitat. Threats like climate change, loss of habitat, poaching and human-wildlife conflict have driven these cats to their current endangered status. Once known as the king of the mountain, snow leopards dwell in some of the harshest conditions on the planet.
