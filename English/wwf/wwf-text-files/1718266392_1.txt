CITES brings good news for many species but others need stronger support Governments from around the world recently gathered to discuss the threat of wildlife trade on species. The world’s largest global wildlife meeting—the 18th Conference of the Parties (CoP18) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)—reviewed an unprecedented number of proposals. In the end, some species gained stronger protections, but there were unanswered questions about the future of many more. Though the meeting ended last month, action to protect the world's most vulnerable species continues. WWF works around the globe with governments, local communities, and other partners to protect vital habitats and vulnerable wildlife.
