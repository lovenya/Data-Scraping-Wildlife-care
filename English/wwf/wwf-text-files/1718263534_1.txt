The WWF Board Member applies his expertise to conservation Life is risky. Fortunately for WWF, Board member Bob Litterman understands how to anticipate and mitigate exposure to risk better than just about anybody. This is an invaluable skill in Litterman's professional life as one of the world's foremost authorities on risk (he is a member of the Risk Manager Hall of Fame). But it also comes in handy when he applies it to certain conservation challenges, such as how to manage WWF's endowment for maximum return, how to align the institution's investments with its mission, and how to create incentives that will change global behavior for the good of the planet. For Litterman, the road to WWF began with an Arizona childhood. The earliest version of nature he remembers included tarantulas, scorpions, rattle-snakes, countless varieties of cactus, and 120-degree heat in the summer: "a beautiful environment," he says, "but a very tough place for nature to thrive."
