Singapore’s determined stance against wildlife crime Following a record-breaking seizure of 9 tons of elephant ivory and 12 tons of pangolin scales last month, Singapore announced the decision to close its domestic ivory market. The country joins other significant ivory markets, including the US, UK, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, in announcing plans for domestic bans on ivory in recent years. This marks an important moment in protecting wildlife threatened by illegal wildlife trade, but more global action is needed in order to save elephants and other endangered species. Global action at CITES
Despite positive steps by a number of governments, urgent international action is still needed, which is why meetings like the upcoming Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) are so important. At CITES, governments from around the world will gather to address the trade of species under threat. Global action at CITES Vietnam is a major destination market for elephant ivory and will be a country of focus at this year’s CITES 18th Conference of Parties. WWF is urging Vietnam to close its legal domestic ivory markets and to be subjected to wider and more systematic compliance procedures within CITES. The country has yet to effectively enforce its wildlife protection laws, such as prosecuting those involved in the illegal wildlife trade and enacting policies that reduce demand for rhino horn and ivory products.
