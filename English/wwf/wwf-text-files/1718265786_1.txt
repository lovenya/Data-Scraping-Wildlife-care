Rare and never-before-seen footage of a Sumatran tiger family offers exciting proof of tigers breeding successfully in the wild. The video shows a female tigress - named Rima - and her 3 cubs growing up in Central Sumatra. Rima then meets Uma, a male Sumatra tiger, and breeds successfully to have four more tiger cubs. Yet, tigers are endangered, facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Today, there are only around 3,900 wild tigers worldwide. That’s more than a 95% decline from perhaps 100,000 just over a century ago. Top predators in the food chain, wild tigers play a crucial role in maintaining balanced ecosystems that support thousands of other species and millions of people. “If left to their own devices with enough habitat, prey and protection, tigers will breed,” said Ginette Hemley, senior vice president for wildlife conservation, WWF. “This video shows progress toward tiger population recovery in Indonesia and demonstrates what’s possible when governments, businesses and local communities work together toward a conservation goal.” WWF works closely with partners around the world to achieve the TX2 goal—to double the number of tigers in the wild. This includes supporting rangers with proper training and equipment, collaborating with governments to strengthen protected areas management, and ensuring that local communities benefit from tiger conservation. WWF also works with supporters worldwide to urge their local governments to prioritize tiger conservation, buy sustainably-sourced products that do not contribute to habitat destruction and ensure that they do not visit tiger farms or buy illegal tiger parts.
