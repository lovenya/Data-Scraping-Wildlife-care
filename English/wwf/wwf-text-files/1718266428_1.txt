Our frozen world is on the decline. But people are building a resilient future. What should be frozen solid is now thawing and melting away—and communities are already dealing with the consequences. As the planet warms at an alarming rate, glaciers, sea and lake ice, snow cover, and permafrost—ground that remains completely frozen—are all rapidly thawing and melting. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as any other place, but the impacts of this crisis are felt far beyond the Arctic circle and those who live in the world’s coldest places; rising temperatures and the swift melting of water in various solid forms are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and important natural areas globally. We explored drastically different cities and towns in both Alaska and Florida that are feeling the impacts of sea level rise and permafrost loss—among other climate impacts—today. And while the challenges these communities face are great, so, too, is their ability to rise and act on the climate crisis.

Coastal erosion is just one impact of the climate crisis. More frequent and extreme storms, droughts, heat waves, increased flood risk, and more will impact people, wildlife, and wild places everywhere. It’s up to all of us to change course immediately.
