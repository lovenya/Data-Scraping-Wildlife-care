Salmon power Bristol Bay’s remarkable productivity, returning vast quantities of marine nutrients to freshwater and terrestrial systems by feeding marine mammals, birds, and brown bears as they complete their migrations home. These nutrients flow throughout the entire landscape, fortifying plants that, in turn, feed everything from microbes to moose. From stream to lake to sea and back again, sockeye move hundreds, if not thousands, of miles during their four-to-six year lifetime, and help sustain multiple human and wild ways of life. Bald eagles are opportunistic, gorging on salmon, waterfowl, and even carrion— sustenance the bay’s clean water and abundant wildlife provide in spades. Bristol Bay’s eelgrass lagoons teem with small fish and saltwater invertebrates that fuel eiders through the winter and help them bulk up for breeding season. Moose traverse the watershed’s tundra and forest in search of the woody browse and wetland plants that grow lush in salmon-enriched soil. Fattened by a salmon-rich diet, coastal brown bears can grow to epic proportions. Bears in Bristol Bay have been known to reach 1,500 pounds. These hungry freshwater predators grow enormous on salmon eggs, alevin, and fry, making the bay a top destination for anglers from around the world. Lake Iliamna is the year-round home to a small breeding colony of harbor seals. Worldwide, there are only a handful of seal populations adapted to dwelling in lakes. These pinnipeds dive deep to feed at the bottom of the Chukchi and Bering seas. In spring and summer, thousands of males rest on four rocky beaches in Bristol Bay. The copepod- and krill-rich waters at the mouth of Bristol Bay are designated as critical habitat for this rarest of all large whale species. Belugas in bay waters feast on vast schools of outbound salmon smolts and returning adults. Echolocation helps them find prey, even in murky river mouths. View all issues h
