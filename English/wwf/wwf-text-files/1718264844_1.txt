If you’ve ever gotten together with friends to play Risk or Settlers of Catan, you know the appeal of a strategy board game. Such games turn decision-making into a fun social activity, letting you vie for imaginary kingdoms and other serious-sounding prizes as you enjoy a few drinks together. Last year, WWF decided to tap into that appeal for a conservation purpose: teaching people about river basin management. The result? A role-play game called Get the Grade. The game uses role-play to help participants understand the factors that influence a basin’s overall health, or “grade,” and how report card grades can lead to better decisions about river basin management. Here’s how: In 2015, WWF and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) partnered around creating river basin “report cards.” Created by local stakeholders, these assessments of river basin health help inform all levels of decision-making about freshwater resources. After developing Get the Grade with UMCES and the Engagement Lab at Emerson College, WWF tested it at three global environmental conferences in the fall of 2016. All three test runs were successful, and the game has now gone global: The Global Environment Fund has begun using the game to demonstrate the importance of natural resources management to its own staff, government officials, and civil society stakeholders.
