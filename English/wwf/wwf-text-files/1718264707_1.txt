World Heritage sites represent the best of what nature has to offer. Chosen for their iconic beauty and biodiversity, many of these sites provide vital habitat to globally important populations of threatened and endangered species—including one third of all wild tigers and forty percent of all African elephants. However highly concentrated areas of wildlife often attract the wrong kind of attention. A new report by WWF reveals that World Heritage sites are especially vulnerable to illegal harvesting of species listed by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), including tigers and African elephants.
