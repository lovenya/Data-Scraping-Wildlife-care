More than 32,000 acres of the Mura River and its crucial floodplains in Austria were declared a “biosphere reserve”—a major step toward conserving one of the richest natural areas in Europe. More than 53,000 WWF activists spoke up to protect the river last year. UNESCO, an agency of the United Nations that focuses on education, science, and culture, gave the river this special designation that means the area can help promote solutions that conserve wildlife while ensuring that any use of the land is done in harmony with nature. The Mura, Drava, and Danube Rivers stretch across Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, and Serbia and jointly make up one of the most species and habitats rich landscapes of the European continent. The wildlife-rich, pristine wilderness is so immaculate it’s been dubbed the “Amazon of Europe.”
