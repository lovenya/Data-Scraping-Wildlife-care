Last year was the second hottest on record, closing out the warmest decade so far. This is the sixth consecutive year in which global temperatures were the highest on record—an unprecedented streak, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Much of this consequential warming is due to the human-caused climate crisis. “The findings confirm the past decade has been the hottest on record and is yet another stark reminder that the climate crisis is here,” said Rebecca Shaw, WWF’s chief scientist. “From Australia’s catastrophic brushfires, to more frequent extreme weather events in the US, to rapidly warming oceans, the effects across the globe are devastating.”

The climate crisis worsens already life-threatening events, from more severe droughts and wildfires to more frequent and disastrous storms. As humans continue to burn fossil fuels and the amount of heat-trapping gasses entering the atmosphere continues to rise, we’re seeing impacts on people and wildlife around the globe. We still have time to change the trajectory. SIX HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD You can take swift and strong climate action right now.

The American people have made it clear that they want to see swift and strong action on climate change. It's time for Congress and the rest of the federal government to deliver.
