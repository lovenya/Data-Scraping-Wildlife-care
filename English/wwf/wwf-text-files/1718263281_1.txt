The global demand for fresh water is projected to exceed current supply by more than 40% by 2030. People from many sectors of society are recognizing the need to find solutions. “Water is not free, as we usually think. It will be a huge problem that could lead us to another war.” “Access to water, fundamental as that is, is not an end in itself. Access to water is access to education, access to work, access to—above all—the future we want for our own families and all the members of our human family.” “Water is absolutely critical for the survival of all species. When we think about conserving freshwater habitats—like rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands—we tend to think of saving river dolphins and fish. But all species depend on water: elephants, tigers, pandas—and people too.” “Previously, water was treated as a free raw material. Now, companies are realizing it can damage their brand, their credibility, their credit rating and their insurance costs.” “My house is here because the Mekong is here, because everything we have and own depends on the river.” “If we don’t take care of our water, if we fail to steward our environment sustainably, I won’t have a farm to pass on to my grandson.” View all issues h
