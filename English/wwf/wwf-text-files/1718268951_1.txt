New legislation will help protect America's iconic and imperiled landscapes This new legislation would create incentives to help reverse that trend, providing funding needed to restore and conserve America’s remaining grasslands. It will enable landowners and Native nations to ensure grasslands remain for future generations. WWF thanks Senators Wyden, Bennet, and Klobuchar for their leadership in introducing this landmark legislation.” The Grasslands Act would help kickstart the voluntary protection and restoration of grasslands and sagebrush shrub-steppe ecosystems—and the livelihoods and wildlife that depend on them—by creating a landowner-driven, voluntary, incentive-based program to conserve these imperiled landscapes. It’s urgent that we maintain these ecosystems systems today, while continuing our support for the Native nations, ranchers, farmers, and rural communities who call them home.
