The Yucatan spiny lobster project, developed in conjunction with the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the Center-West of the State of Yucat√°n, will support fishing cooperatives to make a transition from hook and dive lobster fishing to live lobster trap fishing. This transition will: 1) increase the value of fishing, as it will help move from the sale of the tail to intermediaries towards the direct marketing of live lobster to Asian markets, 2) reduce environmental impacts as the trap is more selective; and 3) increase the safety and well-being of fishermen and their families, as decompression problems associated with diving will be avoided while allowing older fishermen to continue to engage in lobster fishing.
