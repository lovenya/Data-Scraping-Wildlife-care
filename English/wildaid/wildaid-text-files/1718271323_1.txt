Neither do reports offer much detail about the shutdowns and what is happening to the animals, although Blake said he does not think animals are being culled, due to issues over compensation. Chen Hong, a peacock farmer in Liuyang, Hunan, said she is concerned about her losses and whether she will get compensation after her operations were suspended on 24 January. “We now aren’t allowed to sell the animals, transport them, or let anyone near them, and we have to sanitise the facility once every day,” Chen said. “Usually this time of year would see our farm bustling with clients and visitors. We haven’t received notice on what to do yet, and the peacocks are still here, and we probably won’t know what to do with [them] until after the outbreak is contained. “We’re very worried about the farm’s future,” she added. “The shutdown has resulted in a loss of 400,000–500,000 yuan (£44,000–55,000) in sales, and if they decide to put an outright ban on raising peacocks, we’ll lose even more, at least a million yuan(£110,000).” <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3615 size-full" src="https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3000.jpg" alt="" width="860" height="573" srcset="https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3000.jpg 860w, https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3000-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3000-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3000-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />
