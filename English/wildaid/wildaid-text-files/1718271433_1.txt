At a time when environmental protection has never been more important for the future of our planet, the jobs of rangers have arguably never been as vital or dangerous. And yet ask someone to name a well-known ranger, and most will struggle. On World Ranger Day, we want to put names and faces to just a few of these men and women who work under extraordinary pressure, in often dangerous terrain, for little pay, glory or security, to protect wild habitats and wild creatures in the face of ever growing threats from the thriving illegal wildlife trade. Rangers don’t just chase down poachers; they are in many ways the diplomats of the wildlife world, serving as vital links to tourists and communities who live alongside animals, protecting them as much as the animals, and ensuring that national parks remain safe and protected havens for all. Read on to find out what these unsung heroes do, how they’re handling the Coronavirus pandemic and why we should all salute them: Help support rangers around the world. DONATE NOW
