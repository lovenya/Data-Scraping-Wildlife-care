Hong Kong, HKSAR – November 6 2020 – Whiskers N Paws, WildAid and Yum Me Play are pleased to launch the #EndTheTrade Conservation Journey to help end the urban commercial trade of wildlife for consumption. Organized by Whiskers N Paws and Yum Me Play, and sponsored by Hysan Group and British Motors, the pop-up exhibition held from November 4 – 27 at G/F Hysan Place, aims to raise awareness about endangered wildlife facing the threat of extinction due to illegal poaching. Vada Chung, Founder of Whiskers N Paws, said: “As an organization that encourages a ‘Love Animals, Love Life mentality in Hong Kong, our philosophy aligns with the #EndTheTrade campaign. This collaboration not only reinstates our core value of caring for animal habitats (the environment? In which case add animal) and welfare, but also helps us extend this important value to the field of wildlife conservation.” The pop-up exhibition showcases three-dimensional wildlife origami models painted by four artists, who have joined together to appeal to the public in support of the #EndTheTrade campaign. Visitors can take photos with these origami models to express their commitment to and enthusiasm for wildlife conservation, followed by signing the #EndTheTrade petition at the signature station. Colleen Yu, Founder of Yum Me Play, said: “I have always believed in and supported WildAid’s approach to wildlife conservation; therefore, this is a great collaboration in conjunction with our first launch of Yum Me Experience. This is an excellent opportunity to foster children’s concept of wildlife conservation from a young age.” The #EndTheTrade campaign aims to garner signatures on the petition calling for an end to live wildlife markets and risky bushmeat consumption globally. Reports have shown that 71% of all emerging infectious diseases in the past several decades have originated from wild animals, with the rest originating from domestic animals. “We call on everyone to participate in the #EndTheTrade campaign and help save endangered wildlife”, said Dorothy Cheng, WildAid’s Hong Kong Representative. “I am very grateful to Whiskers N Paws and Yum Me Play for their unwavering support of wildlife, for joining our effort to mobilize the public and spread the message: keep them wild, keep us safe,” Cheng added. Launched by Global Wildlife Conservation, Wildlife Conservation Society, and WildAid, #EndTheTrade is endorsed globally by 400 NGOs and supported by international ambassadors including Leonardo DiCaprio, along with Hong Kong celebrity advocates also include Sammy Leung, Annie Liu, Ng Yip Kwan, Selena Lee, and Laurinda Ho.
