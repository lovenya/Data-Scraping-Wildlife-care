Last week, WildAid launched a new public campaign in China to reduce single-use plastics by encouraging consumers to bring their own reusable water bottles, cutlery and shopping bags to work and shops. This Be a #BYOer campaign is a partnership between WildAid, China Green Carbon Foundation and China Association for NGO Cooperation. This is the latest initiative under the “action starts the movement” campaign, led by one of China’s most popular celebrities, actor and singer Wang Yibo. The campaign aims to inspire action with simple steps everyone can take to reduce their carbon footprint through daily lifestyle choices. said Wang Yibo . The star is helping to promote positive lifestyle choices to the public and his 38 million social media followers. In its first week, the campaign earned 14 features on state and news media and over 229 million views and 3.6 million discussions/mentions across social media platforms, the majority of these on Weibo, China’s second-biggest platform. Up to 50 per cent of plastic is made for single-use purposes, utilized for just a few moments but remaining on the planet for several hundred years. According to , only nine percent of the plastic waste the world has ever produced has been recycled. Most ends up in landfills, dumps, or in the environment. According to , nearly every piece of plastic begins as a fossil fuel, and greenhouse gases are emitted during each stage of the plastic lifecycle. If plastic production and use grow as currently planned, by 2030, these emissions could reach 1.34 gigatons per year, which is the equivalent to the emissions released by more than 295 new 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants. said Yu Chong, the Chief Representative of WildAid China.
