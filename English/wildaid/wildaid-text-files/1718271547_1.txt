I have always felt a close connection to nature and wildlife. Growing up, I loved watching wildlife documentaries and reading books about the environment . My heroes are conservationists, as I admire their dedication towards making our planet a better place. I’ve worked closely with Thai conservation organization s such as Seub Nakhasathien Foundation and now I’m honored to join WildAid as an ambassador to fight to end the illegal wildlife trade and to prevent future pandemics . Over my 10 years photographing Thailand’s wildlife , one lesson I’ve learned is the importance of maintaining our distance from wildlife for us to co-exist in harmony. There is beauty when nature is uninterrupted and I have been fortunate to experience what this is like. I had the opportunity to photograph wildlife in Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary and spotted two tigers playing by the stream , an extremely rare sight. Perhaps it was a gift from the spirits of the forests and mountains. The stream is 100 kilometers long with no construction or human activity in sight . However, today I am unsure if I’ll ever be able to witness the same scene again due to activities that increase human-wildlife contact such as poaching, consumption, owning wildlife as pets, deforestation and infrastructure development.
