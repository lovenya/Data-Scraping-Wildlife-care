“To me, a person’s success has never been measured by the rare food that they eat or the exotic furs and leathers they wear. I, like many people who are not scientific researchers or investigators, may not know exactly where the last COVID-19 pandemic came from. However, if we look at the way people have experienced plagues in history, we can surmise the origin of COVID-19, which has plagued the world for the last six months. Although it could have played just a small part in causing the pandemic, I want to urge everyone to immediately stop the habit and the culture of wildlife consumption,” stated campaign ambassador, MC/journalist Trac Thuy Mieu. A series of three videos highlights the grim implications of wildlife consumption through tongue-in-cheek portrayals of how the pandemic has altered everyday life. From having to work from home to unemployment to wedding cancellations/postponements, the videos depict the multitude of economic and social interruptions caused by COVID-19, and demonstrate the potential serious consequences of individual behavior on our communities. The animated video “Undo a Disaster” shows viewers how one “bad” decision – in this case, choosing to dine at a bushmeat restaurant – can negatively impact the entire world through the transmission of a zoonotic disease. While evoking a creepy tone, the video is hopeful in its demonstration that we all have the power to avoid causing such a catastrophic event, simply by changing our everyday behaviors. The Host campaign warns of the public health hazards associated with wildlife trade and consumption, as many species can carry pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites, which pose a danger to humans when transmission occurs and which have and will continue to cause pandemics unless we take urgent action to counter the threat.
