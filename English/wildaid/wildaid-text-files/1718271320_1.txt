By Kathryn Romeyn Courtesy Prana By Atzaro The fairytale story of how sharks and other apex predators became a thriving population in just years is as strong an argument as any for the importance of wildlife conservation through effective, replicable enforcement programs. WildAid—a leader in building marine protected areas worldwide—provided funding that went to safety and surveillance equipment, a patrol boat, and operations to deter poachers, going so far as to advise Misool (opened in 2008) to hire former shark finners as rangers catching these illegal fishermen who also practiced reef-destroying dynamite fishing. The results were dramatic, with illegal fishing down 80% and fish populations increasing 250%. (This was by no means a rare situation: According to WildAid marine director Meaghan Brosnan, one of every five pounds of fish in the world is still harvested illegally.) <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3604 size-full" src="https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scuba-dive-misool-west-papua-indonesia-CONSERVEINDO0220.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scuba-dive-misool-west-papua-indonesia-CONSERVEINDO0220.jpg 900w, https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scuba-dive-misool-west-papua-indonesia-CONSERVEINDO0220-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scuba-dive-misool-west-papua-indonesia-CONSERVEINDO0220-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wildaid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scuba-dive-misool-west-papua-indonesia-CONSERVEINDO0220-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />
