Ever since I was a child, I ha ve had a very strong bond with the o cean. Last year I travel ed to Cancun , Mexico with WildAid in search of whale sharks – an endangered species of shark . I learned that t his animal that has been on earth for hundreds of millions of years is being driven to extinction , despite having any known natural predators ( as few animals can compete with its 10 meters long size ) .  The forces behind this are not natural at all , fueled solely by supply and demand, and it is a demand created by mankind’s trading of its fins. For this demand to be met, up to 70 million sharks are slaughtered ruthlessly every year . Each and every one of us ha s a responsibility to put a stop to this and to # End The Trade. I’ve had the great fortune of meeting them firsthand . The feeling of having them swimming around you is indescribable , sharing the ocean with these majestic creatures , I couldn’t help but be in awe of their presence. The world under the surface is very quiet and gentle . It belongs to whale sharks and all marine life. While we might be smaller than a w hale shark, we have already done massive damage to the ir home s and marine ecosystems across the world. Human s are just one of many living things on this planet , we need to learn how to coexist with all other forms of life and recreate the balance. A fter this intimate experience with these wonderful animals, I can personally feel strongly that these gentle giants do not deserve the gri m fate that awaits many of them . It is equally important to protect marine life in our oceans as wildlife in our forests, mountains, deserts , wetlands and grasslands. Through my work with WildAid, I have realized that one small step can help both wildlife in the waters and on land. I am urging you, if we can collectively channel our energy to #EndTheTrade , the world will be a better place, a safer place for all wildlife to share and cherish. Please join us in , and together we can #EndTheTrade for a better world for all wildlife and for us.  When the buying stops, the killing can too.
