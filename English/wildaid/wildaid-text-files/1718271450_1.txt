WNP will support the campaign through a series of virtual activities for customers and from the sales of a bespoke “Love Animal Love Life” collection with proceeds going to support WildAid’s wildlife conservation projects in Hong Kong. “As an organisation that encourages a ‘Love Animal Love Life’ mentality in Hong Kong, our partnership with WildAid on the #EndTheTrade campaign is very close to our hearts. This further cements our dedication to promote animal happiness and wellbeing, extending to wildlife animals,” said Vada Chung, Founder of Whiskers N Paws. The #EndTheTrade campaign aims to garner signatures on the petition calling for an end to live wildlife markets and risky bushmeat consumption globally. Reports have shown that 71% of all emerging infectious diseases in the past several decades have originated from wild animals[1], with the rest from domestic animals. “The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dangers of virus transmission from wildlife to humans, ending the trade is among the most important decisions we can make to prevent future pandemics,” said Dorothy Cheng, WildAid’s Hong Kong Representative. Launched by Global Wildlife Conservation, Wildlife Conservation Society and WildAid, #EndTheTrade is endorsed globally by 400 NGOs and supported by international ambassadors including Leonardo DiCaprio as well as celebrity advocates also include Sammy Leung, Annie Liu, Ng Yip Kwan, Selena Lee and Laurinda Ho.
