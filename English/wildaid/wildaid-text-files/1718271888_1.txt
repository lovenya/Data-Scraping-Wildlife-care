plays a crucial role in raising awareness and promoting global animal protection serves as a reminder of the importance of animals in our lives—whether they live in the wild or in our own neighborhoods—and encourages people to fight for a better world for species big and small. 1. Support legitimate sanctuaries. A true sanctuary doesn’t buy, sell, trade, or breed animals, nor does it allow public contact with wild animals.

When traveling or shopping for souvenirs, be mindful of products made from wildlife, such as ivory, exotic animal skins, or products derived from endangered species. Purchasing such items fuels illegal wildlife trade and harms wildlife populations. 3. Plant native species of flowers, trees, and bushes in your yard to conserve water and give birds and other wild animals food, shelter, and a place to raise families. 4. Check the labels of beauty and personal care products to ensure they’re cruelty-free. Also, pay close attention to ingredients—some cosmetics may contain squalene, a compound commonly made from a shark’s liver. 5. Climate actions like taking public transportation, eating less meat, and embracing vintage clothes can have a direct impact on food and clean water sources, wildlife reproduction, and habitat health.
