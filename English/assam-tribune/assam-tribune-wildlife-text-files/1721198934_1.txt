GOLAKGANJ, July 22 - The people of Dhubri district have alleged that rare varities of wildlife found here are on the verge of extinction due to wanton killing of such animals. In the past, the district was the natural habitat of wild animals and there had even been proposals to create a mini zoo and park for these animals. But due to the indifferent attitude of the authorities concerned, these proposals never materialised and eventually the killing of animals increased. The absence of a wildlife wing in the forest department and negligence by the concerned authorities has also been encouraging poaching. According to sources, the animals are mainly killed with the help of guns, though other methods such as poisoning, electrocution and the traditional bow and arrow are also used. Sources also revealed that in recent times, birds like peacook, white-winged woodduck, pheasant, dove, drake, gander, kingfisher etc., and many other rare species have come under tremendous pressure due to poaching. It may be pertinent to mention here that poaching disrupts breeding and even changes migration patterns. Several non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has appealed to the people of the district not to encourage the selling of meat of wild animals, and at the same time to motivate the people not to kill the innocent animals because they too have an equal right to live in this world like the human beings. Kulodhar Das, director of Natureï¿½s Friend, a well-known green organisation of Dhubri district demanded the establishment of a wildlife wing under the forest department. It also proposed that the Alomganj Forest area should be kept reserved for wild animals, and if possible, the proposal for a mini zoo and park should be materialised soon so that wanton killing of animals is stopped forthwith and they are protected properly. Otherwise, the day is not far off when the district will become completely devoid of the call of these rare animals.
