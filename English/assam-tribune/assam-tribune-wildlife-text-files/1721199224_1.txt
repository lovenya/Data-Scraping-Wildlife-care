DHEMAJI, Dec 29 - The waterbodies in Daying Ering Memorial Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh and areas along the Siang river have come alive with the twittering of different species of migratory aquatic birds. With the onset of the winter season, migratory birds have started arriving at the wildlife sanctuary, which is surrounded by sandbars and waterbodies, for their annual sojourn. Some of the species have travelled thousands of kilometers from their summer roosts, which are beginning to freeze and food became scarce with the advent of winter. The wildlife officials said that with the dip in mercury level, many winged visitors, including Ruddy Shelduck (Tadorna Ferruginea), Great Cormonant (Phalacrocorax Carbo), Black-bellied Tern (Sterna Acuticauda), were spotted in the waterbodies of D�Ering Wildlife Sanctuary. The winter guests are spotted at waterbodies of Borguli, Sibiyamukh and Damkolghat ranges of the wildlife sanctuary from the first week of this month. �The winged visitors were seldom seen last year as water of the Siang river became turbid. But they are arriving in large numbers this time, which caught the attention of the wildlife officials as well as nature lovers,� said Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife), Pasighat, Tasang Taga. Located on the Assam-Arunachal border near Jonai in Assam�s Dhemaji district, Daying Ering Sanctuary is sandwiched between the Siang and Sibya rivers, creating perfect conditions for wildlife to thrive. The wildlife sanctuary is considered a significant factor in maintaining the ecological balance of the region. A forest department report stated that the rich flora and fauna of the wildlife sanctuary provides quality habitat for some globally threatened species of birds like the endangered vultures and Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis Bengalensis).
