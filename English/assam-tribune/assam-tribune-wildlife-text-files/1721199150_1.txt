GUWAHATI, Nov 10 - Nature and wildlife lovers from Guwahati and other places of the State will converge on the Dighalipukhuripar tomorrow to support a global campaign for Avni, a young tigress shot dead in Pandharkawda jungle of Yavatmal district in Maharashtra. A march will be organised from the venue at 2 pm. The purpose of the global peace march is to mourn Avni, to seek justice, to bring forth awareness and to bring forth sustainable change, the organisers said. Tigers are going through a critical time. The global population of tigers has declined dramatically. According to the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), tigers are endangered animals. Humans continue to destroy the habitat that was once home to tigers. �If a country is judged by the way it treats its animals, it is very disquieting to see India�s rock-bottom status in this regard. We will keep fighting to ensure Avni�s sacrifice doesn�t go in vain and to make certain that her 10-month-old cubs are fortified,� said Dr Pranami Bhattacharyya, an activist. �It is important to understand the vital role tigers play in the ecosystem as they are one of the predators found at the top of the food chain. Without them, it can lead to overpopulation of some types of animals,� the organisers said in a release. �Based on circumstantial evidence, Avni had been held responsible for several human deaths. Supreme Court had clearly laid down the procedures for her capture. She was, however, shot dead. This happened in the middle of the night in complete violation of the protocol,� they said.
