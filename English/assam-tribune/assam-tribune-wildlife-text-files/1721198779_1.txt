KAZIRANGA, July 1 - The work on proposed flyover near wildlife corridors on National Highway-37, adjacent to Kaziranga National Park for safe passage of wild animals, has been delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic, said State Environment and Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya while addressing mediapersons at the western range of Bagori on Wednesday. He said that part of survey for the flyover construction has been done and remaining segment would be done once the situation improves. He said that DPR would be prepared by the PWD after completing the necessary works. Suklabaidya added that necessary measures would be placed on NH-37 adjacent to Kaziranga National Park for the safety of wild animals which normally prefer to cross over the highway and move towards the foothills of Karbi Anglong for safe shelter. He said that highlands constructed last year have made the movement of wild animals easier as these wild species can take shelter on those highlands amid severe flood inside the park. Forest Minister Suklabaidya said that a 22-kilometre new road-cum-highland would be constructed soon. He said that Assam has earned a remarkable achievement for converting an area of 222 square kilometres into a green vegetation area. Suklabaidya visited the flood-affected areas in the western range of Bagori of Kaziranga National Park by a speed boat along with the team of senior forest officials, including Chief Wildlife Warden MK Yadava, Director of Kaziranga National Park P Shiva Kumar, among others.
