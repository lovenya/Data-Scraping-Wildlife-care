GUWAHATI, Aug 1 - Even as the current wave of floods has extracted a heavy wildlife fatalities in Kaziranga National Park, Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) units of the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) � the wildlife rescue, care and rehabilitation facility jointly run by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), Assam Forest Department (AFD) and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) have played a key role in saving wild animals in distress. The MVS units have till date (August 1) attended 107 wildlife rescue cases during the ongoing deluge in Kaziranga. Significantly, the CWRC is attending to as many as eight rhinos � all calves separated from their mothers and now being kept under observation at the large animal nursery at CWRC. A jungle owlet and a fishing cat were also admitted to the centre for treatment during the floods. This year�s floods � the worst to have hit the State in a decade � plunged Kaziranga, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, into a deep crisis, with over 200 wildlife fatalities, including 17 rhinos, recorded so far. �MVS teams have handled 107 rescue cases in seven days. They have released 62 hog deer out of 92 rescue cases attended till date; they have also attended, with the AFD, three eastern swamp deer rescues (two of the deer survived and were brought to CWRC for treatment),� Dr Rathin Barman, deputy director, WTI and centre-in-charge, told The Assam Tribune.� Working with the Kaziranga authorities, MVS teams have also attended ten Asian one-horned rhinoceros rescue cases in a week of floods, of which one rhino died before it could be brought to the rescue centre and another was rescued and released shortly after. �The sudden influx of rescued animals � especially the large number of rhino calves � into CWRC has stretched our resources to the limit. The number of animals under our care has risen sharply in the last week and we have had to erect a temporary shelter where two baby elephants are being housed,� Dr Barman said. He added that two paddocks were also ready to the shift rhino calves into once they became stable. Several of these animals would require long-term care before they could possibly be rehabilitated in the wild. �Our veterinarians and animal keepers have been working round the clock to ensure that rescued animals get the required treatment and care. A lot of the animals have undergone trauma and are highly stressed. Several of the orphaned rhino calves in particular were injured and emaciated, and were initially not responding to our milk formula. They are now responding well,� Dr Panjit Basumatary, lead veterinarian at the centre, said. As large areas of the park are inundated in the annual monsoon floods, wild animals seek higher ground across National Highway-37 towards the foothills of Karbi Anglong. The intense flooding this year has caused unprecedented animal movement and a large number of casualties, particularly hog deer, from vehicular traffic. While the Kaziranga authorities had introduced a �Time Card� system to regulate the speed of vehicles on NH-37 during the floods, the role of MVS units � three from CWRC and one from WTI and the Japan Tiger and Elephant Fund�s Wildlife Rescue Centre at Diphu � in running round-the-clock rescue and wildlife crisis mitigation operations in the four Forest Ranges adjoining the highway has been crucial.
