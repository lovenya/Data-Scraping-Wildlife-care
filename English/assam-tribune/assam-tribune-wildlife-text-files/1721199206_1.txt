GUWAHATI, July 27 - Green Oscar winner Dr Purnima Devi Barman recently delivered a speech on the topic �Recovery of endangered greater adjutant stork in Assam, India� at the 29th International Congress for Conservation Biology (ICCB), organised by the Society for Conservation Biology in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Dr Barman took part in the event as a member of Aaranyak, an NGO working in the field of wildlife and environment. Other members of the team were Alolika Sinha, Dipankar Lahkar and Dr M Firoz Ahmed. Sinha, a wildlife biologist with Aaranyak, spoke about the factors that influence the Manas hog deer population and what are the ways out to sustain this important population of hog deer in India. Her work provides the baseline information and is the first of its kind study on this endangered species in North East India. Dipankar Lahkar, a wildlife biologist, on the other hand, painted a picture on how the tigers in Manas are on the path of recovery after the ethnopolitical disturbances had ceased. He opined that Manas is capable of harbouring more tigers than it presently does. He went on to explain how a collaborative approach indeed helped in achieving this conservation success. Dr M Firoz Ahmed, a conservation scientist of Aaranyak, attended the conference and its several key sessions to share conservation success stories from Assam. He took part in several meetings with scientists, academicians, students and donors from around the globe to strengthen conservation in the region.
