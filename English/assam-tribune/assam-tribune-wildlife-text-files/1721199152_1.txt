KAZIRANGA, May 23 - The International Day of Biodiversity was observed in Kaziranga High School, Diring on Tuesday. The programme was facilitated by The Corbett Foundation, a wildlife NGO, where school children coming different parts of Kaziranga participated in a wall painting programme. The theme of the wall painting was environment and wildlife forest. The objective of wall painting was to generate mass awareness among the students who could play an important role in protection of wildlife, their habitat and keeping the migratory corridors of wild animals intact, informed the Deputy Director of The Corbett Foundation Dr Navin Pandey. This was followed by an interactive session where two resource persons viz., Prasanta Bordoloi, a wildlife activist and a wildlife documentary filmmaker and Bubul Sharma, a writer based at Nagaon took part. During the feedback session with the students of various schools participating in observation of International Day of Biodiversity, Bordoloi asked the student community to give more emphasis on the conservation and protection of wildlife habitats to the extent possible. This would then naturally help in keeping the existing biodiversity of the forest areas completely intact. Once the living places and the shelters of different wildlife species are properly conserved, then biodiversity could be better protected, said Bordoloi. Dr Pandey informed that since paintings on the wall about nature and environment can be preserved for a long period of time, this would then definitely send a right message about the importance of environment and flora and fauna to the students and also motivate the future generations of the school. Later Bordoloi showed the students a wildlife documentary which generated a lot of interest among them. The programme was also attended by the Honorary Wildlife Warden Uttam Saikia and Research Officer of Kaziranga National Park Robin Sharma.
