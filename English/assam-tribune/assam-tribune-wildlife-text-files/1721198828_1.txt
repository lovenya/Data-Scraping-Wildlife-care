KOHORA, Aug 18 � All is not well in Kaziranga National Park� a World Heritage Site and a tiger reserve. But this time, the problem is of poaching but is being created by those big commercial establishments who have left no stone unturned to buy every possible plot of agricultural land either near the very boundary of the park area or just in the corridor of wild animals itself to start their commercial activities. If the sources are to be believed, these commercial people have high influence in the State administration, so no local civil or forest officials have any kind of say to arrest these activities. Bagori, Kanchanjuri areas near the sub-beat office are most affected where high brick walls have been erected, some of which are just on the corridor of wild animals, through which animals move to the foothills of Karbi Anglong. Tinsukia area is also affected, the sources said. Wildlife experts here feel that since there is no clear cut policy in regard to purchase or selling of land situated near the boundary of wildlife parks and sanctuaries vested interest are taking the advantage of the situation to further their business at the cost of wildlife. Now, the need of the hour is to pass a Bill in the State Assembly so that land use pattern near the forest area remain same without any kind of disturbances to wild animals otherwise Kaziranga will lose its World Heritage Site status in near future, the sources said.
