GUWAHATI, July 23 - The Gauhati High Court has rejected the bail petition of three alleged wildlife poachers charged with killing a tiger at the Manas National Park. The poachers had also removed the body parts with an intent to sell off the tiger skin and body to the smugglers. The Court after hearing the defence counsel A Kundu and special public prosecutor BK Mahajan rejected the bail petitions of Raju Brahma, Banaru Boro and Joydev Basumatary. Mahajan contended that the killing of protected animal smacks of an inter-State racket. In another case, the pre-arrest bail application of Barlangfa Daimary, who is the kingpin of the tiger poaching racket, was also rejected. On the same subject matter, another case has been registered, based on which six wildlife smugglers have been nabbed by a joint team of Assam Forest department and West Bengal Police.
