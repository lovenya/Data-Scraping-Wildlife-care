DIGBOI, Aug 2 - As a sequel to the awareness programme organised by the Society for Wildlife Conservation based at Digboi on July 18 in the Hilika Tea Estate located in the remote interior part of Tinsukia district, the children of that particular tea estate took out a procession recently round their garden carrying placards and shouting slogans for wildlife conservation and protection. In a rare bid to protect and conserve the wildlife � birds and every other species � they collected the catapults being used by the inmates � old and young � of the estate and at the end of the procession, they set fire on the collection of the catapults publicly in the playground of the estate. They also took the resolve not to kill but to protect every kind of wildlife henceforth in the presence of Baputi Handique, treasurer of the Society. The incident has sent a strong message across the district in favour of wildlife conservation. The Society for Wildlife Conservation under the leadership of Rajuraj Sonowal as president and Mahesh Borgohain as secretary has been instituting such conservation awareness programmes regularly on every Saturday for the last two months in the interior parts of Tinsukia district.
