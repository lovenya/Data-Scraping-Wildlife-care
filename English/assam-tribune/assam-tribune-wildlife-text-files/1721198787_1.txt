GOLAGHAT, April 12 ï¿½ The Deopahar Reserved Forest near Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) in Golaghat district is presently reeling under heavy pollution due to dumping of plastic garbage. It was recently observed that huge quantities of plastic garbage transported by several trucks had been dumped in the area. This move has threatened the conservation of flora and fauna in the reserve forest. The district administration and the Pollution Control Board of Assam have failed to take any liable steps against the dumping of polythene bags, papers and other assets in the Deopahar area near NRL. A NGO named Environs had recently undertaken a survey and it was observed that atleast 50,000 kg of plastic garbage had been dumped in the area. The district administration had recently banned the use of plastic bags and carrybags made of polythene. But the business community out side Golaghat town have been freely using plastic bags and carrybags made of polythene. Due to heavy dumping of plastic garbage in Deopahar RF under NRL, free movement of animals and birds have been hampered in the reserved forest. Deopahar Reserved Forest covers 133.45 hectares of land. This RF is mainly famous as a habitat of rare animals and birds besides forest products. The wild animals often swallow the plastic litter and other materials and consequently suffer from disease and unnaturally death. Deopahar is a historically famous area where ancient ruins and statues of Siva and Bishnu have been found dating 17th century. The reserve forest is now facing another grave problem, that of poaching . Poachers are active. The RF has several rare animals such as deer, pangolin wild elephants and Barmon and big cat. The local people and nature lovers of entire Deopahar area including Panka, Rajabari, Doigurung, Numaligarh and other places have appealed to the NRL authority concerned to consider the problem as a burning one and take viable measures against poachers and unsocial elements for preservation of the natural resources of Deopahar. NGOs like North East Amity Trust (NEAT), SEENE, Banajutshna Evergreen have appealed to the people to extend their full support in creating awareness among the mass people about the conservation of Deopahar RF.
