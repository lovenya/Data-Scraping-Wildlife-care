KALAIGAON, Aug 1 - In bid to create awareness among the people about wildlife in Udalguri district, Elrhino Industries Private Ltd and Army have decided to launch new schemes. A discussion was held at the Brigade Headquarters of Red Horns division recently in this regard. Elrhino Industries Private Ltd, which has been involved in making eco-friendly papers from elephant and rhino dung, has evinced keen interest in carrying out wildlife conservation schemes in the district in view of the rising cases of man-elephant conflict. Mahesh Chandra Bora and Shiela Bora of Elrhino, Col Shesh Giri and Lt Col Rohit Sarma from Army took part in the discussion. Later, it was decided that Elrhino will prepare a feasibility report for taking up conservation-related schemes in the district to motivate the youths to start conservation of nature and wildlife. Army officials present in the discussion assured full support like arranging exposure trips for schoolchildren and youths to familiar with nature and wildlife sanctuaries. It may be recalled that cases of man-elephant conflict have been on the rise due to depletion of forest cover. Several NGOs have now come forward with various schemes to save flora and fauna in the district.
