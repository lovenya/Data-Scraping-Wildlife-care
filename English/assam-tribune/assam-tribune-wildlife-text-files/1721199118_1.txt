GUWAHATI, Feb 4 - Earnings from Nature and wildlife tourism in Madhya Pradesh exceed the State�s budgetary allocations for protected forests. Assam, with its abundance and diversity of wildlife, can do better than Madhya Pradesh provided it proceeds with some vision and long-term planning. This was observed by wildlife travel expert and conservationist Julian Matthews while addressing a session on Assam�s tourism prospects on the concluding day of the �Advantage Assam� Global Investors� Summit at the Sarusajai Sports Complex here today. Matthews, who founded the UK-based Travel Operators for Tigers (TOFTigers) in 2004, said that while Assam�s Nature was world class, the management of Nature tourism was not quite top class. �But, it has the skills, people and investors to change the scenario for the better. The need is to market Assam as a unique destination � a destination that can give one a wholesome experience not to be found anywhere else,� he said. �Nature and wildlife are priceless assets for Assam. Judiciously managed Nature tourism can work wonders not just to its economy but boost its Nature and wildlife conservation immensely. It�s equally benefiting to the local communities as it will help them emerge as important stakeholders in conservation,� he said. �Investing in Nature and wildlife tourism is the most critical investment to save the planet. Nature tourism today is a $850 billion-per year industry globally, but sadly only $10 billion goes back to conservation,� he said. Matthews also urged the State government to blend its tourism promotion with its architectural heritage, including the British-day buildings and structures. Earlier, the Union Minister of State for Tourism Minister KJ Alphonso in his address referred to the �incredible variety� of the Northeast and said that the region had no parallel with any place in the world in terms of its multiple tourist attractions like landscapes, forests and wildlife, adventure, and ethnicity, cultures and cuisines. �The Northeast can be a top global tourism hub. We have a huge mandate before us and the Northeast has to be marketed appropriately. Our job is to create an amazing environment so that the world says �wow�,� he said. Terming the Global Investors� Summit as the �best ever and best managed� such event he had ever attended, Alphonso urged the prospective investors attending the meet to invest in tourism in the region. �I have been to 62 countries, attended many international events, but never before had I attended such a magnificent and well-organised summit. It shows Assam has it in it to go global on its chosen areas,� he said. Asserting that India had set a target of doubling its tourist arrivals in the next three years or even sooner, the Union Minister said that Assam, too, must strive to achieve a similar feat. �It�s for us, the stakeholders in the tourism industry, to provide a seamless and wholesome travel experience to the visitors,� he said. He also heaped praise on Assam Tourism Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for his recent tourism-related initiatives. Besides, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Union Tourism Secretary Rashmi Verma, Sandeep Maitraya of Crimson Hotel group, Ashish Phukan of Jungle Travels India, and Assam Tourism Development Corporation MD Kausar J Hilaly also addressed the function. ATDC Chairman Jayanta Malla Baruah gave the vote of thanks.
