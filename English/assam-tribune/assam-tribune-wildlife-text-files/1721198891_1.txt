GUWAHATI, Sept 29 ï¿½ The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) has demanded a White Paper from the State Government on the utilisation of the funds it has received since 2001 for wildlife conservation. The party will undertake a march to Kaziranga on October 1 at 11 am from Kohora in protest against the killing of rhinoceros by the poachers. The party members in the distant places of the State will stage demonstrations in front of their respective Forest Department offices and burn effigies of Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Forest Minister Rockybul Hussain that day. AGP working president Atul Bora (J) also alleged that the State Government has hatched a conspiracy to eliminate the rhinos of the Kaziranga National Park and then to settle the illegal migrants from Bangladesh in the Park land thus vacated. Describing the statements of the Chief Minister and the Forest Minister that the Government would hand over the cases of brutal killing of rhinoceros in Kaziranga to the CBI as a ploy to divert the attention of the people, he said that in 2008 a request from the State Government was turned down by the CBI on the plea that it was not under its purview to go into a case of rhino killing. Bora also alleged that the flood-related calamity in the State was the result of the misuse of the funds of meant for controlling flood. The relief materials supplied to the flood victims were also not sufficient, he said.
