SHILLONG, Aug 24 � With environment degradation being a raging issue after the National Green Tribunal�s (NGT) ban on coal mining in Meghalaya, a private University has invited renowned wildlife expert Mike Pandey for the Institute�s convocation address. Pandey, a Kenyan citizen, of Indian origin, is known the world over for his passionate work to protect the environment and so Martin Luther Christian University (MLCU) �decided to invite him� for their convocation slated for August 26 and strengthen environment protection in the the North East. The University in its last convocation invited The Dalai Lama here who during his stay also interacted with a large number of people in the State. Vice Chancellor of the University RG Lyngdoh said that the University thought it fit to bring in an expert like Pandey and learn from him about issues related to the environment. �We would be able to learn from his years of experience in protecting the wildlife and the environment and he would be meeting several people during his stay here,� Lyngdoh said. The University would also be holding an open discussion on August 25 and the open forum would talk about ways to protect the environment. �We would be summing up the discussions and coming up with recommendations so that it could be submitted to the State,� Lyngdoh said. He further added that through Pandey, who is also part of several organisations including Green Peace, would be able to raise the environment issue of Meghalaya at the international arena. Issues relating to the environment have been a raging subject ever since the NGT banned coal mining in April 17 this year. Several coal miners and Congress legislators have been demanding that the ban imposed by NGT in Meghalaya must be removed through a Presidential decree as Meghalaya is a special-status State.
