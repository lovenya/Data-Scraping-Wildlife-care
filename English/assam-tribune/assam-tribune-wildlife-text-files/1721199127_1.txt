GUWAHATI, Dec 7 - State�s RTI-cum-environment activist Rohit Choudhury today received the prestigious Sanctuary Wildlife Service Award of the Sanctuary Nature Foundation for the year 2018. The Sanctuary Nature Foundation, while naming Choudhury for the award, has described him as the �quintessential bookworm,� who spends his days navigating India�s labyrinthine judicial system, dodging bullets � both literal and figurative, to win legal battles for conservation. Choudhury, born and brought up at Bokakhat in the State, has made rich contributions to the State�s rich and threatened biodiversity, which is both unique and unsung, said the Sanctuary Foundation. A wildlife activist, Choudhury deploys the powerful Right to Information Act (RTI) to protect the biodiverse landscapes of the Kaziranga National Park, Manas National Park and a host of lesser-known protected areas. He is working to put a halt to the unregulated dumping of garbage from Guwahati city in the Ramsar Site of Deepor Beel; fighting the unlawful diversion of the Beki river in the core of the Manas National Park at the National Green Tribunal; and petitioning against the destruction of prime elephant habitats in the Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong landscape by illegal mining operations. His work on the latter resulted in the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) ordering a ban on all mining activities in the concerned landscape. He is best known for his heroic fight against the Numaligarh Refinery for the latter�s blocking an elephant corridor. Choudhury still continues undaunted, despite threats in his mission. The Sanctuary Wildlife Awards were instituted by the Sanctuary Nature Foundation in the year 2000 to recognise and draw national attention to the contributions of individuals working for the protection of wildlife and natural habitats in India. This year, the Foundation has named bio-piracy activist and food-sustainability advocate Vandana Shiva for the Lifetime Service Award, and tiger conservationist and scientist Imran Siddiqui, grassroot conservationist Iho Mitapo, tiger defender Govardhan Meena and marine conservationist Puja Mitra also for the Wildlife Service Awards. The Foundation has also named student and environmentalist Maitreya Sukumar for the Young Naturalist Award and Nikita Pimple for the Green Teacher Award for this year. The awards were presented at a function held at the National Centre for Performing Arts, Mumbai today.
