GUWAHATI, Dec 19 - �History of civilisation in a sense is the history of man�s association with animals but somehow since mechanisation developed and became an integral part of our lives, the sole dependence on animals has considerably weakened and animals that were found to be indispensable are being ignored,� opined Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde. He said this while addressing an orientation programme on protection of wildlife being organised by the Judicial Academy, Assam in collaboration with WWF-India at the Assam Administrative Staff College, Khanapara here today. Chief Justice Bobde said the environment is an intricate web, deeply interconnected and fascinating beyond imagination. �It has wonders we do not see in the world of mechanisation, computerisation and artificial intelligence,� he said. �After domestication, even the wild animals have played an important part in the civilisation. Cattle and bulls have been used for centuries. With the reduction of our dependence on animal for ourselves and our purposes, we have begun to ignore animals and their existence did not matter to us,� he said. He further said it is difficult to stop the scientific advancement but �we can, we should and we must� restrict the use of such invention to save wildlife. �We must ensure that these huge earth-moving machines and saws that can log down forests don�t fall in the hands that abuse them,� he added. The Chief Justice also observed that poachers and persons engaged in illegal wildlife trade are also connected to other illegal trades like narcotic drugs, gun running and other illegal international activities. �Many citizens of our country want to preserve the wildlife and environment but they do not know how to do it,� he added. Delighted to be part of the programme, Chief Justice Bobde said such programmes have significance and should be organised often. Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Judge of Supreme Court of India; Justice AK Goswami, Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court; Justice Ajit Singh (retired), Lokayukta of Odisha; Justice N Kotiswar Singh, Chief Justice (acting) of Gauhati High Court and other judges of Gauhati High Court were also present in the session.
