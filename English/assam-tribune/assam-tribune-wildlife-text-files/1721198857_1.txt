JAMUGURIHAT, Oct 15 ï¿½ The Assam Government vide a notification had included a vast area of the northern side of the Brahmaputra river in Kaziranga National Park (KNP) as its sixth addition. The main purpose of this inclusion was to safeguard the lives of the wild animals of the park along with an intention to provide fodder to them. But the incidents of the last few years have proved beyond doubt this sixth addition has miserably failed to protect the wild animals, especially during the rainy season. For example, rhinos, deer, elephants etc., often come to this area, which includes Panpur, Gamiripal, Thulatika, Koraiyani, Chilalmari, Bharali Chapari, etc., and poachers too lay traps to capture and kill these rare animals, specially rhinos and deer. The recent encounter between the security forces and the poachers at Ghiladharimukh is enough to establish the fact that wild animals are not safe in this area. The sixth addition from Kaliabhomorah to Lohitmukh, Gohpur is the area where these wild animals can feed and roam freely, but the security of these animals is in danger as poachers outnumber forest guards, and the sophisticated weapons used by the poachers are no match to the outdated 303 rifles of the guards. If the Forest department does not take proper steps to safeguard the wild animals, it will become a happy hunting ground for the poachers, and the lives of the rare animals will be in great danger, people here have opined.
