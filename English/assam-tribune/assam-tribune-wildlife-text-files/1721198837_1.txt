JONAI, Feb 3 � Despite being endowed with enormous bio- diversities with numerous perennial streams with evergreen forest covers, the Poba Reserve Forest (RF) � gazetted way back in 1924 � is yet to be declared as a wildlife sanctuary, disgracing the demand raised by the local people along with environmentalists of the State. The people here including NGO members, student union leaders and senior citizens have criticized the inaction of the State Government and the indifferent role of its Forest Minister over the important issue. Mention may be made here that a number of organisations including AASU, TMPK (Mising), Jonai unit of NGO Nature�s Beckon and others have handed over a memorandum to the Forest Minister, Rockybul Hussain demanding immediate declaration of the Poba RF as wildlife sanctuary, during his recent Dhemaji visit. Located at Jonai town outskirts, Poba RF covers entire eastern part while it covers a large portion of Ruksin forest range under East Siang forest division in Arunachal. Covering an area of 10,221 hectares, the RF is a hub of all natural bounties as the numerous perennial streams flowing down from the foothill of Arunachal Pradesh present a model habitat of wildlife. The forest supports habitation of rare animals like wild boar, pigmy hog, spotted owl, spotted deer, leopard cat, fox and plants including endangered medicinal species and varied orchids besides the birds, reptiles and insects. Viewing its rich natural ecosystem and evergreen forest cover, the authority concerned has ascribed the Poba in the list of �rain forest�. The RF is also considered as a factor in restoring ecological condition of the region besides protecting entire Jonai area from the flood fury. Varied bio-diversity and rich natural flora make an emerging eco-tourism hotspot. Moreover, its rich natural endownment with scenic beauty is something with great tourism potential. Only 3 km south-east from Jonai town, the flora and fauna enriched by the mighty Brahmaputra could quench the thirst for natural beauty. Kobuchapori proposed RF, located between two rivulets of mighty Brahmaputra is merged with the RF where a sizeable plantation of teak and sishoo trees with charming grass land could cater to the tourists� thirst. �Trading in the various agro-horticultural products of Kobuchapori, we could uplift the fragile economic status of the local people which is an effective deterrent to deal a crushing blow to the illegal logging syndicate,� observed Jamini Doley, chairman of Kobuchapori Multi Cropping Society. Going by the vast eco-tourism potential in the RF, the authority concerned should undertake required steps to exploit the nature�s bounty so that economic up-gradation of people living in the back of the beyond parts of the State could be achieved without making further dent in the already degraded forest cover. The people have demanded implementation of the environmental-friendly schemes. �Making the best use of the aesthetic aspect of nature, we could not only generate profits but keep the productive and protective aspect of nature intact for the wellbeing of our posterity�, said Tukeswar Agarwall, the coordinator of NGO Nature�s Beckon here.
