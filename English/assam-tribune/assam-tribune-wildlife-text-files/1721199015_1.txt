GUWAHATI, Dec 4 - A wildlife exposure tour for school students living in villages near the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary was organised recently under the IRV2020 initiative that aims to achieve a rhino population of 3,000 in Assam by 2020. During the daylong programme, 70 students from seven schools of the fringe of Pobitora got the unique experience of visiting the core areas of the rhino sanctuary and experience first-hand rhino sighting from a close range. The event was collaboratively organised by the State forest department, WWF and two local NGOs of the area � SHIPA and PETA through a special support extended by Disney Conservation for conservation of rhinos in Pobitora WLS of Assam. �WWF India along with the partners of IRV2020 has been constantly working with the students from the fringe of the various rhino protected areas (PAs) of the State and trying to get them involved in conservation and for educating the young minds on the relevant aspects of rhino conservation over the years. The wildlife exposure programme for the students from the fringe of Pobitora WLS was identified as a critical need, as during previous school-based programmes it was learnt that very few of the students from the fringe have gone inside Pobitora,� a WWF official said. Following the identification of the need during 2014-2015, the exposure programmes were designed in consultation with the conservation partners and the school authorities and the present programme is under execution.
