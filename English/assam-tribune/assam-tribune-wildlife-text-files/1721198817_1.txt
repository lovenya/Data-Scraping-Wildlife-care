GUWAHATI, May 21 � While the stress of the Centre�s policy vis-�-vis tourism in protected forests and tiger reserves is on shifting the focus to the buffer zones from the core areas, yet it should not be construed as effecting a total ban on tourist footfall in the core zones. Sujit Banerji, Chairman of the Forest, Environment and Eco-tourism Committee and former Secretary, Tourism, Government of India, said this while addressing a seminar on tourism organized by the Tour Operators� Association of Assam at Hotel Brahmaputra Ashok today. Banerji, who was deliberating on the topic �Impact of tiger conservation on tourism with special significance to Kaziranga National Park�, said that apprehensions among tour operators were widespread in the wake of the Supreme Court�s recent ruling declaring the core areas of tiger reserves and protected areas as �inviolate� to provide a disturbance-free environment to the tiger, but that it would be incorrect to interpret it as a total ban on tourism in the core areas. �The core areas should be kept as free from human disturbance as possible but it does not mean total closing down of tourism there. But the main thrust, of course, is on shifting the attention to the buffer areas and also to enhance the forest cover on the buffer by providing financial assistance to the local landholders,� Banerji said. Expressing concern over the unbridled growth of tourism in close proximity to wildlife habitats across the country, Banerji said that the ministry was working on a mechanism to check the undesirable growth of tourist facilities as it would be unsustainable in the long run. �Places like Corbett Park and Kaziranga National Park are witnessing a mushrooming growth of tourist facilities which is not in consonance with long-term interests of both ecology and tourism� restoring the wildlife corridors of Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong is critical to the well-being of Kaziranga and consequently to the tourism that thrives on Kaziranga,� he said. Banerji felt that too much emphasis was being paid on tiger-tourism whereas the need was to encourage a wholesome experience involving forests, its varied wildlife, and their overall ambience. �Making wildlife tourism tiger-centric will do more harm than good,� he added. Banerji also made a strong pitch for making the local inhabitants stakeholders in eco-tourism, saying that it was the best way to make them realize the worth of the invaluable asset of forests and wildlife and prevent them from taking up activities detrimental to its interests.
