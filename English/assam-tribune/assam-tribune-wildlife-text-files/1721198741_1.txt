DHEMAJI, Nov 30 - Supporting the ongoing demand to grant wildlife sanctuary status to Poba Reserve Forest (RF) in Dhemaji district, Assam�s prominent wildlife and nature conservation organisation Nature�s Beckon in collaboration with Bornangkon Group of Guwahati organized a day-long programme at Tinmailghat (Jonai) on the right bank of Siang river on Saturday. The programme included fine arts representation on environment and bio-diversity besides discussion on the ecological role of reserve forests. Participating in the programme, eminent artists of the State including Hemanta Borpatragohain, Manshpratim Dutta, Humen Saikia, Chiranjiv Borgohain and many other drew pictures showing importance of reserve forests and other natural resources to save Mother Earth. The programme was followed by a discussion on wild resources available in Poba RF with its conservation measures. Members of Nature�s Beckon and other nature lovers, who focused on the flora and fauna of the RF took a pledge to intensify the ongoing movement to protect the remaining forest cover for conservation of bio-diversity in the area. The organizers also conducted signature campaign in support of demand for granting wildlife sanctuary status to the RF and took a decision to move the Central and State governments to upgrade the RF as a wildlife sanctuary. It may be mentioned here that Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who visited the flood-ravaged Jonai subdivision in Dhemaji district during July this year, assured the local people of taking an early initiative to declare the reserve forest (RF) under Dhemaji forest division as a wildlife sanctuary. Earlier, the Nature�s Beckon wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his immediate intervention in the matter. Declaration of Poba RF as WLS is a long-pending public demand of the local people, NGOs and student unions of Dhemaji. It is felt that the RF is protecting the entire Jonai subdivision in easternmost Dhemaji in north Assam bordering Arunachal Pradesh. There is a wild animal corridor at Poba linking D�Ering WLS and Dibru Saikhowa National Park and other natural forests of the region.
