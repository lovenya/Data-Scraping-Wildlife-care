MORIGAON, Jan 6 - The Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary located in Morigaon district has lately become a focal point of foreign and domestic tourists. This season, the sanctuary which is home to the world-famed one-horned rhinoceros and other animals, has witnessed a heavy turnout of tourists, especially from England, Switzerland and Belgium, compared to last year. The surge in tourist flow can be attributed to improved infrastructure, coupled with proper marketing system undertaken by the authorities concerned. According to Forest Department sources, from October 1 upto December 31, 2018, as many as 15,021 domestic and 276 foreign tourists visited the sanctuary. During the period under reference, revenue generation was recorded at Rs 28.93 lakh. Similarly in 2017, a total of 13,026 domestic tourists and 196 foreign tourists visited the sanctuary. Pobitora, it may be pertinent to add here, was named in memory of a Koch dynasty princess who died in the15th century. According to the census of 2017, there were 101 rhinos at Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. It was declared as a wildlife sanctuary in 1998. Additionally, Pobitora is a paradise for avian species. Myriad species of aquatic as well as woodland birds flock here and 214 species were spotted last year. Atleast, 80 species of butterfly have been recorded in Pobitora thus far. Leopards too are seen in the Raja Mayong Hills. The tiger census of 2000 showed the absence of big cats in Pobitora, but recorded 13 leopards. However, the sanctuary has been facing a serious flood-related problem since the past several years. Several areas have already been eroded due to flood-induced erosion. The local people are of the view that a proper flood management system is the need of the hour to save flora and fauna of the sanctuary. �At the same time, we need improved tourism infrastructure in order to woo more foreign and domestic tourists, which will benefit the people,� they observed while sharing inputs with this Correspondent.
