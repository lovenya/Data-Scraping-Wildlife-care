TEZPUR, July 4 - Encroachment by suspected Bangladeshi immigrants, poaching of wildlife following a nexus of poachers with forest department officials and erosion caused by the Brahmaputra are posing a serious threat to the very existence of the Burhachapori wildlife sanctuary. The wildlife sanctuary � a protected area under Tezpur constituency � is located on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra in Sonitpur district. Declared a reserve forest in 1974, it became a sanctuary in 1995. This wildlife sanctuary has several other key protected areas in its vicinity like Kaziranga National Park to the east, Orang National Park and Pobitora wildlife sanctuary to the west, Pakke-Nameri National Park to the north and the rich reserve forests of Karbi Anglong to the south, and acts as a corridor for migration of animals between Kaziranga and Orang, and has also been identified as a buffer zone of the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve. The rich ecosystem of Burhachapori, characterised by grasslands, woodlands and wetlands along with river islands, is home to numerous species of endangered mammals, reptiles and birds. Large mammals like Asiatic water buffalo, Royal Bengal tiger and elephants are found here. Besides, rhinos migrating among Kaziranga, Orang and Pobitora are often spotted in Burhachapori. The wet alluvial grassland sustains a large number of herbivores like sambar, barking deer and hog deer along with nocturnal species like pangolins, slow loris, porcupine and hare. Many rare species of small cats, civets, otters, pythons, turtles like Assam Roofed, Indian Roofed, Peacock Soft-shelled turtles, butterflies like Birdwing, Common Map, Crimson Rose are found in abundance. The wetlands function as breeding grounds for various local fish species and birds such as storks like Adjutant, Lesser Adjutant, White Stork, Black Necked Stork, Black Stork besides other birds like Large Whistling Teal, Herons, various kinds of raptors, and numerous grassland birds like the endangered Bengal Florican. Many migratory birds, including waterfowl, visit the wetlands every winter. There are records of large flocks of vultures visiting the sanctuary to feast on animal remains. The highly endangered Gangetic River Dolphins are still seen in waters of the Brahmaputra adjacent to Burhachapori. However, the serene beauty of this sanctuary has been severely hit, following massive encroachment by suspected Bangladeshis in nexus with a section of unscrupulous forest department officials. A forest official at Burhachapori wildlife sanctuary who did not wish to be named disclosed that illegal activities were taking place regularly in the sanctuary. A couple of years back, a mature rhino coming from Orang National Park had gone missing at Burhachapori sanctuary, and its carcass was later found, leading to sharp criticism from the people. It is alleged that though some influential forest officials were involved in the mysterious death and later recovery of the carcass of the rhino, and it was also known to the government, but due to political interference, no action was taken against the culprits. Moreover, lobbying among forest officials of the sanctuary, and nexus between illegal Bangladeshis and some forest officials have led to serious threat to the sanctuary. The forest official revealed that a huge chunk of the sanctuary has been encroached by illegal Bangladeshis. Moreover, every year during the summer and rainy season, massive erosion denudes the sanctuary. �But the most regrettable thing is that all these issue are yet to attract the attention of the Forest department,� he lamented.
