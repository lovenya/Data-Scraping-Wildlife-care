SILCHAR, July 6 - In good news for wildlife lovers, the Cachar Forest Division has obtained administrative approval for a wildlife rehabilitation centre in Barak valley. The Department of Finance, Government of Assam, has given administrative approval for Rs 10 crore for the rehabilitation centre to come up across 120 hectares of land at Rajnikhal inner-line reserve forest under Dholai constituency. �We shall start proceedings for calling tender and will be finalising the DPR soon,� said Cachar Divisional Forest Officer Sunny Deo Choudhury. Once the rehabilitation centre � much like the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) near the Kaziranga National Park � is set up here, it will help a great deal in keeping rare species like king cobra, hoolock gibbon, species of owls found in this part of the country, he said. Also, the centre will have all facilities, including a veterinary health centre and food processing unit for the animals together with a nature interpretation centre as well, Choudhury said. The Cachar DFO informed that work for the bio-diversity park has already commenced in a three-hectare area at the location. Expressing happiness over the development, Forest and Environment Minister Parimal Suklabaidya, talking to The Assam Tribune, said �This is a much awaited leap for which we have been striving for quite some time. We hope that clearance required for a zoo shall also be given soon. People of this region need to be attracted towards the rich bio-diversity areas enroute Mizoram as well, and the wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre is much needed, especially when rare species are found.�
