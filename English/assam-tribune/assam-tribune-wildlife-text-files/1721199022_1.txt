DIMAPUR, Dec 26 - Nagaland Forest department has appealed to the village councils of the State to make resolution for banning hunting of wild animals. It also appealed to the public, government officials, village councils, army and paramilitary personnel, students, NGOs and other stakeholders for protection of wildlife. In an appeal letter recently, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden Satya Prakash Tripathi stated that the survival of human beings and animals depends on forests as their basic needs in the form of food, water, and shelter are met from forests. In addition to these tangible benefits, forests play key role in carbon sequestration, amelioration of environment and climate change, he reminded. The department pointed out that with passage of time and increasing population, biotic pressure on forests has significantly increased. In Nagaland, it said, lion�s share (88.3%) of forests is under the control of individuals and communities and remaining 11.7% of the forests are under the control of the Government. Stating that the Government has very limited regulatory role in management of private forests, the letter said administration and people of the State had/have played an important role in protection and maintenance of forests in the form of Community Conservation Areas since time immemorial. Also, stating that the existence of wildlife is a good indicator of good forests and subsequently availability of timber, firewood, medicinal plants for human beings, it said Nagaland had been traditionally a hunting State since time immemorial. �Now, people are coming forward for protection of wildlife and they are rescuing wild animals and they are donating wild animals and birds which are kept in Nagaland Zoological Park, Rangapahar and Tragopan Breeding Centre, Kohima,� it noted. The department observed that with the efforts of the administration, people and different agencies of the government, NGOs etc., Amur Flacons (migratory birds) were well protected in the State during their migration in 2013 and onwards.
