PHAYENG (MANIPUR), Dec 29 - N Toyai Chakpa, chief of Phayeng village in Manipur�s Imphal West district, on Saturday said that he along with some villagers have spotted deer at their village forest after a gap of more than 50 years following regeneration and conservation of the forest. �This is a good sign for us,� says the 70-year-old village chief. �I saw deer last in our village forest before the forest was cleared. I was a child at that time.� Toyai was sharing traditions of the village during the State Environment department�s Climate Cell sponsored programme on �Traditional practices in climate change adaptation� at the village on Saturday. The Phayeng village chief expressed the need to conserve the wildlife coming out of their village forest which was developed through the intervention of the village elders since the early sixties. He said, the traditional village rules prohibit anyone from entering the forest area which covers more than 230 hectares. Besides, fines are imposed as penalty for entering the forest without permission or knowledge of the Land and Forest Protection Committee of the village. Similarly, hunting is also controlled. The villagers are allowed to hunt only once in a year in the name of Lai-Haraoba (Syvan deity worship). With a population of about 5,000 people, Phayeng, known for preserving indigenous culture and knowledge uses around nine per cent of village land area for settlement while 57 per cent is used for agriculture purpose and the balance 34 per cent is covered under forest. The Scheduled Caste village has become a �model carbon positive eco-village�. The Climate Cell division of the State Environment department extends scientific inputs and support for better conservation activities in the village by planting fruit bearing trees, according to Dr T Brajakumar, Deputy Director of the department. Prof W Nabakumar, former head of Anthropology department, Manipur University chaired and moderated the session which was attended by environmentalists and scholars from Manipur University and Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Manipur campus.
