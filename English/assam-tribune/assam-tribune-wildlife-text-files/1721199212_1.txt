GUWAHATI, July 10 - An inter-agency coordination meeting convened by Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Guwahati, at the Assam forest headquarters here today called for enhanced coordination among all the enforcement agencies, especially in matters of technical surveillance and cyber crimes, with regard to wildlife contraband products. �This is imperative due to the fact that only a few enforcement agencies have the capacity of technical and cyber crime surveillance. A nodal officer of the police or the other agencies can be designated who can be approached directly by the other enforcement agencies for relevant information,� a WCCB source said. As enforcement agencies are facing multifarious difficulties during conduct of trials in wildlife crime cases resulting in a very low conviction rate, the meeting stressed that there should be proper coordination among all the enforcement agencies to avail quality legal services. It also called for establishing a Wildlife Crime Control Cell by the police and forest departments. Taking into account the growing targeting of various fauna � large as well as small � by organised networks to meet international demand for wildlife articles, the meeting observed that the region is also a transit for smuggling of wildlife sourced from other parts of the country to international destinations. �Assam is especially vulnerable on these counts, more so for harbouring sizeable population of many endangered animals close to international borders. This warrants a matching and well-coordinated response by all the enforcement agencies,� the meeting noted. The meeting held under the chairmanship of Ranjana Gupta, Chief Wildlife Warden, Assam, was attended among others by Tilottoma Verma, Additional Director, WCCB, and LR Bishnoi, ADGP, CID, Assam Police. Officers from DRI, Customs, ED, SIB, CISF, SSB, BSF, Assam forest, Arunachal Pradesh forest and Nagaland forest departments were present at the meeting.
