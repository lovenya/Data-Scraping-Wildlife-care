DIBRUGARH, July 1 - Dehing Patkai, the name is in high circulation these days, but for all the wrong reasons. It is being used to highlight coal mining, wildlife poaching, forest destruction, and what not. So this all called for a closer look into the issue. In the meanwhile, the demand for the original 500 sq km Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary is now gaining currency. Those who have been associated with the rainforest conservation movement since 1994 will recall how the original protagonists were on a lengthy, multi-modal agitation path, demanding clubbing of three contiguous virgin rainforests into a single wildlife sanctuary. The reason being that this approximately 500 sq km territory of dense multi-layered rainforests was unique like the Amazon rainforest, and needed to be conserved for the country�s future generations of citizens. The agitation was led by a group of young nature lovers whose organisation was named Nature�s Beckon. On the front were its director, Soumyadeep Datta, the Late Popi Santana Bharali, and photography enthusiast, Mridupaban Phukan. Lending them support were a few journalists, both in print and in radio (those days, news TV channels did not exist). During the course of the agitation for the proposed Joidehing Wildlife Sanctuary � that was what the would be sanctuary was referred to � the volunteers would take to road blockades, street plays, dharna and demonstrations and poster campaigns. Datta recalls he and his colleagues were arrested on numerous occasions, but the young crusaders stood their ground. In 2001, an International Rainforest Festival was also organised at Joypur in the Dibrugarh district. The then Assam Chief Minister, Tarun Gogoi, was in attendance. It was then that he committed himself to formally declare the sanctuary. In this meanwhile, the Government in 2003 notified a Elephant Reserve, reportedly at the behest of the then Joint Secretary (Forest), Assam, Dr Anwaruddin Choudhury. This �reserve� was to have a territorial jurisdiction over 937 square kilometres, spread across the then Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Sivasagar districts. Now, the interesting part is that Datta claims that a �Elephant Reserve� as notified in 2003 has no official status. Datta is a member of the Government of India�s Project Elephant Steering Committee. This committee is India�s highest body for elephant conservation. Obviously, the Elephant Reserve notification of 2003 was a smokescreen to muddy the rainforest conservation movement. However, following greater public participation in the movement, the Assam Government in 2004 finally notified a truncated wildlife sanctuary. Of the demanded 500 square kilometers, only 111.19 sq kms was notified as the sanctuary�s area, with segments from the three reserve forests of Dirak, Joypur and Upper Dehing. The name �Dehing Patkai�, instead of Joidehing, too was coined by the then Congress leaders. The campaigners decided to settle for this, with the contemplation that they would ask for the full 500 sq km at a future date. The best part about these three reserve forests is that these continue to be largely well-preserved rainforests, says Datta. �There is no forest village, no human dwelling, no encroachment.� He said the Assam Government now just need to issue the notification, because all the paper works and Central Government clearances are already on file. He added that if this is done now, �it would be a major success for nature conservation in the State.� And if this is done, a new Wildlife Division will also be created for effective conservation and maintenance activities. Presently, the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary is under the charge of the DFO, Digboi Territorial Division. Datta said the coal and other activities at Saleki near Margherita is a completely different issue, and is for the government to sort out. Saleki is a �proposed� reserve forest (PRF). All these years since 2007, this PRF was not made a full reserve forest, neither by the Tarun Gogoi government nor by the Sarbananda Sonowal government. He maintained that even after the notification of the full 500 square kilometres of the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, the Saleki area would be about 10 kms (9.19 kms) outside the sanctuary. Since the British Raj days, the erstwhile Assam Railways & Trading Company was into coal mining in the area, including what is now Saleki. Coal India Limited was continuing the mining since 1973, on the strength of a mining lease, which expired in 2003. It was after 2003 that Coal India Limited applied for mining renewal, but continued without the formal licence, till 2013. In the meanwhile, Coal India Limited put in a reminder to the Government that its mining lease renewal is pending and carried on extracting coal from Saleki, till October 2019. All this while, parallel (illegal) coal mining also took place, allegedly with political and administrative blessings. Who did these illegalities is a matter of criminal investigation, if the government wants to. It is also alleged that a few tea plantations also came up in the area. A departmental investigation is called for, here too. So the government now just has to evict the illegal activities. Due to the anti-CAA movement and the Covid-19 related lockdown, coal mining is not happening in Saleki. The illegal acts, plantations etc., can be evicted and stopped by the government. Question is, if and when?
