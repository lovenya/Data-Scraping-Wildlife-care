MORIGAON, July 13 - Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, the centre of bio-diversity of central Assam has been hit by current wave of Brahmaputraï¿½s flood forcing the wild animals including one-horned rhinos to go to nearby highland today. According to the Ranger of Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, a total of 70 per cent of areas were submerged by the floodwater today. The sanctuary, which has the highest density of Indian one-horned rhinos in 46 square kilometres of land is nearest to the State capital Guwahati. The sanctuary has more than 100 rhinos, 1400 wild buffaloes, thousands of wild hog and deer besides several species of snakes. The Forest Protection Force has resorted to 24 hours vigil in the sanctuary to curb rhino poaching there. Meanwhile, several link roads to and from Pobitora sanctuary were threatened by the floodwater in different points. There is every possibility of damage of infrastructure of Pobitora sanctuary by the Brahmaputra flood as the rising water entered the sanctuary in different ways and the indications hint at a possible catastrophe in the sanctuary.
