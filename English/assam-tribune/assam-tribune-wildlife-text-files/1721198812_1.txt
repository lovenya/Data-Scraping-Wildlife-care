NAGAON, Nov 1 - P Shiva Kumar, Director of Kaziranga National Park, ceremonially opened the Katakhal area of Laokhuwa Wildlife Sanctuary for tourists today. Laokhuwa Wildlife Sanctuary, which was pitchforked into the limelight as a breeding spot for the world famous one-horned rhino of Kaziranga National Park, attracted tourists from all over the country and even abroad due to its soothing greenery, besides the south bank of the mighty Brahmaputra.
