GUWAHATI, Oct 24 � For his resourcefulness and courage in rescuing a wild elephant stranded at the Pancharatna Reserve Forest in the Goalpara Division, Monomohan Das, Forester I was honoured with an individual prize on Tuesday at a function organized at the State Zoo here by the WWF-India and the Assam State Forest Department. The WWF-India and the State Forest Department presented two �WWF-Assam Forest Department Vanya Prani Mitra Awards� to 12 forest staff of the Assam State Forest Department for their exemplary service towards the protection of Assam�s wildlife. The awards were presented by Minister of Forest and Environment Rockibul Hussain. The award in the individual category carries a citation and a cash award of Rs 25,000 whereas the group award carries a citation and a cash award of Rs 5,000 to each of the 11 members of the group. It needs to be mentioned here that Das had also attended to other wildlife emergencies and crisis without hesitation and went out of his way to raise awareness among local communities for conservation of wildlife. �I�ve been working for wildlife conservation for the past decade and I�m really happy that I�ve been selected for this award. Forests will exist only if the wildlife within them is protected and I hope to continue to do my bit to ensure this,� he said. A team of 11 frontline staff from the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park was given the team award for showing great courage by bravely engaging with armed poachers while on a patrol in the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park. In the resultant encounter, a .303 rifle, an axe and four bags were recovered from the location and the poaching was averted. Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said, �These awards will create a positive atmosphere for wildlife conservation in Assam and boost the morale of our frontline forest staff. In spite of the many difficult challenges facing them, the forest staff is doing a great job and this is reflected in the praise our conservation work is getting from around the world.� Speaking on the occasion, Ravi Singh, CEO and secretary general, WWF-India added: �I thank the Assam Forest Department for joining WWF-India in this initiative to recognize the dedicated work of the frontline staff through these awards�. VK Vishnoi, IFS, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) and Head of Forests, Assam and Suresh Chand, IFS and PCCF, Wildlife Assam and Chief Wildlife Warden, Assam were also present at the event. �It is difficult working for wildlife conservation in the field. With the help of my team�s efforts we have ensured zero poaching in Orang in the last one year by thwarting a number of attempts made by poachers. My whole team is thankful for this award and for the help WWF-India provided in the field�, added Chakrapani Roy, Forest Ranger, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park on behalf of his team. These awards, constituted jointly by WWF-India and Assam Forest Department, continue the long standing partnership between the two in working for the conservation of Assam�s rich wildlife, especially under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) programme. Under this programme, previously 18 rhinos have been successfully translocated from Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Kaziranga National Park to Manas National Park, where they are monitored regularly. In addition, WWF-India is also collaborating with the Assam Forest Department for managing human elephant conflict and tiger conservation including monitoring tigers, co-predators and prey in different Protected Areas and Forest Divisions of the State. WWF-India which has experience of over four decades in the field, has made its presence felt through a sustained effort not only towards nature and wildlife conservation, but sensitising people by creating awareness through capacity building and enviro-legal activism.
