GUWAHATI, Sept 19 - Chairing a review meeting of the Forest department�s Compensatory Aforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) at his conference room in Janata Bhawan today, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal urged the Forest department to take proactive steps for conservation of forest areas and wildlife through reserve forests and initiate campaigns to generate awareness among the masses for protection of forests. The Chief Minister also directed CAMPA to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for setting up the Assam Institute of Wildlife at Guijan near Dibru-Saikhowa Reserve Forest in Tinsukia district. He also said that State specific courses must be taught at the Institute like man-animal conflict, wildlife protection with the help of the community etc., which would go a long way in nurturing trained manpower for wildlife protection in the State. Saying that the CAMPA�s functioning must be highlighted through awareness campaigns in all the districts, Sonowal directed the department to initiate action for tree plantation at government lands for expanding the forest cover. �People must be made aware about their roles in protecting the forests so that the government can initiate plans with the help of the society in increasing the forest cover and a sense of ownership of the forests can be generated among the public,� the Chief Minister stated. Urging the CAMPA authorities to take measures for constructing highlands for the animals in Kaziranga for providing shelter to the flood-affected animals, Sonowal said that highlands must be built in the natural corridors of the wild animals so that they can take shelter during floods. He also directed for completing the construction of the ongoing highlands within February 2018 and said that he would himself visit Kaziranga National Park in February to see the status of construction.
