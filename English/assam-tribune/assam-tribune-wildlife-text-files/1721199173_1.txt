KALAIGAON,Aug 18 - The Udalguri district administration officially felicitated Paran Das, Senior Manager of Nonaipara Tea Estate (under Goodricke group) and wildlife activist Pramesh Rabha of Borigaon village for their contribution in the field of wildlife conservation with special reference to �Human-Elephant Conflict� in Udalguri district since the last couple of years. The felicitation was organised in sync with the 73rd Independence Day celebration. Dilip Kumar Das, Deputy Commissioner of Udalguri felicitated Paran Das with a phulam gamusa and citation while Ripen Daimari, MCLA of BTC felicitated Pramesh Rabha with a phulam gamusa and citation. It may be pertinent to mention here that Udalguri district has been recognised as a hot spot of man-elephant conflict. Thus far,123 people and 50 wild elephants have lost their lives since 2012 in the district. Nonaipara Tea Estate, it me be mentioned, is home to a number of wild animals such as elephants, leopards, bison, spotted deer, wild boar and innumerable species of birds, besides the great Indian hornbill. The tea garden strictly follows the Wildlife Protection Act, which defines wild animals and prohibits hunting.There are three natural elephant corridors passing through the said tea estate,with herds of pachyderms often claiming right of way and at times causing considerable damage to the tea bushes, including deaths of several workers. Over the years, the tea garden authority has not only learnt to adjust with the elephants and other wildlife, but also evolve strategies that have led to an almost peaceful co-existence with them. It is widely known that Paran Das has gone out of his way to rescue many wild animals in distress situations, including three Burmese pythons, one wild elephant calf and a Javan ferret badger. Nonaipara Tea Estate under the supervision of its Senior Manager Paran Das has also been supporting forest officials and frontline forest staff for the protection of wildlife. Similarly, wildlife activist Pramesh Rabha has been consistently working to rescue wild animals. He has also been instrumental in minimising human-elephant conflict since 2008. Of great help to the forest and civil administration over the years, MK Sarma, DFO of Dhansiri Forest Division congratulated both Paran Das and Pramesh Rabha in their never- ending mission of nature and wildlife conservation.
