AGARTALA, Feb 26 - An action plan has been submitted to make Rowa Wildlife Sanctuary, located in Tripura�s North district and which is home to over 50 species of birds, much more attractive . A lot of butterfly species are also found in the sanctuary. Barking deers, snakes, porcupine and Himalyan black scurriles are also available in the so-far neglected wildlife sanctuary. Some waterbodies make it more attractive for the nature lovers. The Sanctuary spreading over about one km can become a must-visit spot if proper planning and implementation is done. Of late, there have been an upward trend in the footfalls of nature lovers. �In the entire North district, Rowa Wildlife Sanctuary is considered as a green spot�. It looks like vermilion on the forehead of woman! We must protect the rich biodiversity of the sanctuary�, said District Forest Officer (DFO), North district, Jayakrishnan JK. �We have already submitted an action plan to make it more attractive by protecting the rich biodiversity and ecological balance in the area�, he said, adding that the entire area of the sanctuary would be fenced to prevent encroachment and other illegal activities. �As part of the action plan, the Forest department has sanctioned Rs 10 lakh to undertake the fencing work at the earliest,� he stated. Habitation plantation would be raised in one hectare area inside the wildlife sanctuary so that wild animals feel comfortable. �Some spots are highly exposed in the Sanctuary due to illegal activities. Now, a revival plan has been chalked out and we will do whatever possible to bring back the old days for the sanctuary�, he said. Wildlife Warden of Rowa Wildlife Sanctuary Neeraj K Chanchal said footfall of nature lovers in the sanctuary is growing every passing day. �It will go up further if the action plan is implemented properly�, he added.
