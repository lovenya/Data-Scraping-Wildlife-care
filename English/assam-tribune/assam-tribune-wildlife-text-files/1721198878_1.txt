GOLAKGANJ, Dec 30 ï¿½ The people of Dhubri district have alleged that rare varieties of wildlife found here are on the verge of extinction due to wanton killing of such animals. The district being a natural habitat of wild animals, there had been proposals to create a mini zoo and park for these animals. But due to the indifferent attitude of the authorities concerned, these proposals never materialized and eventually, the killing of animals increased. The absence of a wildlife wing in the forest department and negligence of concerned authorities have also been encouraging poaching in the district. According to sources in the Dhubri Forest Division, the animals are mainly killed with the help of firearms, but other means such as poisoning, electrocution and the traditional bow and arrows are also being used. They said of late in most the forest areas of the district, birds like peacock, white-winged wood duck, pheasant, dove, drake gander, kingfisher, etc., and many other rare species of animals have come under tremendous pressure due to poaching. Poaching disrupts breeding and even changes migration patterns. Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have appealed to the people of the district not to encourage the sale of meat of wild animals and at the same time, motivate others not to kill the innocent animals, because they too have an equal right to live in this world like human beings. Shyamal Sanyal, chief convenor of the Dhubri Bikash Aru Pragati Mancha, a social organization of Dhubri town, demanded establishment of a wildlife wing under the forest department, and that Salkocha, Rokakhata, Alomganj forest areas be kept reserved for wild animals, and if possible, the proposal for the mini zoo and park should be materialized so that wanton killing of animals is stopped, and these innocent animals are protected properly. Otherwise, the days are not far when the district will become completely devoid of all these rare animals, he said.
