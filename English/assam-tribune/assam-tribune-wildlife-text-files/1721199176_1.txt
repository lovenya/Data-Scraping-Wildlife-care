GUWAHATI, Aug 7 - A seminar titled �Conservation of Wildlife & Prevention of Wildlife Crime� was organised at Frontier Headquarter of BSF, Patgaon, Guwahati in association with officials of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Guwahati on Tuesday to sensitise Border Security Force personnel on the magnitude and impact of wildlife poaching and illegal wildlife trade and to highlight the inevitable need for inter-agency co-operation for eradicating this threat to wildlife. Piyush Mordia, Inspector General, BSF Guwahati Frontier delivered the inaugural address and underlined the importance of the seminar. Mordia also said that illegal wildlife trade is reported to be the third largest global illegal trade after narcotics and human trafficking. It is a lucrative business for criminal syndicates because the risk involved is low compared to other crimes and high profits can be generated. Illegal wildlife trade hinders social and economic development, causes potential economic loss for governments, and has direct consequences on the rule of law, national and international security and the environment, Mordia said, appealing to the BSF personnel to put forward strong and candid views on how agencies can coordinate and formulate a long-term strategy for protection of forest and wild animals. The IG of BSF also empathised that prevention of wildlife crime is very important. Some anti-national elements do try to smuggle wild animals on the Indo-Bangladesh border, but due to alertness of BSF troops they do not succeed, he added. K Sarma, Assistant Director, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Guwahati spoke on conservation of wildlife and prevention of wildlife crime. JK Rudola, DIG, Frontier HQ, BSF Patgaon, Guwahati spoke about the need to upgrade technology of current systems to detect wildlife crime in a more effective manner. He also spoke about the need to strengthen the wildlife forensic capacity of the country and suggested mobile forensic labs for identifying wildlife contraband in transit. The seminar was attended by 55 officials of BSF Frontier Guwahati.
