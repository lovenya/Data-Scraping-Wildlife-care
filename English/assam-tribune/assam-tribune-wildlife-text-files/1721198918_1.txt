GUWAHATI, Oct 7 � �A silent revolution is taking place in wildlife conservation efforts in Assam, thanks to the dedicated and sincere efforts of the forest personnel,� said Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi at the State-level function held on the occasion of the 59th Wildlife Week at the Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra here today. According to an official press release, the Chief Minister said that the slew of conservation efforts have led to the rise in the rhino, elephant, tiger and other wildlife population in the State. He praised the forest guards and other officials of the Forest Department for this achievement. The Chief Minister also made an appeal to the media to highlight the success attained by the Forest Department in its conservation bids to boost the morale of the personnel of the department, who are working under adverse conditions to protect wildlife from poachers. �Such conservation efforts are not seen elsewhere,� he asserted. Gogoi said the Government has made the laws stringent by amending the 1972 legislation in this regard. He asserted that the legal provisions would be more stringent to deter the poachers in the coming days. Expressing concern over the growing man-elephant conflicts, Gogoi said the depredations by wild elephants in human settlements have been due to shrinkage in wildlife habitats and emphasised on the need to bring an end to such conflicts.
