GUWAHATI, Nov 17 � The State Government has proposed structures like animal underpasses, ecoducts/animal overpass and overpass/flyover in four potential animal corridors of the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) as long-term measures to make the National Park- stretch of the national highway 37 wildlife-friendly. This has been revealed by the proposal submitted by the State Chief Secretary as an annexure to his affidavit before the National Green Tribunal on the issue. It needs mention here that the State Government has also proposed diversion of the NH-37 in this stretch to save the KNP wildlife. The above structures are meant to protect the four potential corridors � Kanchanjuri-Burhapahar (4km), East Haldibari-Baguri (5km), Borjuri-Panbari Beat (5km) and Burhapahar-Deosarnala (4km), with their estimated width, against habitat losses, human settlements and encroachments. Planning animal passages through various structures in all these corridors needs priority to reduce the bulk of the mortalities of wild animals, said the proposal. These corridors are very frequently used by all kinds of wild animals of the National Park during flood as well as in other seasons. The KNP has the unique and dynamic alluvial grassland habitats, which are maintained through floods and river actions of the Brahmaputra and its associated tributaries. Here, landmass erosion and formation of alluvial deposits are a continuous and ongoing process for habitat changes. The changing habitat attributes do influence the animal communities to move between grassland and woodlands for forage needs and getting escape terrain to avoid high flood stresses. The NH-37, running parallel on the southern boundary of the KNP between Bokakhat and Ghorakati range, divides the landscape into north and south by low-lying grassland of the KNP with the elevated Karbi Anglong Hill respectively. The collision of wildlife on the highway in this area can be distinguished in two seasons � the first being the rainy season (June to August and some time till September/October), and the second road fatalities occurs in the post-rainy season period. On top of the short-term measures like putting up speed breakers/ rumble strips to control speed and road signages to reduce the highway-related mortalities of the KNP wildlife, the Government has envisioned steps like � limiting speed to 30 km per hour, conspicuously displaying the road signages at the animal crossing points, installation of speed detection devices and speed cameras in all sensitive stretches of the Highway, among others.
