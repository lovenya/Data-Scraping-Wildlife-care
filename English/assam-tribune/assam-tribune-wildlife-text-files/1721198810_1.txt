BISWANATH CHARIALI, June 28 - In view of the current flood scenario, WWF-India has provided much-needed veterinary support in the form of emergency medicines, basic surgical items, animal cages for rescue operation and items for preparing temporary animal shelters to the Biswanath Wildlife Division. The said items were handed over to Mukut Chandra Das, Divisional Forest Officer of Biswanath Wildlife Division under Kaziranga National Park today at the DFO�s office in Biswanath Chariali. Every year during the seasonal deluge on the North Bank of the river Brahmaputra, i.e., the sixth addition of Kaziranga National Park�s Biswanath Wildlife Division, numerous wildlife species like barking deer, hog deer, swamp deer, hog badgers, porcupines, different species of reptiles, civets and birds etc., are adversely affected due to the rising water level inside the park which forces them to stray and come into conflict with humans or are maimed or killed by speeding vehicles on the roads. Fortunately, conservation NGOs like WWF-India, WTI, Aaranyak, TSA, AWRRO, local volunteers and veterinarians from the State Animal Husbandry Department work tirelessly round the clock not only for the rescue and treatment of wildlife in distress, but also for the local communities and domestic livestock at the same time. In this regard, WWF-India has been working with the local communities for creating awareness during the food season by organising interactive workshops for veterinarians working in and around Kaziranga National Park in collaboration with other NGOs, providing support for fringe area vaccination of domestic livestock, screening of wildlife diseases in collaboration with the College of Veterinary Science, AAU, Khanapara and also providing support to the Forest Department during the seasonal floods. WWF-India was hopeful that the veterinary support will help the veterinarians and Forest Department personnel during rescue operations. They asked the local people to cooperate and support the forest staff and veterinarians during such operations for the welfare of the displaced animals.
