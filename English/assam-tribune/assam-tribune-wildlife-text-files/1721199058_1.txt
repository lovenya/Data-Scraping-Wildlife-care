KAZIRANGA, March 4 - The role of the student community in the conservation of wildlife and nature is very important as they are the ones who could become responsible stakeholders and play an active role while protecting nature and forest from anthropogenic activities. This was the observation made by Mubina Akhtar, secretary of Kaziranga Wildlife Society during the observation of World Wildlife Day on Friday organised by the Rising Sun English School, Kohora on the school premises. Initiating the deliberations, KWS secretary Akhtar said that if we need to go for aggressive protective measures for wildlife, then we must involve the younger generation as they were the ones who can take creative measures for wildlife protection. Impressed with the deliberation of important topics like diversity of aquatic animals of North East India, biodiversity of Assam, wetland of Assam and the avifauna of the sub-Himalayan region, spelled out by Dona Das, Nitin Dutta, Ankita Bora and Udipta Akash Das respectively, the KWS secretary expressed her happiness with the way these students had come forward to discuss about important environmental issues which had become the matter of concern for everyone. Sharing his own experience in many foreign countries, a former director of the Soil Conservation Department, Indrajit Dutta said that course material of the other countries were made in such a way that it had many subjects concerning environmental issues which motivated the young generation to become responsible stakeholders for the conservation of nature and wildlife. President of the Rising Sun School committee, Dilip Das said that people of Kaziranga, especially the young generation had become responsible stakeholders in protection of wildlife surrounding their places of living and were playing an active role during floods while rescuing animals.
