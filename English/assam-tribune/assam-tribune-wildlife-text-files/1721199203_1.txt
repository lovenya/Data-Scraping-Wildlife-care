BISWANATH CHARIALI, July 28 - On the occasion of Global Tiger Day to be celebrated tomorrow (July 29), TRAFFIC (an international organisation working to curb poaching and illegal trade of tigers) has announced the winners of �Canines for Felines�, a special contest for wildlife sniffer dogs (popularly called Super Sniffers) trained under a TRAFFIC and WWF-India programme in India. Among the winners, wildlife sniffer dog �Quarmy� from Biswanath Wildlife Division, Assam won a special prize for combating wildlife crime. He and his handlers Lakhmi Nandan Baruah and Johnson Teron were trained at the NTCD, BSF Academy, Gwalior in 2017. In a period of merely two years of deployment, Quarmy has helped in solving several wildlife crime cases and provided crucial leads to enforcement agencies. The inaugural �Canines for Felines� competition received 12 entries from across India. Between them, the 12 Super Sniffer contestants helped enforcement agencies in solving 131 wildlife cases. The winners were chosen based on their impact on tiger-related cases while the Special Prize was awarded based on the wildlife sniffer dog�s overall contribution towards curbing wildlife crime. The certificates for the winners and their prizes will be sent to the respective forest departments. It needs mention here that to help curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade, TRAFFIC with support from WWF-India launched the wildlife sniffer dog training programme in 2008 in India. Since then, it has trained 66 wildlife sniffer dog squads deployed in 19 States across India. These dogs have helped in solving over 350 wildlife crime cases involving the seizure of wildlife products. The Global Tiger Day, also called International Tiger Day is celebrated every year on July 29 globally to raise awareness about tiger conservation. It was started in 2010 at the St. Petersburg Tiger Summit.
