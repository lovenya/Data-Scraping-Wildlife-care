Guwahati,
Aug. 22: Aaranyak, a non-governmental organisation for preservation and
restoration of wildlife and environment, has expressed concern over the
killing of conservation worker Esob Ali in Morigaon district by
unidentified assailants.

Ali, a resident under Mayong police
station of Morigaon district, died at Guwahati Medical College Hospital
(GMCH) today. At least five persons attacked Ali with sharp weapons
when he was returning home from Buraburi market near Pobitora wildlife
sanctuary on Thursday.

Ali was admitted to GMCH in a critical condition on Thursday night.

Secretary
general of Aaranyak Bibhab Kumar Talukdar said Ali, for past 15 years,
had been assisting the conservation and protection agencies functioning
in Pobitora wildlife sanctuary to protect rhinos.

He assisted
forest and police officials with vital intelligence inputs on poachers'
movement, their arms and ammunition and the like. This saved the lives
of at least 15 rhinos in and around the wildlife sanctuary.
