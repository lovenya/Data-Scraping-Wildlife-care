WPSI’s Wildlife Awareness Campaign for Tibetans



16 Jan. 2007
WPSI’s
Wildlife Awareness Campaign for Tibetans has received an overwhelming
response in the large Tibetan settlements in South India. In January
this year, thousands of people gathered at the Sera Je Monastery, in
the Tibetan Refugee Settlement of Bylakuppe in Karnataka, to attend the
Hayagriva Initiation by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. On 11 January
2007, the Wildlife Protection Society of India used the occasion to
conduct a Wildlife Awareness Campaign to an audience of more than 8,500
Tibetans. Our Project Officer, Mr. Ngawang Rabgyal, gave a
presentation, showed a film and distributed thousands of brochures on
the occasion.


The Tibetan-language WPSI
brochure - which urges Tibetan people not to encourage the illegal
trade in tiger, leopard and otter skins and the
trade in raw shahtoosh wool - was also widely distributed during the
last day of the Dalai Lama’s teachings on 12 January 2007.



Interestingly, we have also learnt that text and photographs from
WPSI's campaign brochure have been reprinted in an education magazine
published by one of the biggest Khampa monasteries in Tibet, Sejey in
Sichuan Province.
