Dholbaha
(Hoshiarpur): Thanks to the wildlife officials’ apathy and neglect, in
a short span of one month, the apparent rampant poaching going on in
the Shiwalik hills of the state has yet claimed another life of the
denizen of these jungles, the endangered leopard.

This time, a
male adult leopard, about 6 feet 2 inches long, has met a tragic end
due to strangulation near here towards the Ram Tatwali forest stretch.
The feline, which died by inches with deep injuries inflicted around
its neck by the tightening of the steel wire, in an attempt to set
itself free, though uprooted the trap, but died of strangulation after
probably moving few yards from the site of trap-laying. The carcass,
which was found in the middle of the dense forest, was along with the
steel wire tightened around its neck.

Killing of leopard
(Panthera Pardus Fusca), an endangered species enlisted under
schedule-1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, is a non-baiable
offence with the perpetrator liable to be punished upto seven years of
rigorous imprisonment with a maximum penalty of Rs. 50, 000.

Though
officially, the wildlife authorities deny about these Shiwalik jungles
of the state as the abode of this magnificent big cat, but ground
evidences have proved this fact.
