More
than 50 tonnes of shark fins worth hundreds of thousands of pounds have
been exported from  Britain over the past two years, a Greenpeace

Campaigners are calling on the government to ban these exports which are fuelling the global demand for shark fin soup. 

The
majority of sharks in European and UK waters are being caught by
Spanish vessels, according to the report by the organisation’s

fin soup is considered a delicacy.
