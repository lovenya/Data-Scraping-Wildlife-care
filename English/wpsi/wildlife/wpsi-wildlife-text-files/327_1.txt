China's animal trade to bring more viral outbreaks: Experts

Â

The
animal-borne SARS virus 17 years ago was supposed to be a wake-up call
about consuming wildlife as food, but scientists say China's latest
epidemic indicates that the practice remains widespread and a growing
risk to human health.

Like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome), which was traced to bats and civets, the virus that has
killed dozens in China and infected almost 2,000 people is believed to
have originated in animals trafficked for food.

Final findings
are yet to be announced, but Chinese health officials believe it came
from wildlife sold illegally at a meat market in the central city of
Wuhan that offered everything from rats to wolf puppies and giant
salamanders.
