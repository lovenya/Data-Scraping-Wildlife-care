The
Maharashtra forest department is set to be the first state in India to
have a dedicated action plan for conservation of pangolins – the
world’s most trafficked animal.

Pangolins are listed in Schedule
I of India’s Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, implying the highest
degree of protection. The principal chief conservator of forests
(PCCF-wildlife) recently got nod from the state for its proposal to
form a study group to prepare a five-year conservation action plan for
pangolins. “We have been informed that the proposal has been accepted,”
said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF-wildlife, adding, “The committee will look
into aspects such as population estimation, distribution, habitat
protection and most importantly, illicit trafficking hotspots. Unlike
tigers and leopards, these are species that have never been in focus
despite having a huge ecological role.”

M Maranko, regional
deputy director (west), Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), said,
“Maharashtra will be the first state to have such a plan.
