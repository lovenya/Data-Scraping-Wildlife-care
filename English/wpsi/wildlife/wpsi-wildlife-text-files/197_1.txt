DRI seizes 8,000 kg of shark fins in Mumbai and Gujarat town 


 
3rd September 2018

The
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has smashed an international
wildlife smuggling racket with the seizure of about 8,000 kg of shark
fins in Mumbai and the coastal town of Veraval in Gujarat. Four
persons, including the mastermind, have also been arrested.

According
to the DRI, the consignments were meant to be illegally exported to
China and Hong Kong. The fins were procured from the seas along the
coasts of Ratnagiri and Mumbai in Maharashtra, and Veraval and Okha in
Gujarat.

They are used for preparing “shark fin” soup in China
and Vietnam. Usually served on special occasions such as weddings and
banquets, it is considered a luxury food item and is of immense
significance, with one bowl of soup costing at least $100.

Acting
on a tip-off that some exporters were indulging in the trans-border
smuggling of fins of various species of sharks, the agency mounted
surveillance and zeroed in on the suspects. The fins were to be
smuggled out on the pretext of exports of dried ray skins, dried marine
products, and fish maw, to evade detection.Read full story here
