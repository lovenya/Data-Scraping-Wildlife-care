India’s death fields: More animals electrocuted

 

5th July, 2017



Dozens of elephants, tigers, sloth bears, monkeys and flamingos
are being electrocuted in India’s farmlands, plantations, around human
settlements near and inside forests, as they come in contact with
poorly maintained power lines and electric wires.

While there
are guidelines to keep animals straying out of their shrinking habitats
safe, wildlife researchers said they are not properly implemented.

For
instance, last week, a family of four elephants was electrocuted by a
low-hanging power line in a coffee plantation in Karnataka’s Kodagu
district.

A probe showed that contrary to a Karnataka HC order,
the power line was less than 9m from the ground. This was not an
isolated case. Data from Delhi-based NGO Wildlife Protection Society of
India (WPSI) show 355 elephants across the country died from deliberate
and accidental electrocution between 2010 and 2016 — 62 of these deaths
took place in 2016 alone. The list identifies flamingos as the second
largest casualty of animal electrocution, at 181, followed by leopards
and peacocks at 64 deaths each over six years.
