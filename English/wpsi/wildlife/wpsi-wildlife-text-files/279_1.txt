GUWAHATI:
More than 90% of the Kaziranga National Park's 430-sq km expanse has
been inundated in what is turning into one of the worst floods the
state has seen.

Animals have been fleeing the park in droves, in
search of higher ground. But the journey is a dangerous one. A 60-km
stretch of National Highway-37 runs along the southern fringe of the
national park - across the road lies the route to the safer highlands
of Karbi Anglong. Large herds of elephants and deer have started moving
to these highlands.

Every year, the park braces for floods.
Every year, the damage is huge. The Nagaon district administration,
following a well-rehearsed protocol, has stopped movement of light
motor vehicles along the stretch. Vehicles have been turned back from
Jakhalabandha in Nagaon and Bokakhat in Golaghat. An additional 100
forest personnel have been deployed along the highway to ensure safe
passage of animals. They are keeping an eye out for poaching attempts
when rhinos stray out of the inundated park.
