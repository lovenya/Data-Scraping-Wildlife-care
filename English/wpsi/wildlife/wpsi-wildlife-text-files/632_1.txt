JABALPUR:
The Union government has ordered a probe into the disappearance of the
lone tiger at the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh. The big cat
has not been sighted for the last 25 days even after two tigresses were
released in the park. 

Sources said a four-member special
investigation team headed by wildlife expert and former director of
Project Tiger P K Sen would investigate the case. The other members of
the team are officials from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun,
Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and National Tiger Conservation
Authority. 

Taking a cue from Sariska Tiger Reserve, the Madhya
Pradesh forest department had shifted two tigresses, one each from
Bandhavgarh National Park and Kanha National Park, to Panna National
Park. Until six years ago, Panna had reportedly 40 tigers. 

Even
while two tigresses were being shifted, reports said â€˜the lone tiger'
had wandered away to forest areas of Chhattarpur. The reports also said
the tiger was spotted in the forests of Chhattarpur. 

Sources
said the Centre ordered the probe after it came to know that the state
forest department was contemplating to shift a male tiger to the Panna
park in an attempt to cover up the fact that `the tiger existed in
Panna only on paper'. 

Field director of Panna Tiger Reserve L
K Chaudhary told TOI on Friday that he was committed to reviving the
lost glory of the park. Asked about the probe, he said he was aware of
it and added he would still try to get a tiger shifted to the park. 3
