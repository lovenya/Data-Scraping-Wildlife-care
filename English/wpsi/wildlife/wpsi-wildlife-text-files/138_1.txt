Arunachal
Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki on Tuesday said the Centre has
decided to exempt environmental clearance for road projects located
within 100 km of international borders.



Speaking in Itanagar, a
day after his meeting with Union Environment minister Prakash Javadekar
in New Delhi, the Chief Minister said the decision would immensely
benefit Arunachal Pradesh as it shares 1,080 km of international
boundary with China. Arunachal Pradesh also shares 440 km border with
Myanmar and 160 km with Bhutan.



Tuki said Javadekar had informed
him of the decision and added that the Union ministry was considering
extending the no-green clearance norm (within 100 km of international
border) to other infrastructure development projects.



Arunachal
Pradesh has been clamouring for funds as well as green clearance for
construction of a road network along the international border, the lack
of which has triggered migration of people away from the border areas.
