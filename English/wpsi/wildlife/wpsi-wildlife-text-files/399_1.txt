Holding TANGEDCO responsible for the death of a male elephant and a few
other animals due to electrocution in Cherambadi forest in The Nilgiris
district in 2020, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the
state power utility to pay a compensation of Rs.75 lakh to the forest
department.

Taking suo motu cognisance based on news reports
published in a vernacular daily on February 27, 2020, the NGT said that
one male elephant, four boars, one common mongoose, one striped-necked
mongoose, three cobras, and one crow had died after coming in contact
with a high-tension electric wire.

Applying the "strict
liability" principle, the NGT said that the high-tension wire was not
insulated and TANGEDCO officials were responsible for the deaths.
