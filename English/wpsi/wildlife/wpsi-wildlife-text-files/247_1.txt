Cyclone Fani: Odisha stares at ecological crisis 

 

10th May 2019

Two of
Odisha’s ecological hotspots – Lake Chilka and Balukhand-Konark
wildlife sanctuary -- may not be the same any more, thanks to Cyclone
Fani that roared through the state on May 3 with wind speeds exceeding
200 km an hour, officials said on Thursday.

Chilka, Asia’s
biggest brackish water lake that earlier had two mouths, now has four
more, stirring fears that salinity could increase by inflow of sea
water and adversely affect marine life, the officials said. Over 4.5
million trees were uprooted by the cyclone in Balakhand, making it look
like a “wasteland”.

Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Puri
last Friday, has left a long trail of destruction along the coast,
uprooting millions of trees, blowing away roofs and homes, and snapping
power. Weather experts have termed Fani the most intense cyclone in the
region in 20 years.

While it affected over 14 million people in
Odisha’s densely populated coastal districts, its impact on ecology and
wildlife has been equally devastating, though an estimate of the damage
has yet to be made. Most part of the ~17,000 crore the state government
has sought from the 
Centre will go into putting people’s lives back on track.
