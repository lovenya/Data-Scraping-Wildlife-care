19th Nov. 2018



The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Ministry of
Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to consider
declaring all elephant corridors in the country as eco-sensitive zones.

Following
a plea that sought legal recognition to the elephant reserves and
corridors in the state of Assam, a bench headed by NGT Chairperson
Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “After hearing the matter for some
time, it was noted by us that issue of elephant corridors have been
raised by different applicants and various judgments have also been
passed by the Tribunal. Therefore, we direct MoEF&CC to look into
this aspect in a broader perspective and also to have a permanent
solution.”

The bench further added, “We would like the Ministry
to look in to the issue by declaring all elephant corridors all over
the country as eco sensitive zones by exercising its power (under
relevant Acts.) We give two weeks time to the Ministry to look into the
issue and to proceed in the matter for declaration of such areas as eco
sensitive zones.”
