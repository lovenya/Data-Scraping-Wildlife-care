Canning
(WB), Sept 1 (PTI) Two tigers were today trapped by forest department
personnel from areas close to Sunderbans in South 24 Parganas district,
official sources said.

While one tiger was caught from
Panchamukhani II forest area, situated opposite to Annpur village
across the Garal river, the other walked into a cage in the Pirkhali II
forest, the sources said.

"We had kept the traps with bait for
the last few days, but were surprised when the goat kept in trap at
Panchamukhani II was lifted by the tiger without being caught", Atanu
Raha, West Bengal's Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW) said adding, "the
animal appears to be very cunning".

The tiger trapped in
Panchamukhani II is believed to have strayed into Annpur village twice
during the last fortnight after swimming across the Garal river, Raha
said.
