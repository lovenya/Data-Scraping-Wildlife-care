Planting
billions of trees across the world is by far the biggest and cheapest
way to tackle the climate crisis, according to scientists, who have
made the first calculation of how many more trees could be planted

As trees grow,
they absorb and store the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving
global heating. New research estimates that a worldwide planting
programme could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been
pumped into the atmosphere by human activities, a figure the scientists
describe as “mind-blowing”.

The analysis found there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land on which 1.2tn native tree saplings would naturally grow.
