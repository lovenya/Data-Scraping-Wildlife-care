Conservationist joins SC panel on elephant corridor case 

 

27 Jan 2021


The
Supreme Court on January 27 appointed conservationist Nandita Hazarika
as Member of a Technical Committee constituted by it on October 14 last
year to hear complaints by land owners against the action taken by the
Nilgris Collector, which included sealing of their buildings and
allegations about the “arbitrary variance in acreage of the elephant
corridor.”

The order came after a Bench led by Chief Justice of
India Sharad A. Bobde was informed of the death of one of the committee
members, Ajay Desai, through an application filed by the Hospitality
Association of Mudumalai.

On October 14, the top court upheld
the Tamil Nadu government’s authority to notify an ‘elephant corridor’
and protect the migratory path of the animals through the Nilgiri
biosphere reserve.
