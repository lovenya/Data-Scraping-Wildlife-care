GUWAHATI:
Three poachers, who would lace venison with highly toxic pesticides to
prevent putrefaction and committed a host of other wildlife crime at
the Nameri National Park and Tiger Reserve, were convicted by a
district court recently.

The Sonitpur additional sessions judge,
S Das, has sentenced Arjun Basumatary, Bijoy Basumatary and Debeswar
Pogag to seven years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs
50,000 on each under the Wildlife (Protection) (Assam Amendment) Act
2009.

Nameri reserve field director and divisional forest
officer of the western Assam wildlife division, Rajendra G Garawad,
said this is probably the first instance in the state when three
poachers have been convicted under the Wildlife (Protection) (Assam
Amendment) Act. Garawad said the verdict came within 14 months of their
arrest, making it one of the fastest conviction cases against poachers.


Among the three, Pogag was one of the most wanted poachers who
had been evading arrest for years by shuttling his base between
Sonitpur and southern states like Karnataka and Kerala. He added that
apart from committing various wildlife crimes, the three were involved
in killing various deer species at Nameri.
