Guwahati,
April 26: Customs sleuths today confiscated an Ahmedabad-bound parcel
containing ivory at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International
Airport here.

“Acting on specific intelligence, officers of the
anti-smuggling unit of Guwahati customs division seized three pieces of
elephant tusk at Guwahati airport this morning,” S.R. Baruah,
commissioner of customs (preventive), Northeast, said.

“The
consignment was booked under Speed Post parcel from Silapathar in
Dhemaji district of Assam and it was destined for Ahmedabad,” he said.

The ivory pieces, weighing 3.450kg, were found concealed under paddy husk inside the Speed Post parcel.

The
parcel was seized when it was about to be loaded into an
Ahmedabad-bound Spicejet flight. The customs officials made the seizure
in the presence of forest and postal officers.

The customs
department has registered a case under relevant provisions of the
Customs Act and the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, but nobody has
been arrested in this connection so far.

“The case is under
investigation and the main culprits are likely to be apprehended very
soon. The value of the tusk is estimated at Rs 10.35 lakh in the
domestic market,” Baruah said.

However, its value is likely to run into crores of rupees in the international market.
