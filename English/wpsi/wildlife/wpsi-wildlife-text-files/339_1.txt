Babesiosis outbreak killing lions in Gir forest

 

6 May 2020




Around 20 lions in Gir (east) wildlife division were killed in the last two months following an outbreak of babesiosis.

“We
have lost some animals because of the disease caused by blood protozoa
called babesia, which, in turn, spreads through tick infestation and
mite bite,” a top officer of Gujarat forest department told The Indian
Express on Wednesday adding that they are trying to contain the
outbreak.

A section of the local media has been reporting for
almost a fortnight that lions are dying under mysterious circumstances
in Gir (east) wildlife division spread across Amreli and Gir Somnath
districts and that more than 20 big cats have died in such a manner
over the past two months. The officer told The Indian Express that most
of the recent deaths of the endangered species from Tulsishyam,
Jasadhar and Hadala ranges of Gir (east) forest division have been
caused by babesiosis.
