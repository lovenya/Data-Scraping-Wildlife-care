Ramesh said he would wait for the Madhya Pradesh to complete its probe
in the disappearance of tigers from Panna reserve. Refusing to blame
individuals for the big cat's disappearance, he said for years the
census figures were exaggerated and incorrect because wrong methodology
was being followed. "It was a system failure. Some pugmarks were
counted over and over again," he said adding that a more scientific
census will be carried out by October 2010. Citing an example, he said
the Sunderbans were believed to have 250 tigers when the actual count
was no more than 10.

Out of 37, only 9 tiger reserves are in
good shape, 12 are in satisfactory condition and 16 in very poor
shape," he said admitting that "there are many Panna and Sariskas
waiting to happen".
