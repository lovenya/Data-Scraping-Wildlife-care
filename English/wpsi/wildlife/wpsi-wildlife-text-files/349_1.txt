No train via Melghat: CM’s final stamp

 

8 Aug 2020



NAGPUR:
The 15th Maharashtra wildlife board meeting, chaired by chief minister
Uddhav Thackeray, on Friday unanimously rejected the upgradation
proposal of railway line through Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in
Amravati district and also ordered the setting up of an expert
committee to consider translocation of 50 tigers from Chandrapur
district. He also rejected the neutering proposal of tigers saying it
should be the last resort.
Also, Kanhargaon in Chandrapur district
is set to be the 62nd protected area in the state. According to sources
who attended the meeting, Thackeray also showed keenness to declare
Mogarkasa, near Ramtek, a conservation reserve. He has sought proposals
to declare more protected areas (sanctuaries, reserves and parks).

The
board members hailed Thackeray for his bold decision to refuse railways
permission for broadening a metre gauge line through MTR. Overwhelmed
by the drone photography of the tiger reserve showing the railway line
and forest, the CM asked officials to submit aerial pictures as
evidence while submitting proposals.
