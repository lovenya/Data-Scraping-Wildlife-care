Leopard Skin Seized near Sundarbans

5th September 2005

                        

The West Bengal Police seized one leopard skin and three chital skins
in Canning on 3 September 2005. Two men, residents of Basanti and
Gosaba, were arrested.

                        

A few days ago, on 31 August 2005, one leopard skin and one chital skin
were seized in the Sundarbans by the West Bengal Forest Department.

                        

The leopard skin seizures are intriguing, since the Sundarbans area
does not have leopards. The origin of the skins will have to be
carefully investigated by the enforcement authorities.4
