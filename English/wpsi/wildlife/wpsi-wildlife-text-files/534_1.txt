9 September 2005

                        

On 2 September 2005, The Royal Nepal Army made a huge seizure of 5
tiger skins, 36 leopard skins, 238 otter skins and 113 kg of
tiger/leopard bones in the Rasuwa district of Nepal, bordering the
Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) of China. The Army and National Park
Authority arrested three people: two are Nepali nationals, while the
third is a Tibetan.

                        

According to preliminary reports received by the Wildlife Protection
Society of India (WPSI), the accused have claimed that the skins and
bones belong to a trader from the Bouddha area of Kathmandu. They were
carrying the illegal animal articles from Kathmandu, via Bidur, Dhunche
and Syabru, to the TAR when they were arrested. The case has now been
handed over to the Langtang National Park authorities.

                        

This is the third major seizure in Nepal this year. On 10 August 2005,
1 tiger skin, 1 leopard skin and 103 pieces of tiger/leopard bones were
seized in Kathmandu. Four people of the Bawaria community of Haryana,
India, were arrested. In April 2005, 2 tiger skins were seized in
Tatopani, while they were being carried to the TAR.
