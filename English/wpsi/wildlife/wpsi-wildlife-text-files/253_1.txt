Centre asks road-making authorities to avoid construction in protected areas

 

13 June 2019

The Centre
has asked all authorities responsible for road construction to avoid
building highways in protected areas, such as national parks and
wildlife sanctuaries.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and
Highways asked National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), National
Highways and Infrastructure Development Corp Ltd (NHIDCL) and Border
Roads Organisation (BRO) to avoid making highways through such
protected areas unless the projects are unavoidable, PTI reported.

“If
it is absolutely unavoidable, all necessary clearances required under
the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, Forest Conservation Act 1980 and
Environment (Protection) Act 1986 should be obtained before any work is
undertaken in such areas,” the news agency reported citing a circular
from the ministry.

India's protected areas have increasingly
come under pressure from an ever-increasing infrastructure network —161
wild animals were killed in road or train accidents in 2018, DTE
reported in its State of India's Environment 2019 (SoE) in Figures.
