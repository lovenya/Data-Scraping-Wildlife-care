ALIPURDUAR:
Risking their lives, workers of a tea garden in Alipurduar in the
Dooars rescued an elephant calf on Friday night while it was struggling
to cross a rivulet off the estate.

Workers of Tulsipara Tea
Estate said they heard an elephant scream around 11pm. Around dawn,
they came out and saw the calf lying in a rivulet flowing by the
garden. Its mother was standing on the banks and screaming. When some
workers tried descending towards the water body to rescue the calf, the
mother charged at them.

To save the calf, the workers brought a
pay-loader vehicle stationed nearby to the banks of the rivulet. After
they shouted in unison, the mother moved a few metres away. The
pay-loader driver then used the vehicle to demolish part of the
embankment of the water body. Workers stretched their hands to help the
calf out. As the embankment wall was broken and water gushed out, it
managed to rise and walked to the banks. Locals then helped it move
towards the mother. There were injury marks on its body.
