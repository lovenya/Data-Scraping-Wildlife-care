Snow Leopard Seizure 
                        
                        29th August, 2003
                        According to preliminary 
                          reports, a Special Operations Group team of the Pithoragarh 
                          Police seized one leopard skin and one snow leopard 
                          skin from a poacher. Acting on intelligence gathered, 
                          constables Azab Singh and Pervez Alam, lead by Mr. Sudhir 
                          Kumar, arrested the poacher on 28 August at Rai bridge 
                          on the Pithoragarh-Dharchula road. 
                        Investigations suggest that the poacher 
                          killed the animals in Sikher forests of Uttaranchal 
                          three months ago. The skins were cleaned locally and 
                          were to be delivered to a Delhi-based trader.
                        In the last year there has been clear 
                          evidence suggesting an increased demand for snow leopard 
                          skins. A study by TRAFFIC International shows that the 
                          species and its parts are illegally traded in all twelve 
                          range countries, though the driving forces behind the 
                          killings vary from region to region. 
                        In Afghanistan the fur trade has gone 
                          up by an estimated 60% and the interest shown by the 
                          international troops stationed in the country could 
                          well ensure the extinction of the snow leopard there. 
                          Moreover, the crackdown on the illegal tiger bone trade 
                          has led to an increased demand for snow leopard bones 
                          by Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners.
