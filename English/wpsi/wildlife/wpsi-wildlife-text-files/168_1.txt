With
as many as 393 elephants having been killed in Orissa in the last five
years, the state seems seems to have become a graveyard for the animals.

According to sources in the state government, most of the elephants died because of poaching, electrocution, t

In
a written reply to BJD member Amar Prasad Satpathy in the Orissa
Assembly, state forest and environment minister Bikram Keshari Arukh
admitted on Tuesday that the elephant population in the state was
disturbed because of forest fire, increase in urbanisation, expansion
of industrial activities and mining operations, population growth and
encroachment of forest lands.

According to wildlife expert
Biswajit Mohanty, elephants are dying in large numbers because the
state government is not acting in right earnest to protect them.
