International trade of Indian star tortoise and otters is now banned

 

27 August 2019


In a
boost to India’s bid to protect endangered animal species, the United
Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
in Geneva on Monday banned illegal international trade of Indian star
tortoise, smooth-coated otters and Asian small-clawed otters.

These
proposals had been put forth by India in December 2018 for
consideration at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties
(CoP18) to the convention. The plan received a majority acceptance from
world leaders.

Apart from the ban on commercial trade for some
species, Tokay gecko and 18 shark species were upgraded to a higher
protection level.

“It has been a remarkable success for us with
almost all of our proposals receiving consensus from member states,”
said MS Negi, additional director general of forest (wildlife),
Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), who was
present at the conference.
