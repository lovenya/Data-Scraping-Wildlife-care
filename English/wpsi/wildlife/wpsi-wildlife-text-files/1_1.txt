Rash of Leopard Deaths Across India


15 January 2007

                        

Police in the Indo-Bhutan border town of Jaigaon, West Bengal, arrested
three people on 10 January 2007 and recovered the skins of three
leopards and two fishing cats. Two of the accused are residents of
Assam, and the third is a resident of Nepal. Interrogations have
revealed that they bought the skins from traders from Bhutan. The
accused were produced in Alipurduar court on 11 January, where their
bail was rejected. A WPSI representative in north Bengal is following
the case closely.

                        

There were two significant seizures in the northern border areas of
West Bengal last year. On 14 July, notorious trader Ratiram Sharma was
arrested with 4 leopard skins, 11kg tiger bones and skulls and 16 kg
rhino skins. A few days later, on 25 July, his son Ashok Sharma was
arrested with 1 tiger skin and 3 leopard skins.
