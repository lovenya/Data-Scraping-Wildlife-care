Uttarakhand high court: No resorts in jumbo corridor near Corbett

 

2 Sept 2022NAINITAL:
The Uttarakhand high court has directed the state government to provide
an "eco-sensitive zone" status to the elephant corridor adjoining
Corbett Tiger Reserve and disallow "construction of any hotels,
resorts, or restaurants there". The court sought adequate arrangements
for night guards so that "jumbos can move freely in the dark"
.
The
central and state governments have also been asked to take necessary
steps for conservation of traditional elephant corridors, and to look
into issues of excessive traffic at night. The HC said construction of
roads near the corridor without a proper underpass should be avoided.
