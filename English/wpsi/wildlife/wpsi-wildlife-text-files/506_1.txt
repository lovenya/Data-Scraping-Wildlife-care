Driver 
                        fined for Sambhar Death 
                        
                        9th Dec., 2004
                         In what is believed 
                          to be the first instance of a person being penalised 
                          for killing a wild animal due to negligence, a man was 
                          fined Rs. 60,000 for hitting and killing a deer in a 
                          road accident on 4 December 2004, on the Dehradun-Haridwar 
                          highway.
                        The Bolero vehicle overturned in the accident that 
                          occurred near the Lachchiwala Forest Picnic Spot. Mr. 
                          Paramjit Singh, Director of the Anti-Poaching Cell of 
                          the Uttaranchal Forest Dept. and Mr. R.S. Kenda, Wildlife 
                          Warden, Dehradun, rushed to the scene and arrested the 
                          driver.
                        The case was compounded with the hefty fine and the 
                          vehicle returned to the owner.
                        “We hope this case will deter drivers from speeding 
                          through forest areas” said Belinda Wright, Executive 
                          Director of Wildlife Protection Society of India.
