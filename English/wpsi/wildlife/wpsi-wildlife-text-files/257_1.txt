Dhenkanal:
Acting on a tip-off, forest officials Monday arrested a poacher in
connection with the death of a 25-year-old tusker at a jungle near
Karnapur beat house under Hindol forest range in this district June 12.

The accused has been identified as Biswanath Samal, 58. The forest officials also seized some wires from his possession.

Samal confessed to the crime during interrogation before assistant conservator of forest Jitendranath Das said.

The
matter came to the fore after forest officials recovered the carcass
Wednesday. Preliminary probe indicated that the animal might have died
of electrocution. Forest officials started an investigation as they
conducted a post-mortem of the carcass and buried it at the spot.

When
contacted, divisional forest officer Sudarshan Patra said the tusker
was moving in the area with no report of illness but its sudden death
has raised doubts. He said that the actual reason behind the animal’s
death was ascertained after completion of the investigation and receipt
of the post-mortem report.
