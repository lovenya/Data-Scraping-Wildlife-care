can see the highest-ever human casualties due to human-elephant
conflict (HEC) in 2021-2022 than the years before, experts have warned.

Some
97 people have been killed in HEC from March 2021 to January 18, 2022.
There have been 96 injuries. There are still two months to go before
2021-2022 gets over.

“HEC has been raging during the last six
weeks across all elephant-range districts of the state, with more
elephants entering villages in search of food,” Biswajit Mohanty, the
secretary of Wildlife Society of Odisha, a non-profit, said.

“We
could probably see more human casualties than 2020-21, which recorded
106 human deaths and 119 injuries. Incidentally, the highest number of
human deaths was in 2019-20 in which 115 people were killed and 132
were injured,” Mohanty added.
