A historic judgement by the Supreme Court on elephant corridors

 

10th Sep., 2018



Last month, the Supreme Court (SC) did something extraordinary.
On August 9, in response to a Public Interest Litigation, it directed
the Tamil Nadu government to seal or close down 39 hotels and resorts
constructed on an “elephant corridor” in the Nilgiri Hills in violation
of law, within the next 48 hours.

Justice Lokur, along with
Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Deepak Gupta also said elephants were the
country’s “national heritage” and expressed displeasure about the
encroachments.    

It was a historic judgement by
the SC on India’s elephants. While they play a key role as a “Keystone
Species” in the forest ecosystem and are termed as the “National
Heritage Animal of India” by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest
and Climate Change, the plight of the Indian Elephant is known to all.
As more forest areas face fragmentation due to unscrupulous
encroachment and other developmental activities, the pachyderms are
forced to migrate and find themselves in human-dominated landscapes,
leading to human-elephant conflict. Cattle grazing, coffee and tea
plantations, private tourist resorts, electric fences, expansion of
agricultural fields, vehicular traffic especially during night hours
and human settlements along elephant corridors pose a greater threat
for the free movement of elephant herds that are in the habit of
migrating across 350-500 sq km annually.
