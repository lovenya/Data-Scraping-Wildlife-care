6,000 trees, not 163, felled in Corbett for tiger safari: FSI

 

2 Oct 2022DEHRADUN:
Nearly a year after a TOI report said that thousands of trees, and not
just "163" for which the Uttarakhand administration had sought
permission for, were cut without permission in the Corbett Tiger
Reserve, the Forest Survey of India has now confirmed that "over 6,000
trees" were felled in the 40-acre dense forest to facilitate the Pakhro
Tiger Safari.

The FSI, a premier body for survey of forest
wealth in the country under the Union ministry of environment, forest
and climate change, had conducted a ground survey of CTR in June 2022,
after which its findings confirmed that "thousands of trees were infeed
felled, not a few hundred". TOI had reported that on September 2021.
