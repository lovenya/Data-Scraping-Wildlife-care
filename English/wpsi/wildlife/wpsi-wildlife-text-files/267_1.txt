‘Review elephant safety every month’

 

29 June 2019




Wildlife
expert and Wildlife Society of Orissa secretary Biswajit Mohanty has
written a letter to CM Naveen Patnaik expressing deep concern over
the  high death toll of elephants in the State, underscoring a
need for a review on monthly basis of the safety measures taken for the
elephants.

In view of a recent killing of an adult female
elephant near Kuanriapal in the Sadar Forest range of Dhenkanal Forest
Division, which was knocked down by a train, Mohanty told that 
figures of elephant causality in Odisha for various reasons like
poaching, train kill, electrocution and other  unnatural causes
are alarming as the State reports the highest number of elephant deaths
in the country.

Mohanty told, “We have been regularly flagging
the threats to elephants and suggesting remedial measures to the PCCF
and Chief Wildlife Warden, Odisha but elephants continue to be
ruthlessly slaughtered.”

He lamented that the issue has been brought to the notice of the Forest and Environment Minister several times but in vain.
