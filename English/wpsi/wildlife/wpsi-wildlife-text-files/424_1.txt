India's high demand for exotic pets leads to rise in animal smuggling

 

31 Oct 2022Six
live animals have been seized from the checked-in luggage of a
passenger in Chennai, in a case that highlights a growing trend for
smuggling rare species into India and loopholes in its wildlife laws.

Airport
officials found five dwarf mongooses and a common spotted cuscus, a
marsupial that lives in Australia and New Guinea, last week. They were
concealed in the bags of a traveller from Thailand.

The animals
were returned to their native countries and the passenger was arrested,
but the incident yet again exposed the rise in cases of smuggling of
wildlife into the country.
