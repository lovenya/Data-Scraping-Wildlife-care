BANDIPUR: A major fire that gutted thousands of acres of land in the Bandipur tiger reserve has been doused.

Karnataka's top forest official confirmed that an "act of sabotage" had caused the blaze. 

"We
have definite clues about those responsible for setting off the fire,"
principal chief conservator of forests Punati Sridhar said. "Our probe
is continuing. The forest department recently took strict action
certain offenders and we suspect they were trying to retaliate."
Teams
of firemen and foresters fought a desperate battle against the
conflagration - one the most devastating forest fires in the state. The
fire devoured swathes of terrain in Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta (GS
Betta) near here after ravaging parts of Kundakere and Maddur ranges a
day earlier. 

By late evening on Sunday, forest officials
estimated that the fire had devoured at least 60% of the 70-sqkm GB
Range, and affected many other stretches of the forest areas in the
region. Forest officers are working on all options - including using
fresh shrubs and sand - to douse the blaze.
