4th April 2019

Five
leopard cubs were charred to death in a sugarcane farm in Ambegaon
taluka of Pune district on Wednesday morning. According to forest
officials, the cubs were killed after a farmer burnt trash suspecting
there was a snake in it.

The cubs were around 10 days old.
Forest officials said the farmer suspected there was a snake in the
trash and decided to burn it. Farmers usually burn waste before the
harvesting of sugarcane.

Forest officials believe that the mother of the cubs may have left them in the field when she went to search of food.

Prajot
Palve, range forest officer of Ambegaon, said people have been deployed
for night patrolling as the mother leopard may turn violent in her
search of them.

The farm workers are afraid of going back to work fearing an attack from the mother leopard, said forest officials.
