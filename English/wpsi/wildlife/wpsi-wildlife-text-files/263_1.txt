GUWAHATI:
The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) has emphatically said that it will
not dispatch the four elephants to Ahmedabad from Assam’s Tinsukia for
the Jagannath Rath Yatra on July 4 till it receives a “clarification”
on an order of the Supreme Court from the forest department of Assam
and the matter is resolved by the Gauhati High Court.

“We have
sought a clarification from the forest department of Assam on an order
of the Supreme Court. Till that clarification is received, we will not
dispatch the elephants by the railway,” Masood Alom, who is the
Additional Divisional Railway Manager of Tinsukia Division, told The
New Indian Express on Saturday.

“Our zonal headquarters
(Maligaon) has written the letter to the forest department seeking the
clarification. Also, there is a Public Interest Litigation filed in the
Gauhati High Court. Till the case is resolved, we will not dispatch the
elephants,” he further said.
