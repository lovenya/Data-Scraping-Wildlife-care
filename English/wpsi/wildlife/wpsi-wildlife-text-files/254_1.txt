NEW
DELHI: The process of granting environmental clearances has become
faster as the government has reduced the number of days taken to
complete the procedure from 640 to 108, Union environment minister
Prakash Javadekar said Friday. Speaking at the national council meeting
of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) here, he also promised
to further bring down the time taken to grant clearances to a period of
two to three months.

"Earlier, the environment ministry was
addressed as roadblock ministry or tax ministry. There was an
atmosphere that there will be no progress of the country. But we showed
that environment protection and growth can go together," Javadekar said
while addressing over 100 industrialists at the meeting.

"On an
average, it used to take 640 days in granting environment clearances.
When I was environment minister for two years, I brought it down to 180
days and now, when I took review, it has come down to 108 days. I
promise you that in the coming days we will do our best to bring it
down to three or two months," the minister said.
