NAGPUR:
In a strong message to those taking poaching of wild animals lightly,
Justice SB Shukre at the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court has rejected
the bail application of accused involved in consuming meat of monitor
lizard in Amravati.

Manoj Vasantrao Jagtap and several others
were involved in killing four monitor lizards for a party at Jagtap's
farmhouse on July 17.

Based on statements of co-accused, the
panchnama drawn out by forest officers and seizures made by them court
prima facie supported what was revealed by co-accused Maroti Waghmare
and Vilas Dahake. The DNA report is positive stating that large Bengal
Monitor Lizard (Varanus Bengalensis), listed in Part II of Schedule of
the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, was consumed.

Justice Shukre
said that the seriousness of the crime in the case can be further
realized if we consider its impact on the larger interest of the
society. "Today, human society is desperate to get adequate supply of
water, leave alone unpolluted water, and pure air. Good forest
ecosystems are treasure troves of these fundamental resources. If they
are disturbed or twisted or tweaked, human society will be hard put to
get these fundamental resources and that will push the human society to
the brink of a crisis," Justice Shukre said.
