Elephant poaching in Odisha at all-time high after 13 cases of unnatural deaths emerge

 

7 Aug 2022On
July 29, a 25-year-old tusker in Narasinghpur East range of Athagarh
forest division of Cuttack district with at least five pellet injuries
on its ear and head died of organ failure. The veterinary doctors who
treated the tusker unsuccessfully suspected that one of the pellets may
have pierced deep into its head. The wounded elephant, likely to be a
victim of a gang of local poachers in Athagarh division, was first
sighted by local people on July 23 who tipped off wildlife activists
and later the chief wildlife warden.

It was tranquilised on July 25, but it was too late as the wounds caused by the pellets had triggered septicemia.

The
death of the tusker was a re-run of a similar poaching of a tusker in
June first week when another tusker with at least 5 pellet injuries on
its trunk, face, legs and body was found writhing in pain in the same
forest range by local people.
