India’s greenest
region, the north-east has been consistently losing tree cover over the
last 18 years. The loss has been doubled in the last five years,
according to the data mapped by Global Forest Watch, a repository of
forest data worldwide.

The statewise data available with DH
shows that the loss of tree cover in north-east India amounts to over
70% of all tree loss in India that occurred between 2001 and 2018. Net
loss of tree cover between 2000 and 2018 in India is 16,744 sq km. Out
of this, 12,523 sqkm, a whopping 74.7%, is from the north-eastern
states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and others.  

Data
shows that 6,867.57 sqkm of tree cover got eroded in the period between
2013 and 2018, the period coinciding with NDA rule at the Centre. This
is a little less than half of the loss occurred between the period of
2001-2018.
