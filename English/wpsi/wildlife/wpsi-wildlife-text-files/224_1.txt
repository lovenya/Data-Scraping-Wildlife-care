ecosystem conservationist Anil Mistry could have tread the path his
predecessors and peers had taken. A path that led to chopping off
forests and killing animals for fast cash, as floods ravaged his island

“Since
my childhood, I was aware that this area was associated with poaching
and illegal cutting of trees. There was no progress [development] in
the village. Floods ravaged our village. Automatically we took to
poaching. Usually, we went for the deer and if we spotted a tiger then
we got it too,” Mistry told Mongabay-India in a candid chat in Bali
island village in the Sundarbans.

“Once on a hunt, my friend
killed a doe and her fawn was around her. The doe was wounded and was
crying (in pain). It died. This encounter left me distraught with
grief,” the 52-year-old Mistry recalled the incident from two decades
