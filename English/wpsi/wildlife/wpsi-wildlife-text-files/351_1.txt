NAGPUR:
In a major move, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change
(MoEFCC) has reorganized its regional and sub-regional offices in the
country from 29 to 19. Now, all the offices will be under one roof and
called as integrated regional offices (IROs) to be headed by deputy
director general of forest (Dy DGF) called as regional officer.
The IROs will start functioning from October 1.

TOI
on May 12 was first to report this. Now, the IROs will include offices
of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Central Zoo Authority
(CZA), Forest Survey of India (FSI) and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau
(WCCB). In Nagpur, NTCA regional office will also be merged with MoEFCC
office.Though the decision has
been taken in a bid to provide synergy and strength, and make regional
offices more effective, there is still ambiguity about the notification
as to whom the CZA, FSI, WCCB and NTCA officials report.
