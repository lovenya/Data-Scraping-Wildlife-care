                        NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 20: Taking note of The Sunday
Express report on the killing on tigers inside Ranthambhore National
Park, the Rajasthan government today transferred the two top forest
officials of the Park. 

                        


Conservator of Forest Shafat Hussein and deputy field director G S
Bhardwaj have been asked to relinquish charge with immediate effect.
"Both officials have been put on APO (Awaiting Posting Order). The
CM is keen to fix accountability and has signed the order on a
Sunday," Rajasthan Chief Wildlife Warden R N Mehrotra told The
Indian Express. While R S Shekawat will immediately take charge as
DFO, the new Conservator may be named tomorrow. 

                        


Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has also convened a high-level meeting
tomorrow to discuss the crisis. The Sunday Express reported how
three poachers had confessed to killing 10 Ranthambhore tigers since 2003
and named another seven who had taken out at least a dozen more.
                        

                        


"We will work in close coordination with the police department and,
like we have done in Sariska, hope to bust the entire racket here very
soon," Mehrotra said. Meanwhile, a joint team of CID crime branch,
Kota (Rural) police and Sawai Madhopur police raided villages around the
Park in search of suspects named by poachers in custody.
