Notorious rhino horn trader Gyalbo Gurung was arrested in Kathmandu on
27 August 2006, in a joint operation by the Nepal Police and the
Department of National Parks, assisted by Wildlife Conservation Nepal
(WCN).

                        

Eight months of investigation and observation by WCN culminated in a
dramatic raid during which Gurung nearly escaped by jumping out of a
first floor window. He then tried to bribe his way to freedom allegedly
offering the enforcement personnel US$8,000 in cash - but was thwarted.

                        

Gurung is linked with over 25 rhino deaths in Chitwan National Park
over the past two years. He is believed to have offered huge sums of
money equal to two yearsâ€™ earnings to encourage locals to hunt
rhinos and deliver horns to him. In the last 30 days alone, he is
believed to have financed 6 rhino deaths.

                        

Gurung has now been moved to Chitawan for interrogation and safe custody.
