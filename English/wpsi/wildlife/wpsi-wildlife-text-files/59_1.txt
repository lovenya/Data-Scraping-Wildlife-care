Environment
minister Jairam Ramesh is not new to controversy. At present he is
being targeted by the political opposition and some green activists for
relaxing India’s stand on climate change at the just concluded
negotiations in Cancun, Mexico. Ramesh believes his actions have been
misunderstood and that his stance, sometimes controversial, on domestic
development projects is based on existing green laws. In an interview
with Mint, Ramesh maintained that his tenure has marked a shift in the
way the environment ministry views the development versus environment
debate. Going forward, he is convinced that his actions will not be
reversed. Edited excerpts:

Critics say that you sold out at Cancun. True?

That
is a complete misreading of the situation. I think what we accomplished
at Cancun has been recognized internationally. Whether in developed or
developing countries, India’s role in fashioning a solution at Cancun
and restoring the primacy of the multilateral process has been
acknowledged. It is a bit unfortunate that there have been certain
sections in India which have sort of cried foul and said sovereignty
has been bartered away, for the umpteenth time.

What is your justification of the change in stance?

I
have sent a detailed six-page letter to all members of Parliament where
I have explained what all our contributions at Cancun were.
