More than 300 beetles and butterflies were seized by the Kerala Forest
Department in the Nilambur area of Malappuram district on 29 October
2006. The Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) provided
information and assistance.

                        

Dr. N.C. Induchudan, the DFO of Nilambur, headed an operation that
culminated in the arrest of four traders from Gudalloor, Tamil Nadu,
and the seizure of 55 live beetles, 258 dead beetles and 28
butterflies, including Schedule I species like the Malabar Banded
Swallowtail. All the other insects were endemic to the area.

                        

According to WPSI field information, the insects are collected by local
people and sold to traders who, in turn, sell them to foreign tourists
and collectors. The four arrested men are believed to have supplied to
Japanese collectors in the past.
