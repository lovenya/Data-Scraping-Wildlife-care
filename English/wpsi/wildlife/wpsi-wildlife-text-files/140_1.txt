Supreme Court issues notice to Salman Khan in black buck hunting case

The
Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a notice to Bollywood actor Salman
Khan in response to the Rajasthan government's plea challenging a high
court decision that had stayed his conviction in a black buck hunting
case.

A bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya asked Khan,
who was sentenced to a five-year jail term by a trial court in the
case, to file his response within four weeks. 

The state
government approached the apex court to challenge the ruling of the
Rajasthan High Court, which had on November 12 last year stayed Khan's
2006 conviction and enabled him to apply for a British visa.

The
passports of Indian convicts are stamped with the word "convict". Under
British immigration rules, any person convicted for more than four
years is not eligible for a visa.

Since the actor was convicted for five years, he was denied a visa by the British Embassy.

The
black buck is a protected animal and hunting it is a punishable
offence. Khan was convicted and given separate one-year and five-year
prison terms in cases related to the poaching of two Chinkaras at
Bhawad and a black buck at Ghoda Farm on the intervening night of
September 26-27, 1998 and September 28-29, 1998 respectively.
