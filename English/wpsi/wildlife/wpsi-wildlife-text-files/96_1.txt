The
environment clearance granted to Posco's mega steel project in Orissa
in January 2011 will remain suspended till the environment ministry
reviews it afresh, the National Green Tribunal held today.

"The
environment clearance granted on January 31, 2011 to the project shall
remain suspended till such review and appraisal is done by the
ministry," a bench of tribunal comprising Justice C.V. Ramulu and
Devendra Kumar Agarwal held.

The tribunal pointed out that
memorandum of understanding between the Orissa government and Posco
states that the project is for production of 12 million tonnes of steel
per annum (MTPA) but the environment impact assessment (EIA) report has
been prepared only for 4 MTPA steel production in the first phase.

It
said the MoEF should take 'policy decision' that in projects of such
magnitude the EIA should be done for the complete project.
