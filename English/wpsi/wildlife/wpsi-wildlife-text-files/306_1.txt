Dehradun:
Scientists working at the forensic laboratory of Wildlife Institute of
India (WII) have found that majority of wildlife killings in India in
past 32 years took place just “to fulfil people's gastronomic desires”.
Ever since 1987, WII received around 3,700 samples. Tissue culture and
DNA analysis show that 65% of wild animals were killed for food and the
remaining 35% was for illegal trading, said senior WII scientist Dr SK
Gupta.

Most forensic cases have surfaced from Madhya Pradesh
(1,029) followed by Uttarakhand (675), Uttar Pradesh (343) and Haryana
(252), Maharashtra (210) and Chhattisgarh (190).

Besides, of all
the samples received for analysis at India’s premiere wildlife forensic
laboratory, majority of samples belonged to wild boars, spotted deer,
sambar and nilgai.
