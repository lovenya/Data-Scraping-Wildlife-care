Why are Kangaroos turning up in India?

Â 

22 Apr 2022On
the edges of forests in eastern India, people have been stumbling upon
hungry, scared marsupials that they do not recognize. The animals are
kangaroos.

Three of the marsupials were rescued by wildlife
officers this month after residents called in sightings. One was found
dead. Videos of the sightings were shared widely in India, drawing
national attention.

Wildlife experts say the animals were almost
certainly born in breeding facilities in Southeast Asia and smuggled
overland into India, where they were probably destined to be exotic
pets. Some social media users have demanded the arrest of whoever had
trafficked them. But so far no arrests have been made.
