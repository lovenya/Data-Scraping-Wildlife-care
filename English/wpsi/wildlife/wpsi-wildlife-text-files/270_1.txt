In Kaziranga, now a special force to protect the one-horned rhino 

 

3 July 2019




On
July 1, 82 constables of the first-ever batch of a “Special Rhino
Protection Force” (SRPF) were deployed in various parts of UNESCO World
Heritage Site Kaziranga National Park in Assam. This special force has
one sole objective: to protect the one-horned rhino. The force, which
consists of 74 men and eight women, underwent 43 weeks of training and
on June 28 participated in a passing-out parade at the 9th Assam Police
Batallion (APBN), Berhampur, Nagaon. On July 1, the constables assumed
their duties across the national park.

What is the main duty of the SRPF?

“Their
main responsibility is to protect the rhino,” says P Sivakumar,
director, Kaziranga National Park, “They cannot be engaged in any other
duty unless it involves protecting the rhino.” Designed on the lines of
the Assam Forest Protection Force (AFPF) (formed in 1986 for the
“better protection and security of the forests, forest produce and
wildlife of Assam”), the squad, raised in collaboration between the
central and state governments, is an initiative of National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA).
