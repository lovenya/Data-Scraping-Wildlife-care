MoEF to 
                        Tackle Encroachments in Additions to Kaziranga 
                        
                        21st Dec., 2004
                         On 17 December 2004, 
                          hearing a petition filed by the Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI) in 2003, the Central Empowered 
                          Committee asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests 
                          (MoEF) to look into encroachments in the six Additions 
                          to Kaziranga National Park. 
                        The Committee reminded Mr. A.D.N. Rao, counsel for 
                          the MoEF, that Kaziranga would celebrate its centenary 
                          in February 2005, and the issue of conflicting land 
                          rights would have to be resolved. 
                        Kaziranga, a World Heritage Site, has lost large tracts 
                          of land due to erosion by the Brahmaputra River. The 
                          government had notified six Additions to the National 
                          Park, which would increase habitat area for the animals, 
                          as well as serve as corridors to higher land during 
                          the annual floods. Unfortunately, the future of the 
                          Additions is uncertain due to continuous litigation 
                          in the Guwahati High Court by cattle grazers and settlers. 
                        
                        Mr. Rao stated that he had received permission from 
                          the MoEF to proceed with the filing of Special Leave 
                          Petitions to settle the issue. These will be filed in 
                          the first week of January 2005.
