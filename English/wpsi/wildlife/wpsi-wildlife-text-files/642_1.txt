22 May 2009
 

NAGPUR:
Acting Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) S K Sood has
been asked by the Government to submit a report on the disappearance of
tigers from forests around the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. The Indian
Express had first reported on May 16 how man-animal conflict, which had
claimed 11 lives in 2006, 14 in 2007 and 26 in 2008, had almost come to
an end with only one death being reported in the affected area in the
past five months. Over the past 10 months, death of four tiger cubs,
orphaning of five others and cases of missing tigresses have been
reported from three different spots. The department has now sought
“immediate” explanation from Sood on the reports of disappearance of
tigers being the reason for the end of the man-animal conflict. ENS
