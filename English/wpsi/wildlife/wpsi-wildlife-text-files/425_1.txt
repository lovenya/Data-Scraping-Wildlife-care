Thanks to Namibia for cheetahs? India abstains on ivory trade vote

 

20 Nov 2022For
the first time since joining the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) in 1976, India did not
vote against a proposal seeking to re-open the ivory trade.

That
proposal, to allow a regular form of controlled trade in ivory from
Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, was defeated 83-15 at the
19th meeting of the CITES Conference of the Parties (CoP19) in Panama
City Friday evening.

India’s abstention — a break from its past
stand — was in tune with what Namibia had asked for when it agreed to
transfer cheetahs this summer.
