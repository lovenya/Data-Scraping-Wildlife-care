Shahtoosh Seizure in 
                        Dharchula 
                        
                        18th August, 2004
                        Dharchula, notorious 
                          smuggling trade point for wildlife products and narcotics 
                          is in the news again. On 16 August 2004, approximately 
                          16 kg of raw shahtoosh wool were seized by the police 
                          in this remote Uttaranchal town near the Indo-Nepal 
                          border.
                        According to information received by the Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI), a police party of five constables, 
                          led by Sub-Inspector Udaiveer Singh stopped a refrigerated 
                          van for a routine check as it was heading out for Delhi. 
                          The driver was arrested when shahtoosh wool was found 
                          in the van. 
                        It is believed that the shahtoosh was hidden among 
                          66 kg of pashmina, which were kept in the container 
                          of the refrigerated vehicle. The van was used to carry 
                          food for the employees of a multi-national construction 
                          company working on the Dhauliganga Hydro-electric Project. 
                        
                        During interrogation, the driver revealed that the 
                          seized shahtoosh belonged to a local trader, who is 
                          now absconding. Interestingly, it appears that this 
                          trader is the nephew of a senior Forest officer from 
                          Delhi.
