67 elephants died in Odisha in last nine months

 

21st December 2018



Odisha has become a graveyard state for elephants as 67 of them
have died there in the last nine months, shows data released by
Wildlife Society of Odisha (WSO), an environmental pressure group, on
December 20, 2018.

This elephant mortality data shows that 18
jumbos died due to natural causes, 19 of unknown reasons, four were
killed by poachers, nine were electrocuted by live wire, 11 by sagging
lines and six elephants were mowed down by trains. These deaths were
reported between April 1, 2018 and December 18, 2018.

This goes
to show that 45 per cent of dead elephants were led to that fate by
unnatural causes. Moreover, no reason has been ascertained for around
28 per cent deaths, some of which could also be due to unnatural
causes. “It would not be unfair to conclude that more than 50 per cent
of elephant deaths occurred due to unnatural causes,” says Biswajit
Mohanty, secretary, WSO.

Another matter of concern is that adult
breeding male elephants form a majority among those who died of
unnatural causes. “Odisha loses 18-20 such adult male elephants every
year threatening the health and sustainability of its elephant
population.
