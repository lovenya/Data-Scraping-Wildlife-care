RAIPUR:
Illegal trade of bush meat, also known as wild meat has come to light
in Chhattisgarh with shocking images of hundreds of slaughtered monkeys
at Devvadvi region near Ambagarh Chowki in Rajnandgaon district located
about 80km from state capital.

While
forest department is yet to trace offenders, state wildlife activists
accused them of gross negligence and corruption. They alleged that
forest department was assisting poachers in cross-border exporting of
wild meat, skin and brain.

Nearly 2km from forest check-post on
the banks of Shivnath river, locals noticed groups of people who had
taken refuge in forest of Devvadvi for last few days and killed at
least 40 monkeys everyday.

Talking to TOI, Anish Goswami, a
resident said, "The groups belonged to Bandesar region in Bastar and
were seen for last few days. When I visited with team of other locals,
there was a huge carpet-like view of monkeys' body pieces drying under
sun. They had killed monkeys in thousands, cut them into pieces, dried
and packed the meat after boiling and processing."

Nearby
villagers also complained of meat being transported in a van on
Wednesday after which, a complaint was made to forest officials,
Goswami said adding that due to abundance of monkeys in this region,
poachers have been visiting the place for the last five years in
summers.

Narrating the conversation he had with the offenders,
he said, "They store it for their own consumption and also sell it to
locals of Pankhajur area. But as soon as locals informed forest
officials, the group disappeared the next day. Fearing serious
allegations, officials chased them away."
