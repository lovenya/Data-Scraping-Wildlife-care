A
gang involved in illegal trade of the organs of pangolin and other
wildlife through online platform YouTube has been exposed by taking
action under the Operation Wildnet.

The Special Task Strike
Force (Wildlife) and Tiger Strike Force Indore and Sagar took action in
Ujjain and Shivpuri, arresting 3 accused with 2.7 k.g. of pangolin
scales. The case was registered after confiscating scales of pangolin
and 2 pieces of ornaments made of elephant tusk.

Deputy
Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) said that this was the first case
registered in the state, in which gangs were smuggling wildlife organs
in the state and outside the state, using the social media platform
YouTube.

The Forest Cyber Cell constituted under the Special
Task Force (Wildlife), while investigating the case, found that illegal
trade was being carried out by the gang by making and uploading videos
related to wildlife, in which people got involved in this criminal act
because of greed/ superstition and the number of such persons also
continued to increase.
