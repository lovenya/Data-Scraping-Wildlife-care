An
international racket of trade in tiger parts has been unearthed by the
Wildlife Crime Control Bureau leading to the arrest of three alleged
poachers.

The racket, having connections with Narayan, brother
of jailed poacher Sansarchand, was busted during a five-month long
operation in four north Indian states.

Three key members --
Dariya, Pema Gytso, Omprakash -- were arrested from different states
during last five months. The latest arrest was of Omprakash on Monday
in Haldwani, Uttarakhand.

During separate interrogation sessions, WCCB officials came to know about the involvement of Narayan.

"Although
some members including Bheema and Narayan are still absconding but
information revealed by the accused has given us complete movement
details of poachers and traders of tiger parts," WCCB Deputy Director R
K Pandey told reporters.

The first arrest was made on April 29
in Bijrani range of Corbett Tiger Reserve. The accused Dariya was
caught in the protected area while he was trying to set a trap.

Later,
Uttar Pradesh police arrested a group of people from Najeebabad on June
10 with iron traps. During questioning both the accused said they
worked for Bheema Bawaria.

On a tip-off from Wildlife Protection
Society of India, WCCB raided Bheema's house in Rajendra Park police
station area of Gurgaon on July 7.

They recovered one complete
skeleton of tiger, penis, two testicles, tiger fat, two cheetal horns
and a number of traps from the house but Bheema escaped.
