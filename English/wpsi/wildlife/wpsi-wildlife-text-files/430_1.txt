‘Threat to wildlife ignored’ — Maharashtra blackbucks death puts spotlight on roadkill mitigation

 

30 Jan 2023Delhi:
Twelve blackbucks were killed in an accident along the Solapur-Bijapur
highway in Maharashtra Saturday evening, alarming wildlife experts who
have emphasised on the need to implement mitigation measures along
linear projects that interfere with the movement of wildlife.

Linear
projects such as roads and railways are known to cause habitat
fragmentation, making it risky for wild animals to cross over.

According
to deputy conservator of forests, Solapur, Dhairyashil Patil, the
blackbucks fell to their death from a height of approximately 30-to-35
feet as they attempted to cross a newly-constructed bypass road that
cuts through a hill.
