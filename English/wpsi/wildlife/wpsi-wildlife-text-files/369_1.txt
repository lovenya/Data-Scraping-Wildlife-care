Junagadh:

A
day after a lion cub was found trapped in a snare in Gir-Somnath
district of Gujarat, 34 suspected poachers were arrested by the forest
department on Thursday, an official said.

A total of 38 persons
have been arrested so far after a lion cub was found trapped in a snare
on the outskirts of a village on Wednesday, said forest offcial K
Ramesh.

Animal bones, meat and choppers as well as snares were
seized from their possession, he said, adding that the snares were not
big enough to trap full-grown lions.

The accused hunted smaller
animals like jackals and rabbits whose body parts are used to make
traditional medicines, usually sold in roadside tents, he said.

"We
also found a jackal trapped in a snare in the same area on Wednesday.
We then nabbed four suspects from Junagadh when they were trying to
flee and learnt about the involvement of several others," Mr Ramesh
told reporters.
