As corals die, watery grave awaits islands

Much like in many parts of the world, rising sea-surface
temperatures because of global warming, aggressive fishing and
increasing siltation due to deforestation are leading to the death of
corals off India’s coast.

“In terms of diversity, India ranks
fourth with around 21,000 species; the first being New Zealand with
around 26,000 species, followed by China with around 25,000 species,
and Australia, which is home to the great barrier reef with 24,000
species,” said K Venkataraman, former director of Zoological Survey of
India (ZSI), the national centre for survey and exploration of the
fauna across the country. “Some estimates say that by 2050, all the
corals in the world will be dead,” he said.

Corals are among the
oldest ecosystems on earth, coming into existence nearly 500 million
years ago. They also support immense biodiversity — though coral reefs
occupy 0.25% of the surface area of oceans, about 25% of the world’s
fish species are dependent on them. “Worldwide, corals are estimated to
support 3-10 million marine plants and animals, of which only about 1.8
million have been identified,” said Venkataraman.

Corals can
grow under narrow environmental conditions — low level of nutrients,
temperature between 22 and 26°C, salinity between 32 and 38 practical
salinity unit with more than 90% water clarity and oxygen saturation.
