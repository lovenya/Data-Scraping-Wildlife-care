14 Sept 2022A
team of Namibia’s Cheetah Conservation Foundation (CCF) will travel
with eight cheetahs from southern Africa to Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno
National Park on Saturday, culminating the 12-year coordination of the
organisation dedicated to saving the cheetah in the wild with the
Indian authorities and scientists for the translocation project even as
challenges remain.

The cheetahs will be flown first to Jaipur
and then to Kuno. They have been vaccinated, fitted with satellite
collars, and are currently in isolation at CCF Centre in Otjiwarongo.
The cheetahs were selected on the basis of an assessment of health,
wild disposition, hunting skills, and ability to contribute genetics
that will result in a strong founder population.
