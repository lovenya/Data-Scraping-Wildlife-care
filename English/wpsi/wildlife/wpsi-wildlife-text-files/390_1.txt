IUCN World Congress pitches for GIB conservation in India

 

3 Oct 2021

Nagpur:
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World
Conservation Congress has voted in favour of the motion titled
‘Preventing extinction of the Great Indian Bustards (GIBs) in India’.

The
motions are the mechanism by which members of the IUCN influence and
guide the policy and programme of the IUCN, which is the world’s
largest and the most diverse environmental network with more than 1,500
members — including states, government agencies, NGOs, and indigenous
peoples’ organizations — and over 15,000 international experts
associated with its six commissions.

As the only international
conservation forum that brings governments, civil society, and
indigenous peoples’ organizations to the same table, the IUCN members’
assembly carries a powerful mandate. Members vote to approve motions,
and once adopted, they become resolutions and recommendations, and
therefore the body of IUCN’s general policy that guides conservation
strategies across the world.
