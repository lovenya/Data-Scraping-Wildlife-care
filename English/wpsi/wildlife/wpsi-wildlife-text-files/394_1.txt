In Madhya Pradesh, experts meet today on surge in human-elephant conflict

 

6 Dec 2021

Just 11 years
after the first elephant sighting was recorded in Madhya Pradesh, a
seven-member committee of wildlife experts will hold a two-day meeting
in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve starting Monday to look for ways to
address what officials say is a growing problem of human-elephant
conflict. The state recorded a new high of nearly 110 elephants this
year.

After Chhattisgarh was carved out over two decades ago,
Madhya Pradesh had only seven elephants by 2017, according to official
estimates. In 2018, the state became home to a herd of 40 elephants
that settled in the tiger reserve — the herd’s count today is 42.
