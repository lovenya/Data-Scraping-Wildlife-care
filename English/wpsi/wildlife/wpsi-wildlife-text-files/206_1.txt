Two Chinese women have been arrested by the customs officials for
allegedly trying to smuggle out 'Shahtoosh' shawls at Delhi airport,
according to an official statement issued Friday.

A Shahtoosh

region and the Tibetan plateau.

The women -- aged 41 years and
39 years respectively -- were intercepted Thursday when they were
proceeding to board a flight from Delhi to Shanghai, the statement said.


"Fifteen
Shahtoosh shawls were seized by the customs officers from their checked
