Study links booze and chase to jumbo rage

 

6th March 2019

A 10-year
study of elephant attacks on humans in three north Bengal districts has
revealed half of the incidents occurred after dusk when victims were
returning home or were drunk and chasing elephants.

The study by
scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, also suggested
the human-elephant conflicts was less related to abundance of the
animal and more to changes in landscape.

The scientists said
Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts had an elephant
population of 488, or 1.8 per cent of India’s 2017 estimate of 27,312
elephants. But, the study said, the districts had 12 per cent of human
fatalities from elephant attacks.

“These figures tell us changes
in the landscape and human presence influence the severity of
human-elephant conflict more than the density of elephants,” said S
Sathyakumar, a senior WII scientist who led the study published in the
journal PLOS ONE.

Sathyakumar and his colleagues analysed the
circumstances and geographical distribution of 476 deaths and 1,646
injuries caused by elephants in the three districts between 2006 and
2016. They found that 50 per cent of the attacks occurred between 6pm
and midnight.
