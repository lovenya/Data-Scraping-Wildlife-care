We have just received news of the death of five more lions near Gir.
Preliminary information suggests that the three lionesses and two cubs
were electrocuted by a crop protection fence put up by a farmer near
Dhari, Amreli district, in an area adjoining Gir National Park.

                        

This new tragedy brings the number of Gir lions that have died this year to a staggering total of 32 lions:

                        

- 8 lions have died due to poaching

- 6 lions have been electrocuted

- 5 lions died after falling into open wells

- 1 lion was hit by a vehicle

- 12 lions were found dead

                        

"We are shocked by the news today of the death of five more lions in
Gir from electrocution. WPSI is already working closely with the
enforcement authorities to curb the killing of lions by professional
poachers. The Asiatic lion is one of the most critically endangered
species on this planet and this added twist of so many lions being
killed by electrocution from crop protection fencing is a catastrophe",
said Belinda Wright, Executive Director of the Wildlife Protection
Society of India.
