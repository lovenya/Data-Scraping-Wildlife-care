2 lakh trees to be axed for 701-km Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway; MSRDC says it will plant 8 lakh trees

Â

The state government's marquee 701-km Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway will eat up over 2 lakh trees.

A
status report on the project, which was presented at a review meeting
on June 3, said that of the 2,76,050 listed trees, 1,53,744 have
already been axed. Activists called the loss of green cover one of the
biggest in recent times for the project.

The Maharashtra State
Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), the agency that's building the
corridor, has claimed that it would plant 8 lakh trees to compensate
for the loss. "The Wildlife Sanctuary of India, the Botanical Survey of
India and the forest department will monitor the trees for seven years
to ensure their survival. As per the norms of Indian Roads Congress,
583 trees should be planted every 1 km but we will plant 650 trees
every 1 km. We have started planning the plantation, which will be
implemented the next monsoon. We will plant local trees, not exotic
ones to ensure they survive, and also make irrigation arrangements for
all," said Radheshyam Mopalwar, managing director and vice-chairman,
MSRDC.

D Stalin of NGO Vanshakti the 'compensation' will not be
as effective as it's touted to be since the plantation drive will not
immediately result in recovery of the green cover. "Let's assume that
the new plantation does take place. Saplings can't compensate for grown
trees. A deficit of 20 years will remain. Also, how will the government
provide 8 lakh litre of water every day? Is there any concrete plan?"
