5th April 2019

HARIDWAR:
The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Union ministry of
environment and forests (MoEF) to submit a “factual report” within two
months regarding the last remaining Great Indian Bustard (GIB), a
critically endangered bird.

A petition was filed by Centre for
Wildlife and Environment Litigation (CWEL) which had stated that wind
power was a major threat to GIBs and most of the wind power projects
were located in the natural habitats of the birds in Rajasthan,
Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra.Gaurav
Kumar Bansal, advocate appearing for CWEL told TOI, “Due to wind power
lines, millions of birds die every year.” In court, he also drew the
attention of the tribunal to the 30th Forest Advisory Committee report
which talks of placing transmission lines underground in natural
habitats of GIBs.

The bird was listed as a critically endangered
species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in
2013. The IUCN report at that time had pointed out that in the absence
of a proper land distribution policy, the habitat of the bird had been
encroached upon, especially in and around bustard sanctuaries in
Maharashtra and the Kutch region of Gujarat.
