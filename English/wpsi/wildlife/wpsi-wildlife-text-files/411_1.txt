No Mining, Factories Within 1 Km Of Sanctuaries, National Parks: Supreme Court

 

3 June 2022There
can be no mining or factories in a 1-km buffer zone of at least 1 km
around wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, the Supreme Court
ordered on Friday, issuing a slew of directives on regulating
activities in and around eco-sensitive zones (ESZs) across the country.

Manufacturing
and similar activities underway along these zones will go on only with
the permission of the Chief Conservator of Forests, the court ruled.

The
Chief Conservator of each state will prepare a list of existing
structures that come under the ESZ designation and submit it within
three months, the Supreme Court said.

There can be no mining within wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, it added.
