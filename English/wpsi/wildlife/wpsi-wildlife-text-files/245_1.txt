Feeding Wildlife or Feeding Conflict: How Human Subsidy Affects Urban Wildlife

 

18th April 2019

Feeding someone in need is considered philanthropy. And if others benefit from our leftovers, isn’t it a win-win situation?

Not always, say scientists.

Recent
studies say that ‘human subsidy’ is a major driver of the increase in
wildlife-human conflict, especially in urban areas. The rise of urban
sprawls results in increased access to food, shelter and other
resources—collectively called human subsidies—for wildlife. These
subsidies can be intentional (e.g. direct feeding) or unintentional
(e.g. waste dumping, presence of livestock). Wild species, which have
the ability to adapt, choose growing urban settlements for survival
rather than struggling with dwindling forest resources. This is not
just a threat to city-dwelling humans, but also a grave ecological
concern.

“The term ‘human-wildlife conflict’ creates a picture
of unruly, ferocious beasts within human establishments. I suggest
visualising these as dynamic interactions between humans and wild
animals respectively ‘occupying’ rapidly expanding urban spaces and
constantly shrinking wild systems. More often than not, urban
human-wildlife interactions are the result of enormous food subsidies
offered by urban waste and socio-religious acts,” explains Nishant
Kumar, a researcher jointly based at Edward Grey Institute, the
University of Oxford and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).
