23rd June, 2017



There appears to be no let- up in smuggling of live and dead
wildlife. In fact, it has seen a sharp increase as indicated by the
value of seized "wildlife products" being smuggled to China from India
through Nepal and Bhutan.

The rise is 121 per cent so far this year-the highest since 2010.

Among
the species smuggled out of the country live are Tokay gecko lizard,
tortoise, turtle, peacock, hare, mongoose, dove, bulbul and snake sand
boa. The illegal trade also includes body parts of dead animals like
rhino horns, leopard skin and paw, deer horn and skull, rein deer skin,
barking deer skin and elephant trunk.

Data from the Sashastra
Seema Bal (SSB), a paramilitary force that guards the 1,751 km
India-Nepal and the 699 km India-Bhutan border- showed the force seized
wildlife products globally valued at Rs 121.62 crore between January 1
and May 31 this year.

The SSB also arrested 53 smugglers during
this period. The maximum recoveries were made from Assam, West Bengal,
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar-all border states. A Wildlife Protection
Society of India official, Tito Joseph, said the massive increase in
wildlife smuggling was being reported because the SSB on the Nepal and
Bhutan borders and the Assam Rifles in India's east were doing a "very
good job".
