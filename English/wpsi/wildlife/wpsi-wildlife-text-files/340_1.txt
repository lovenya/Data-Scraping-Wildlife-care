After lull of 13 months, poachers kill rhino in Assam’s Kaziranga; steal horn

 

10 May 2020




Poachers
have killed a rhino in Assam’s Kaziranga National Park with an AK-47
assault rifle and taken the animal’s horn, striking after a gap of more
than 13 months, forest department officials said on Sunday.

Discovery
of eight empty shells of an AK-47 assault rifle at the spot where the
rhino’s carcass was found have led forest officials to suspect the role
of some local insurgent groups, who are in possession of such
sophisticated arms.

This is the first instance of rhino poaching
in Kaziranga this year. There was no instance of poaching the 430 sq km
park since April 1, 2019, and it had recorded three poaching deaths
last year.

“The carcass of the adult male rhino was found by our
personnel on Saturday evening at the Agaratoli range of the park with
its horn missing.
