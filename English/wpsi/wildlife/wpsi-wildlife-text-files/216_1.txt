Seven poachers held in Assam 

 

29th December 2018



A team Assam Forest Department and police officers on Friday night
arrested seven people in the Kohora area of Kaziranga National Park and
recovered a large quantity of tiger skin and body parts from them.

Kaziranga
officials said two persons were first arrested after a vehicle, based
on intelligence inputs, was intercepted on the highway along the
national park earlier in the day. Some wildlife body parts were found
in the vehicle.

The duo led the sleuths to the house of one
Dilip Singh at Kohora. A raid yielded more tiger bones and skin there
and five more persons involved in smuggling animal body parts were
arrested.

The arrested seven admitted to having killed a tiger at Anjukpani on the southern edge of Kaziranga.

“They
were in the process of selling the animal body parts to traffickers
when they were caught,” Rohini Ballave Saikia, Divisional Forest
Officer of KNP, said.
