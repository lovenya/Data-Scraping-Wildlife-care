28 Oct 2019



A
female elephant was electrocuted on the night of October 27 after it
reportedly came in contact with a livewire trap laid by farmers in
Bagharatola forest under Rourkela forest division in Odisha’s
Sundargarh district.

The body of the elephant was spotted by
local residents on the morning of October 28. They in turn informed
forest officials, Odisha chief wildlife warden and principal chief
conservator of forests, HS Upadhyaya, said.

The area has
witnessed the deaths of some villagers and widespread damages to houses
and crops by elephants in recent years. It is suspected that the
electric wires were used as fencing to protect farmlands from the
intrusions of elephants.

The officials of the electricity
department committed gross negligence while laying electric wires
through sanctuaries and forests in the state. They should have
enveloped the electric wires passing through forests according to the
guidelines of the government, the forest officer added.

On June 10 this year, three elephants were electrocuted in the Borapada forest of Dhenkanal district.
