Three elephants were electrocuted near the Dudhwa wildlife sanctuary on the Nighasan-Palia road here today.

Forest
officials said the tuskers were burnt alive when an 11,000 volt high
tension wire fell on them when they uprooted a pole in Bodihya Kala
village.

However, the officials were probing the death as a few
days back these elephants had damaged huge quantities of agricultural
produce and the farmers were demanding compensation from the government.

The
bodies of elephants would be sent for post-mortem examination, the
officials said while senior police and forest officials have rushed to
the spot.
