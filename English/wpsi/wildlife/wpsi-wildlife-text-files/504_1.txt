IUCN Urges 
                        Continued Prohibition of Shahtoosh Trade 
                        
                        29th Nov, 2004
                         The IUCN World Conservation 
                          Congress passed a motion on 25 November 2004, urging 
                          the "continued prohibition of shahtoosh production 
                          and trade". The Motion was passed by a virtually 
                          unanimous vote by Members of the World Conservation 
                          Union, both government and non-government, on the final 
                          day of the Congress.
                        "We are delighted by the overwhelming support 
                          of the world's premier conservation body, and to be 
                          a part of this historic motion", said Belinda Wright, 
                          Executive Director of the Wildlife Protection Society 
                          of India, who attended the World Conservation Congress 
                          as a Member of IUCN.
                        The shahtoosh motion was sponsored by four Members 
                          of IUCN - Wildlife Conservation Society (USA), Fauna 
                          and Flora International (UK), Conservation International 
                          (USA), and Wildlife Protection Society of India.
                        The Motion noted that the production and illegal trade 
                          in shahtoosh remains a threat to the survival of the 
                          Tibetan antelope and commended the governments of India 
                          and China for their commitment to the protection of 
                          the Tibetan antelope. The World Conservation Congress 
                          urged the maintenance of a strict ban on hunting of 
                          the Tibetan Antelope and the sale of its fur, and the 
                          production of shahtoosh. The Congress further urged 
                          "the government of India to prepare a road map 
                          for the protection of the Tibetan antelope and for the 
                          government, its legal institutions, and its wildlife 
                          laws to remain obligated to continue to enforce the 
                          ban on the shahtoosh processing and trade; and under 
                          no circumstances to lift the ban". Lastly, the 
                          Congress called upon consumer countries to ensure effective 
                          enforcement to stop the trade in shahtoosh."
                        In the largest conservation gathering in history, the 
                          Congress - which was held in Bangkok - was attended 
                          by over 6,000 delegates from 160 countries.
