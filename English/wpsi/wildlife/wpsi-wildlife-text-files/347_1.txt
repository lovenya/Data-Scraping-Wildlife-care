29 July 2020



In
another big seizure of exotic animals in Assam and a foiled attempt by
smugglers to slip across borders, the Cachar Forest Division on Tuesday
confiscated a consignment of exotic wildlife, including a baby
kangaroo, a pair of Capuchin monkeys and six Hyacinth macaws, species
of parrot native to South America.

“We have taken the custody of
these animals and they are currently in Silchar. Our vets are
monitoring their health and their condition is found to be good. But
the Hyacinth macaws are very delicate, so we have decided to get all
the animals to Assam State Zoo today,” said Sunnydeo Choudhary,
Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Cachar, adding that the two drivers of
the seized truck would be produced in court and soon after the
proceedings, the animals would be transported to Assam zoo.
