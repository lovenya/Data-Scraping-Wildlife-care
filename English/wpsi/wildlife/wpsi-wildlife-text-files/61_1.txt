Jumbo refuses to let her dead calves go
Â 
Hassan, Jan 6, DHNS :

In
a heart-rending incident, an elephant refused to move away from the
carcasses of its dead calves and stood beside them the whole day,
protecting them and moving them, in the hope that they will come back
to life again.

The incident occurred at Vatepur of Alur taluk in Hassan district in the wee hours on Thursday. 

The
two calves, a one-and-a-half-year-old male calf and a five-month-old
female, were moving with their herd, when they reportedly died from
electrocution. Villagers informed the forest department when they
spotted the mother elephant in the paddy field belonging to a farmer,
Poovaiah. 

The mother elephant stood protecting the dead calves
and did not allow anybody to approach the carcasses. Though the mother
left the place when the forest staff burst crackers, it returned after
it saw an earthmover coming closer to the carcasses and pushed it away.
The officials are planning to wait till Friday morning for the elephant
to leave the place.
