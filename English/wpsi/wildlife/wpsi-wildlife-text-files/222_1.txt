Gurgaon: Another leopard death prompts fresh calls for animal corridor

 

31st Jan., 2019


Officials
said the incident took place around 8 pm, around 1 km from the Pali
police post on the Faridabad side. “The death of a female sub-adult
leopard was reported… on Saturday night. Traffic police removed the
carcass from the spot and wildlife officials were informed. A
post-mortem was done on January 27,” said Vinod Kumar, Additional
Principal Chief Conservator of Forests.

Officials said the
medical team which conducted the autopsy reported “severe internal
injuries” and “ruptured organs”, leading to the suspicion that the
animal was run over by a heavy vehicle. “We cremated the remains on
Sunday. A cremation by burning is preferred, as it eliminates any
chance of the body being exhumed or organs being taken by locals,” said
Kumar.

This is not the first incident of a leopard being run
over on busy roads in Gurgaon. In May 2015, an eight-month-old female
leopard was found dead along the same stretch, with officials claiming
the animal appeared to have died after a head-on collision with a
passing vehicle. In another incident, a 12-year-old male leopard was
found dead near Manesar, with officials saying it was hit by a vehicle.
