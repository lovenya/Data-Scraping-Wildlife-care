Wild
elephants spread panic across three villages in Odisha Friday night and
Saturday morning, killing three persons including a 7-year-old child
and injuring another, pushing the toll of human casualties in
man-animal conflict to an all-time high of 85, officials said.

In 2017-18, 84 people were killed by elephants.

In
Dhenkanal district, the ground-zero of man-elephant conflict, a
65-year-old man was trampled by an elephant while going to village pond
for a bath. Dayanidhi Sahu was attacked by an elephant and died on the
sport, said Dhenkanal divisional forest officer Sudarshan Patra. Angry
locals later staged a road blockade on National Highway 55 near the
village demanding compensation for family members of the deceased.

In
Deulabeda area of neighbouring Angul district, 80-year-old Kedar Nath
Prasad was going to a shop when a tusker allegedly attacked and
trampled him to death on the spot. Locals alleged that two tuskers had
strayed into the area from Mahabiroad forest range on February 28, one
of which attacked Kedar Nath.
