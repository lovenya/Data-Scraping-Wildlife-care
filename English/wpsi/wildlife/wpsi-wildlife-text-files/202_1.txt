Turtles lose to coastal projects in Gujarat and Odisha

 

4th Oct., 2018



The race was between the slow-moving turtles and the industrial projects for India’s fast developing economy – the latter won.

The
expert panels of the Indian government’s Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) have recently recommended green
clearances for two separate projects that involve nesting grounds for
olive ridley turtles. The nod for green clearances may not spell
happiness for the turtles even though the expert committees have tried
to ensure the highest safety for the marine creatures.  

One
of the projects that has sought environmental and CRZ clearance is the
development of a multi-product Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and a Free
Trade Warehousing Zone (FTWZ) in Kutch district of Gujarat, estimated
to cost Rs. 392.43 billion (Rs. 39,243 crore).

The SEZ
industrial project covers 3147.7 acres and includes a thermal power
plant, a gas-based power plant and other units.
