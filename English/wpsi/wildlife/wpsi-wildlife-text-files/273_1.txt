Kozhikode:
The forest road from Sultan Bathery to Pulpally, where the viral video
of a tiger chasing a motorcycle was shot last Saturday, has witnessed
two more incidents of motorists having run-ins with wildlife.

A
KSRTC bus from Perikalloor to Kozhikode was attacked by a wild elephant
on the road just one km away from Vattapadi, the location of tiger
chase, on Wednesday morning. The tusker tore the front grill of the bus
and damaged the vehicle’s air cooler. The driver had stopped the bus on
seeing the elephant on the road, according to officials. But the tusker
charged at the vehicle twice and it retreated only after panicked
passengers raised noise from inside the bus.

The bus was later brought to the Sulthan Bathery depot and the passengers were shifted to another bus to continue their journey.
