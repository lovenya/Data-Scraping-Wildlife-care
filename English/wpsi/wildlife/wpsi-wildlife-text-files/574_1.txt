                        On the eve
of Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to India, twelve NGOs from
around the word including three NGOs in India - WWF, WPSI, and WTI -
have issued a joint statement to express their concern about the
present tiger crisis. In particular, the statement urges China not to
reopen the trade in tiger products, as "to allow any trade from any
source under any circumstances at this point in time would mark a
further step towards the extinction of wild tigers".

                        

The group also released a document on Tiger Trade Facts and Fallacies
that many of you might find interesting. Please help save wild tigers
by getting the information out to as wide an audience as possible.
