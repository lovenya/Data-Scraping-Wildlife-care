A tiger skin was seized on Monday, 21 January 2008, in the southern
hill station of Munnar, in Kerala. Acting on information provided by
the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), the operation was led
by Mr Pradeep, Intelligence DFO of the Vigilance Wing of the Kerala
Forest Department.

                        

The skin was of a sub-adult tiger and it is suspected that the animal
was killed in the Nilgiri forests two months ago. Four people were
arrested, while two others ran away from the scene after throwing down
a package, which included the fresh skin of a leopard cat. The case has
been handed over to the Munnar Forest Division and the accused will be
produced in the Devikulam court on Tuesday.

                        

On the same day, WPSI assisted in a second raid near Rishikesh in the
northern state of Uttarakhand. Leopard bones, leopard claws and deer
antlers were seized by the Anti-poaching cell of the Uttarakhand Forest
Department. One person was arrested.
