DEATH SENTENCE 
                        FOR SMUGGLING ANIMAL SKINS  
                        
                        8th Oct., 2004
                        In a landmark judgment 
                          on 5 October 2004, a Chinese court sentenced two people 
                          to death and another person to life imprisonment for 
                          smuggling 1,400 skins of endangered animals in Tibet’s 
                          Ngamring county.

                          

                          This sentence has come a year after the Anti-Smuggling 
                          Bureau of the People’s Republic of China made 
                          the shocking seizure of illegal skins on 8 October 2003. 
                          The haul included 31 tiger skins, 581 leopard skins 
                          and 778 otter skins and was valued at US$7.6 million.

                          

                          The Lhasa intermediate court sentenced the Chinese leader 
                          of the group, Wang Jie, to death while Gongbu (aka Gonpo), 
                          a native Tibetan, was sentenced to death with a two-year 
                          reprieve. The third culprit, another Tibetan Laba Ciren 
                          (aka Lhakpa Tsering), was given a life sentence.

                          

                          This news comes as issues of wildlife enforcement are 
                          being hotly debated by the 166 signatory nations to 
                          the Convention on International Trade of Endangered 
                          Species (CITES) in Bangkok. A report released at CITES 
                          by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has 
                          documented the flourishing illicit trade of big cat 
                          skins between India, Nepal and China, with special reference 
                          to the seizure in Tibet last year.
