NGT junks government order easing mining rules

 

27th Sep., 2018



The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has overruled the Union
environment ministry’s three 2016 notifications that exempted mining of
minor minerals like sand in up to 25 ha area from prior public
consultation and the environmental impact assessment (EIA).

“EIA
is an integral and most critical component of environmental clearance
as it is only through the EIA that the potential impacts and potential
risks of a project can be assessed and mitigation measures
formulated…,’’ an NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel-led bench said in
its order on Tuesday.

“…by exempting EIA and environmental
management plan, critical environmental aspects like anticipated
impacts, mitigation measures and additional studies involving public
consultation, risk assessment, social impact, rehabilitation and
resettlement action plans stand exempted.”

The bench noted that
the ministry’s notifications were in conflict with the 2016 sustainable
sand mining guidelines, which said an EIA should address the
environmental impacts of minor mineral mining.
