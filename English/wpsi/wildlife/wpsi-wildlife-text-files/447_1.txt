Kolkata: Notorious poacher Rikoch
Narjari, a most-wanted outlaw in the northeast, has been arrested in
the Kamrup district of Assam.

                        

Narjari, who also goes by the names of Devid Guite and Damra, was
arrested on Tuesday by the joint effort of Bengal’s forest force and
Assam’s forest and police personnel. He was brought to Bengal on
Wednesday.

                        

Narjari is allegedly behind multiple rhino poaching incidents in
Jaldapara National Park since 2014 and has connections with
international smuggling networks.“Rikoch is the biggest poacher of this
generation. With his arrest, we hope to bust his entire poaching
racket. His arrest is an example of a collective cross-border action
against poaching,” said Debal Roy, Bengal’s chief wildlife warden and
principal chief conservator of forest.
