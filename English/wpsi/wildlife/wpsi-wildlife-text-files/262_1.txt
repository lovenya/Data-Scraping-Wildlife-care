India to be the next hotspot for pangolin poaching: Biologist

 

22 June 2019




Kolkata,
Jun 19 (UNI) India could be the next hot spot for Pangolin poachers
after African nations, according to Prof Samuel K Wasser, Director
Centre for Conservation Biology, University of Washington.

Speaking
at a Media Roundtable here at the American Center on Tuesday, Prof
Wasser said pangolin trade may have just surpassed international
illegal ivory trade and is estimated at USD 4 billion annually.

India,
which is home to at least two species of pangolin-- Manis crassicaudata
and Chinese Pangolin M. pentadactyla--is going to be the next target of
international wildlife criminal organisations as Africa could be soon
depleted of pangolins, he opined.

The biologist said there is
very little awareness about this shy animal, which is also the most
trafficked animal in the world, mainly for its scales that are believed
to cure "anything from acne to cancer" in Southeast Asian countries.

Dr
Wasser and his team has been collecting pangolin scats for DNA mapping
in Vietnam and Nepal with the help of sniffer dogs and the DNA so
extracted is added to the pangolin genetics map.
