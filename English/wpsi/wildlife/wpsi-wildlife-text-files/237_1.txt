ERODE: A
massive fire broke out in the Kermalam reserve forest in the
Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) here on Thursday, destroying nearly
300 acres forest land.

“We are trying our best to put out the fire. However, it would take at least two days,” a senior forest officer said.

The fire first broke out at Gethesal and soon spread to Mavallam and Kottarai villages in the Kermalam reserve forest.

According
to the officer, flames have engulfed the forest area between Asanur and
Kermalam. “The fire first broke out at Gethesal and soon spread to
Mavallam and Kottarai villages in the Kermalam reserve forest.”

He
said huge trees and herbal plants were completely destroyed, and
electric poles and live wires were damaged in the fire. “Exact details
could be ascertained only after two days.”

The officer said road transportation between Asanur and Kollegal via Kermalam was stopped since (Thursday) morning.

Following
the fire, the forest department has closed all forest roads. As a
result, Kermalam village was completely cut off from other hamlets and
villages in the area.
