Leopard Seizure by 
                        Maharashtra Tiger Cell 
                        
                        21st October, 2003
                        On 11 October 2003 
                          a team of the Tiger Cell from Gondia, Maharashtra, with 
                          the assistance of WPSI, arrested five poachers and seized 
                          two leopard skins. The Tiger Cell team, led by Assistant 
                          Police Inspector G. R. Kankale, conducted the raids 
                          in the Chichgarh area that adjoins Navergaon National 
                          Park.
                        The 
                          area has a strong naxalite presence, which made the 
                          seizure extremely challenging. Naxalites in the area 
                          have been known to shelter and facilitate poachers, 
                          and the enforcement authorities have been unable to 
                          pursue cases in the past due to the threat faced from 
                          these extremist groups. 
                       The accused were produced before the Judicial Magistrate 
                          in Sakoli, on 12 October, who remanded them to police 
                          custody.
