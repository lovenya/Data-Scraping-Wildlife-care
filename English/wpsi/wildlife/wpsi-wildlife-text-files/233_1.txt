2 Lion Cubs Found Dead In Gir Forest, Initial Probe Hints At Infighting

 

6th March 2019

Ahmedabad: Two lion cubs were Tuesday found dead in Visavadar range of Gujarat's Gir forest, a senior official said.

Preliminary
probe has revealed the two cubs, around five months old, may have been
killed by a male lion in a territorial fight to establish dominance,
said DT Vasavada, Chief Conservator of Forests, Junagadh Wildlife
Circle.

Earlier last month, two lions, a lioness and a cub were
found dead in and around the Gir forest, the only abode of Asiatic
lions.

As per the last census conducted in 2015, it is home to
523 lions, though a recent government announcement put the number at
600.

During the Gujarat Assembly session held last month, the
state government had said 204 lions, comprising 110 adults and 94 cubs,
had died in and around Gir forest in the last two years as on December,
2018.

Of these, 21 lions and six cubs died of unnatural causes
like falling into open wells or being hit by trains, the House was
informed. .
