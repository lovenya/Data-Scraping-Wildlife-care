Shock and awe: Elephants in the killing fields of Odisha

 

20 Nov 2022In
October 2018, a big herd of elephants walked past Kamalanga village in
Dhenkanal. Some members of the group came in contact with a
high-voltage live wire. Social and sentient as they are, other
elephants of the herd tried to help those in distress only to pay with
their lives. That was the biggest elephant electrocution tragedy in the
state - seven elephants perished in one go.

Four years hence,
very little seems to have changed on the ground. Odisha government may
have been pumping in crores of rupees to give safe passage to wild
elephants but power lines are one of the biggest unnatural killers of
the gentle giants.
