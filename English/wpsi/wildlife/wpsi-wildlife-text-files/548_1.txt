Some good news, for a change !


10th Feb., 2006



We have just heard that Radio Free
Asia (RFA) reported today (9 February) that a man burnt his wildlife
skin chuba publicly on a road in Lhasa on 2 February, and that many
Tibetan people supported him. The RFA report also said that Tibetans in
Rabkong, Qinghai Province, are planning to publicly burn their wildlife
skins on 12 February. The local Chinese authorities have supported this
campaign, although an officer has ordered that there be no publicity or
large gathering of people. In Karze, a Kham place near Litang, many
Tibetans decided not to wear their skin chubas at the recent local
festivals, and prices for wildlife skins there have dropped
dramatically.

                        

News of the disastrous consequences of the skin trade and His Holiness
the Dalai Lama's condemnation of the use of skins appears to be
spreading across Tibet. Let us hope that more and more people take a
stand.
