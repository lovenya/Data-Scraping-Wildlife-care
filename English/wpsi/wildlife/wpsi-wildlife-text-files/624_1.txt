A
notorious tiger poacher, Dariya, was arrested by the Katni Forest
Department on 27 November 2008, with information and assistance
provided by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI).

Dariya
was apprehended at the Katni Railway Station in a joint operation of
the Forest Department and WPSI. He had in his possession a tiger trap,
a leopard trap, a knife and other poaching equipment. The bail
application of Dariya was rejected by the Judicial Magistrate of Katni
on 5 December 2008.

Dariya has been arrested in a number of
wildlife cases throughout India in the past. In July 2000, two leopard
skins were seized from his residence by police in Pinjore, Haryana. In
November 2005, he was arrested again at Katerniaghat Wildlife Division,
Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, with poaching equipment and served a five and a
half month jail term from 2005 to 2006, in Bahraich, UP. After being
released from jail in Bahraich, he was an accused in a case involving
the seizure of a fresh tiger skin in December 2006 on the Indo-Nepal
border by the paramilitary personnel of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).
The tiger is thought to have been killed in Valmiki Tiger Reserve.
Dariya is an absconder in this case and is still wanted by the Bihar
authorities.

By coincidence, another tiger poacher by the name
of Dariya was arrested in Corbett Tiger Reserve in April 2008. These
are two separate individuals.
