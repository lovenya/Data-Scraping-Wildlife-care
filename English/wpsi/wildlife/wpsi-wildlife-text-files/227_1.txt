Of 630 wildlife offences, 20 saw convictions in Kerala since 2000: CAG 

 

15th Feb., 2019

In the
past 17 years, Kerala has registered 630 wildlife offences and of them
only 20 have seen convictions, according to report by Comptroller and
Auditor General (CAG) of India.

The auditors found this by
collating data from 10 wildlife divisions in the state since 2000.
“Some of the reasons for the low rate of convictions were inability of
the investigating officers to gather and produce proper and sufficient
evidences to establish the crime, failure in producing the articles
seized at the crime spot, and procedural lapses,” says the report.

According
to the forest code, when a forest official below the rank of range
officer (RO) detects a forest offence, he should submit a detailed
report to the RO within 24 hours. Then, the RO has to conduct an
enquiry and submit a report to the Divisional Forest Officer
(DFO).  

Of the 630 offences registered, 71 saw
acquittals, 144 were either dropped or compounded and 395 are pending
(230 in court and 165 at divisional level).

The audit also found
that the Wayanad wildlife division booked 26 cases under the Kerala
Forest Act, instead of the Wildlife Protection Act, thereby reducing
the gravity of these offences.

To this, the Kerala government
said regular refresher courses were being conducted by the state forest
institutes regarding wildlife crime investigation and the trend was
changing.
