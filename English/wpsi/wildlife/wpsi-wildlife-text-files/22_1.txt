The
Special Task Force (STF) of Uttarakhand Police Department assisted by
Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), arrested one person and
two leopard skins were recovered from him in the Vasant Vihar area of
Dehradun today.

The accused hailing from Chamoli district of
Uttarakhand together with a co-accused currently absconding, poisoned
the mule killed by the leopards. They later skinned the two leopards
and stored the skins in order to make an opportunistic profit from the
sale.

WPSI's wildlife crime database shows that in the year 2009
alone, 39 leopard skins have been seized across the country by various
enforcement agencies.
