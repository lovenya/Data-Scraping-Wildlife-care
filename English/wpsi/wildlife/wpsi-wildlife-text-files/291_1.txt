CITES conference to strengthen wildlife trade rules for fisheries, timber, exotic pets, elephants and more

The 183
Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) will adopt decisions and resolutions to
expand and further strengthen the global wildlife trade regime at
CITES’ triennial World Wildlife Conference at Palexpo in Geneva from 17
to 28 August.

Governments have submitted 56 new proposals to
change the levels of protection that CITES provides for species of wild
animals and plants that are in international trade. Many of these
proposals seek to ensure that trade in at-risk species remains
sustainable by requiring trade permits through a CITES Appendix II
listing.  Others recommend banning all commercial trade in
specimens of species threatened by extinction by listing them on
Appendix I. Still others aim to provide evidence that a population has
stabilized or expanded and can be safely transferred from Appendix I to
Appendix II.

“CITES sets the rules for international trade in
wild fauna and flora. It is a powerful tool for ensuring sustainability
and responding to the rapid loss of biodiversity – often called the
sixth extinction crisis – by preventing and reversing declines in
wildlife populations.
