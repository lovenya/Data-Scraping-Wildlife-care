The illegal wildlife trade is booming, with serious consequences for
biodiversity – the variety of life on Earth.

                        

Wildlife crime is now one of the world’s biggest and most profitable
crime sectors, warns INTERPOL, the world’s largest international police
organization.

                        

This illegal trade is causing “incalculable damage” to biodiversity and
communities, it adds, and is pushing many species to the “brink of
extinction”.

The illegal wildlife trade involves hunting, gathering and trading
endangered species and protected wildlife, including plants and
animals, either dead or alive.
