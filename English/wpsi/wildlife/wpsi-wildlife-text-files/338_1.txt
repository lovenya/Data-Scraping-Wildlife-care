India’s National Board for Wildlife Is a Big Threat to India’s Wildlife

 

26 April 2020




At
the peak of India’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown, when almost all
government offices were shut, one government ministry (other than the
health ministry) kept its doors open. This was the Ministry of
Environment, Forests and Climate Change.

On April 7, the
standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), and on
April 15 the expert appraisal committee (EAC) held meetings through
video conference, facilitated by Union environment minister Prakash
Javadekar. As a result, the ministry could well have become an example
for the world’s countries to emulate, on maintaining focus on national
environmental issues despite the unfolding tragedy. However, this was
not to be.

The standing committee of the NBWL met less for the purpose of protecting and conserving wildlife and more for the opposite.
