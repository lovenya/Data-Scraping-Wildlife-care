109 Leopard Skins seized 
                        in Nepal 
                        
                        8th April, 2003
                         The Nepal Police 
                          seized 109 leopard skins along with 14 unidentified 
                          skins (which we believe could be otter skins) from a 
                          bus in Swayambhu, Kathmandu, during a routine check. 
                          The skins were packed in 11 sacks and the bus was bound 
                          for Dhading. One person, Pasang Chimkel Lama, who was 
                          carrying the parcels, was arrested. Lama told the authorities 
                          that a Tibetan man had asked him to carry the sacks 
                          to the Tibetan border via Dhading and Chhekemar, and 
                          that he was paid Rs. 50,000 to carry the goods.
                        This seizure follows close on the heels 
                          of a number of other large leopard skin seizures in 
                          India. On 1 April, 14 leopard skins and a tiger skin 
                          were seized in Dharchula (Pithoragarh District) on the 
                          India-Nepal border, 20 leopard skins were seized in 
                          Siliguri on 11 February, and 12 leopard skins were seized 
                          in Lucknow on 5 January.
                        This makes a total of 155 leopard skins 
                          seized in the past three months.
