Indian tigers key to global tiger recovery?

Indians
have always taken pride in their tigers. So every time the dwindling
tiger count comes to the fore, there's a national uproar. But now
there's one more compelling reason to save Indian tigers.

New
research in today's issue of the open source journal PLoS Genetics
shows that tigers in the Indian subcontinent retain 60-70% of global
genetic variability, despite evidence of a relatively recent and
potentially human-induced population crash 200 years ago. The findings
suggest the subcontinent tigers may be a worthy focus of conservation.

The
research has been done by a team from the National Centre for
Biological Sciences, Bangalore, the Wildlife Conservation Society, New
York and Centre for Wildlife Studies, Bangalore.

Tigers are a globally threatened species with only around 3,000 surviving in just 7% of their historical range.

The
genetic tool , which Mint reported earlier, has been pioneered by Uma
Ramakrishnan and her team who collected non‐invasive fecal samples from
73 individual tigers across varied habitats in the Indian subcontinent
to obtain genetic data. The comparison of genetic diversity within and
outside the Indian subcontinent revealed that Indian tigers retain more
than half of the extant variation. The authors attribute this high
genetic diversity to a historically large population size of about
58,200 tigers for peninsular India south of the Gangetic plains.

In
the global context of tiger conservation, these results suggest that
tigers in the Indian subcontinent are critically important for the
future survival and recovery of the species.
