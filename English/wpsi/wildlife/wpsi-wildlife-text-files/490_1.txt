Tiger Skin Seizure 
                        in Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu 
                        
                        2nd August, 2004
                        Bullet ridden skins 
                          of a tiger and a Giant Malabar squirrel were seized 
                          by the Special Task Force (STF) of the Tamil Nadu Police 
                          on 28 July 2004, in the Nilgiri North Forest Division. 
                          

                          

                          According to preliminary reports received by Wildlife 
                          Protection Society of India (WPSI), the STF carried 
                          out the seizure in the Segur Range of the Nilgiri North 
                          Forest Division. Two persons belonging to the Theni 
                          district of Tamil Nadu were arrested with a gun and 
                          an axe, while two others managed to escape carrying 
                          another gun. Initial investigations have revealed that 
                          the gang entered the forest to kill a tusker, but opportunistically 
                          killed the first tiger they saw.

                          

                          The case has now been handed over to the Forest Department 
                          and the accused have been sent to 15 days judicial custody. 
                          WPSI is assisting the enforcement authorities to file 
                          a case against the poachers. 

                          

                          Recently, there have been disturbing reports about rising 
                          incidents of poaching in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, 
                          and this incident underscores the fact that some of 
                          our most important forests still face a severe poaching 
                          threat.
