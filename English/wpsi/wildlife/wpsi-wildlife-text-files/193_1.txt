Finning
is a cruel practice that sees fishermen slice off shark fins while they
are alive and dump the bleeding fish back into the water.

New
Delhi: A Kerala firm has been accused of using the state high court to
get around a central government ban on the grisly practice of shark
finning, which involves cutting off their characteristic fin while the
fish are alive and exporting it.

Kochi-based Marine Finns, which
exports about 15 tonnes of shark fins a year, has been accused of
seeking repeated exceptions from the Kerala High Court to continue with
the banned trade by claiming it was dealing with old stock.

While
there is not much of a market for shark fins in India, they are
considered a delicacy in China and southeast Asia, where it is used in
soup.

The fin itself is believed to be tasteless cartilage, but
taste for the chicken-broth-based soup has flourished on account of its
projection as a status symbol.

Sharks use the fin to swim and steer themselves.

More
often than not, after the fins are removed, the shark is discarded back
into the ocean, rendering it incapable of swimming. As a result, the
shark sinks to the bottom of the ocean and invariably dies of
suffocation, starvation, blood loss, or is eaten by other predators.Read full story here
