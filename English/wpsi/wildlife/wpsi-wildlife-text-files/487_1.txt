Elephants Killed in 
                        Train Accidents 
                        
                        21st June, 2004
                        A female elephant 
                          and two calfs were killed early this morning after a 
                          goods train rammed into a herd of elephants 15 to 20 
                          km from Dispur, the 
                          capital of the North Eastern state of Assam. The accident 
                          happened near the suburb of Azara, not far from the 
                          Guwahati airport. 
                        There have been earlier problems on this train route 
                          when a wild herd abandoned a young elephant calf because 
                          of disturbance. The calf was later taken into captivity. 
                          Accidents that resulted in the deaths of a number of 
                          elephants have also occurred in Upper Assam.
                        The Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI) believes that this shocking 
                          new incident requires the immediate attention of the 
                          Railway Ministry and Project Elephant, to address the 
                          problem of train lines that cut through elephant corridors.
