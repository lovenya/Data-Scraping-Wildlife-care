The
Forest Department with the help of two wildlife NGOs has nabbed two
persons in Pithoragarh and recovered five leopard pelts and bones of
two big cats from them.

One of the men arrested with this
wildlife contraband is Gopi Bawaria, the younger brother of notorious
big cat poacher Tota Ram Bawaria. The department is working on some
leads from the arrested men and is expected to seize one more leopard
pelt soon. Chief conservator of forests, Kumaon Circle, Param Jit
Singh, who is presently holding the additional charge of the State
anti-poaching cell director, informed that two persons had been
arrested with the wildlife contraband and based on leads from them one
more pelt was expected to be seized soon.

Gopi had confessed
that he had poached two leopards himself and sourced the pelts of three
others from locals. Singh appealed that locals, especially in rural
areas should inform the department about arrival of outsiders with a
dubious interest in the wildlife to help clamp down on poaching.
Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) and the Endangered Flora
and Fauna on Earth Conservation Team (EFFECT) also helped in the
seizure along with the Kumaon circle forest department SOG Kumaon
Eagles and staff of the Pithoragarh forest division.
