Rhino horn and ivory seized in North Bengal


1 November 2006

                        

The West Bengal Forest Department seized one rhino horn, two pieces of
ivory and two swamp deer skins from two men on the Torsa River Bridge,
on the night of 27 October 2006.

                        

Led by Range Officer Jayanta Mondal, a team of forest officials acted
as decoy buyers to arrest the two wildlife traders who are residents of
Alipurduar. During interrogation, the men claimed to have sourced the
articles from Manas, in the neighbouring state of Assam. They are now
in judicial custody for further investigation.

                        

Worryingly, there have been two other important wildlife seizures from
the same region this year. On 14 July, 1 full tiger skeleton, 16 kg
rhino skins and 4 leopard skins were seized from known wildlife trader
Ratiram Sharma. On 25 July, Ratiramâ€™s son was arrested with 1
tiger skin and 3 leopard skins while trying to flee India across the
Bhutan border.

                        

In the meanwhile, Nepal has reported three rhino deaths in the last two
weeks, the most recent one being an electrocution case near Chitwan
National Park.
