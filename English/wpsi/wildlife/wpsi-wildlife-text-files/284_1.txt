India
lost 60 elephants and eight tigers to train accidents in the last three
years as several railway tracks run through forest areas, the
Environment Ministry told Parliament on Monday.

Responding to a
query on death of animals due to train accidents, Union Environment
Minister Prakash Javadekar said movement of wild animals in search of
food and water brings them in close proximity to railway lines, leading
to accidental deaths.

According to the data provided by the
minister, 60 elephants, eight tigers and one lion were killed in train
accidents between 2016 and 2018-19.

"Rail tracks do pass through
forest areas also. Movement of wild animals in search of food and
water, brings them in very close proximity to railway lines and at
times, leads to accidental deaths.

"The state/Union
territories'' Forest Departments manage the forest and wildlife
habitats with cooperation of other sectors," Javadekar told the Rajya
Sabha in a written reply.

The ministry said it has no plan to
remove railway tracks from forest areas but several measures have been
taken to track animal movement around railway track, especially that of
lion.

"Adequate number of trackers have been deployed for day-night patrolling to watch lion movement along railway tracks.
