CHENNAI: Customs officials at the Chennai airport last week seized 32 kg of dried sea horses sent by Speed Post.

                        

Commissioner of Customs (Airport) C. Rajan said four parcels were
brought for despatch to Bangkok by a Thai Airways flight last Friday.
Two of these parcels were declared `saris' with a value of Rs. 1, 500
while the other two were not declared.

                        

One of the parcels had the consignor's address as P. Raja, Burma
Bazaar, Chennai, and another was booked in the name of Nainar of
Chennai. Investigation revealed that both the addresses were bogus.

                        

"Not checked"

                        

A senior Customs officer said postal authorities had not checked the
contents while accepting the goods. However, a seal affixed claimed the
parcel was accepted in "open condition."

                        

Sea horses are listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act,
1972, which bans use of marine life for commercial purposes.

                        

The species is also protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

                        

Mr. Rajan said the seized material would fetch Rs 4.95 lakh.

                        

The parcels were brought from Ramanathapuram district.
