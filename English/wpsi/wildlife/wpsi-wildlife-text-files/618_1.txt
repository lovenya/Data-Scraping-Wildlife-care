GURGAON/NEW DELHI: A complete tiger skeleton was recovered from
a residential premises at Surat Nagar in Gurgaon on Monday afternoon
following a combined raid by the Gurgaon police and officials of the
Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.

A senior official of the Bureau
said: “The raid was carried out following a tip-off from a
non-government organisation working in the field of wildlife
conservation. We raided the residence and found a complete tiger
skeleton and traps used by poachers to capture wild animals in the
forest. The skeleton weighs over 10 kg.”

Wildlife Protection
Society of India’s Executive Director Belinda Wright said: “One of
our informers told us about illegal tiger products being kept at the
Surat Nagar residence and we passed
on this information to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau which acted
very fast and raided the place in the afternoon. The team had two
members from our non-government organisation besides government
officials.”

“Crucial recovery”

“This is a very crucial
and important recovery. The skin of the tiger has not been recovered
and we fear that it might have already been sold off,” she added.

No arrests have been made in the case so far.
