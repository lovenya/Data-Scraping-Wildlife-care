50% of tiger reserves in bad shape

The
country’s big cats are most vulnerable in their own homes. A study by
the ministry of environment and forests has found that 16 of the
country’s 37 tiger reserves (that’s about 50%) are in terrible
condition. The reserves were mainly graded on density of tiger
population.

“The study takes into account the density of tigers
in each reserve and how well protected they are,” said Jairam Ramesh,
the minister for environment and forest. “In all reserves, tiger
density is low or very low,” said the minister.

There has been a
steady decline in India’s tiger population, with more than 100 tigers
dying in the past three years. The 2007 census on the big cats revealed
that there were only 1,411 left in the country. Reserves exclusive to
the big cats, such as Panna in Madhya Pradesh and Sariska in Rajasthan,
fared no better. A majority of tigers in them was either poached or
they killed in man-animal conflicts, which incidentally is the second
most important cause for tiger deaths in the country.

Sariska is
so short of tigers that the Centre has decided to send there two big
cats from the Ranthambore reserve in Rajasthan. Panna. where 30 tigers
died in the past one year, is just as depleted.

To prevent
further damage, tiger reserves are working on an elaborate security
plan to protect theit inhabitants. “We have asked officials from each
reserve to prepare a detailed security plan that can be implemented in
six months. We will also run a security audit of the original plan at
the end of the six month period,” said a source in the ministry.
