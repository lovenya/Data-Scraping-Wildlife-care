Shocked Simlipal to tighten security

BHUBANESWAR:
Scared of public backlash and possible administrative action, forest
officials tried to underplay Monday's mass slaughter of elephants in
Simlipal, but could not succeed. Contrary to their initial claims that
all the three jumbos were females, one has been found to be a male,
bringing to the fore the presence of well organised gangs of poachers
in the biosphere reserve famous for Asian elephants and Royal Bengal
Tigers (RBTs). 

Enquiries revealed that soon after information
came about the elephant deaths, forest officials ran to the spot and
cut the tusks of one. This was done ostensibly to create an impression
that the elephants were females and that they might have died either
naturally or after taking poison normally used in agricultural fields

A
veterinary surgeon taken to the spot for post-mortem, however, blew the
lid. He did one autopsy, but was furious seeing the other with the
tusks taken away. He questioned the action of the forest officials and
returned without conducting the post-mortem, sources said.
