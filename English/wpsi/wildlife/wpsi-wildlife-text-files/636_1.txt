Difficult to save tigers without protecting habitats

CHENNAI:
An apex-level consultation involving Forest officials, scientists,
wildlife experts and the corporate sector will be held in New Delhi in
July to formalise the recommendations of the four national-level
consultations on the future of the Bengal Tiger, Bittu Sahgal, Editor,
Sanctuary Asia, said on Tuesday.

A final set of recommendations
would be prepared and submitted to the Prime Minister. Plans were also
afoot to hold a public rally stressing the need for protecting the
tiger.

“We will force the agenda on the political system.”
Sharing some of the important outcomes of the two-day consultation here
with journalists, Mr. Sahgal said it would be difficult to save tigers
without protecting habitats.

With the systematic melting of the
Himalayan Glaciers, the water source for the food basket States such as
Uttar Pradesh (western part), Punjab and Haryana would be affected.
This would force farmers and others to move south. Similar was the
condition in the neighbouring Bangladesh, where the people were exposed
to the dangers of submergence, he pointed out.

One of the
participants, Ritwick Dutta, an advocate, explained how to proceed
legally against anti-forest activities. Belinda Wright, a
conservationist, shared her knowledge of how poachers operate and
explained the routes through which wildlife trophies were smuggled out.

Countering
wildlife trade at the international and local levels, securing and
expanding the critical habitat network, village resettlement, using
science to guide park management, restoration of natural habitats and
financing the restoration of natural habitats were some of the key
recommendations made during the consultations.news source
