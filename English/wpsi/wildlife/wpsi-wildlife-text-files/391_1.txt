COP26: India PM Narendra Modi pledges net zero by 2070

 

2 Nov 2021

India has
promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070 - missing a key goal
of the COP26 summit for countries to commit to reach that target by
2050.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the pledge, the first time India has set a net zero target, at the Glasgow summit.

Net zero, or becoming carbon neutral, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

China has announced plans for carbon neutrality by 2060, while the US and EU aim to hit net zero by 2050.

The Indian leader is one of more than 120 leaders to have gathered in Glasgow for the two-week conference.

Dozens
gave speeches on Monday laying out goals to tackle the climate crisis,
including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and
UN Secretary General António Guterres.
