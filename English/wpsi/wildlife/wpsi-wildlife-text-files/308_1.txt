A wild, wild road

When
Bilal Habib, a scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII),
Dehradun, fixed camera traps on the pillars of nine underpasses beneath
a stretch of National Highway 44 — India’s longest highway from
Srinagar to Kanyakumari — he found, amid hundreds of images of people,
cattle and street dogs, a world of wildlife far vaster than he expected.

Two
days after the cameras were installed in March this year, a female
tiger was photographed strolling through one of these underpasses.
Within the next three months, a pack of wild dogs was filmed hunting a
spotted deer; then there was a leopard, a gaur, a sloth bear, civet
cats, and thousands of langurs. They used the underpasses mostly at
night but sometimes also by day; some in garrulous groups, others
solitarily; they used them to nap, to play among their pack, to hunt,
but most often, just to get to the forest on the other side of the road.
