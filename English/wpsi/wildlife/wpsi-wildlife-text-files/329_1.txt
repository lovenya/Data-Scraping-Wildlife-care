On
the eve of the ninth World Pangolin Day, the Madhya Pradesh forest
department announced the first-ever successful radio-tagging of the
Indian pangolin. Two rescued animals were radio-tagged and released in
the Satpura tiger reserve six months ago.

“This is the first
case of successful rehabilitation of the species where the released
individuals are monitored in the wild using telemetry,” said S K Singh,
chief conservator of forests and field director of Satpura Tiger
Reserve.

The exercise was part of a joint project initiated by
the Madhya Pradesh forest department and NGO Wildlife Conservation
Trust (WCT) to understand the ecology of the Indian Pangolin and
develop an effective conservation plan. The fieldwork is supported by
the YES Bank under its CSR initiative.
