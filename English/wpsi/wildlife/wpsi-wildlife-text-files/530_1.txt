16 August 2005

                        

One tiger skin was seized by the Maharashtra Forest Department on 8 August 2005 at Nagpur. Two people were arrested.

                        

The accused, who are residents of the neighbouring state of
Chhattisgarh, revealed during interrogation that their associates in
Chhattisgarh had some more skins.

                        

A trap was set for the remaining gang members by arranging a meeting in
Chhattisgarh. A team of enforcement personnel led by the Divisional
Forest Officer (Vigilance) of Nagpur, and assisted by the Wildlife
Protection Society of India (WPSI), went to the meeting place.

                        

Two gang members turned up, and were arrested, but no further recovery
was made. The Forest Departments of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra are
investigating the case..
