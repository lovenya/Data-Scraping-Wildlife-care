LUCKNOW:
Uttarakhand is turning into a virtual killing field for leopards. Out
of 136 registered cases of leopard poaching in 2011 so far, 51 have
been reported from the hill state. The Uttarakhand police in two
separate incidents has seized three leopard skins in the past 10 days.

A
leopard skin was seized and two persons arrested by the Uttarakhand STF
in Dehradun on Thursday. Two leopard skins, gall bladder of a Himalayan
black bear, musk pod of a musk deer, and other items were seized by the
SOG, Uttarakhand in Sukhi Dhang, Uttarkashi. One person has been
arrested in this connection so far.

The crackdown was carried in
collaboration with the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), the
agency which is assisting the forest departments of various states in
controlling wildlife crime. On September 21, three poachers were
arrested and a leopard skin was recovered from their possession in
Rishikesh.

Last year, 180 leopards were poached across the
country. The Union ministry of environment and forest, in one of the
estimates released in 2008, said, "There are not more than 11,000
leopards left in the country." The figures are alarming against the
backdrop that a leopard is listed under Schedule (I) of Wildlife
(Protection) Act and is identified as critically endangered. But, so
far its conservation has failed to garner as much attention as that of
a tiger or a lion.
