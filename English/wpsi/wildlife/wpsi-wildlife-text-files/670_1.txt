Centre
preparing web-based database to aid tiger conservation


PTI, 24th August 2009

NEW
DELHI: As part of efforts to counter threats to tiger population,
Centre is preparing the first web-based database on the endangered
species to facilitate information exchange among governments and
agencies on illegal wildlife trade and the conservation plan in the
country.

Modelled after the EU TWIX, presently being used by
over 431 wildlife law enforcement officials across 31 European
countries and 93 enforcement agencies, including Interpol, 'Tigernet'
will be an exclusive tool to share information among the states on
various aspect of tiger population ranging from illegal trade to their
breeding.

"We cannot sit idle given the dwindling population of
the royal tigers in the country. The comprehensive database on tiger
and related wildlife trade and crime is being prepared by World Wild
Fund (WWF) on behalf of the NTCA to support effective conservation
enforcement," Samir Sinha, head of Traffic India, a well-known wildlife
monitoring network associated with WWF said.

The database also
aims at capacity building as well development of training materials on
tiger conservation and intelligence development for various agencies
keeping in mind the poaching threat faced by the 1,400 tigers left in
various reserves in the country.

EU-TWIX is a short form for
EU-Trade in Wildlife Information exchange which was established by the
Belgian police, Customs and Cites, and Traffic Europe in 2005 and has
been found extremely useful in keeping tab on wildlife crime.

"The
Chief wildlife wardens and wildlife officials besides environment
ministry officials can access the database on the tiger status in the
reserves in any part of the state in the country," the wildlife expert
said, adding though public is restricted from availing the facility
they can suggest and give inputs.

It is likely to be launched by
the end of this month.newslink
