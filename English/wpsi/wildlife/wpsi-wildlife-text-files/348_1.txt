Plastic
waste associated with relief material, used in the aftermath of Cyclone
Amphan in the Sundarbans, could cause damage to the eco-sensitive
region, say environmentalists.

In June, following the Cyclone
Amphan, one of the worst cyclones to hit the east coast, the West
Bengal state government along with non-profits and volunteers were busy
with relief activities in the Sundarbans region. Thousands of tons of
dry ration kits loaded in four-wheelers and boats were supplied in the
worst hit areas of Sundarbans along with community kitchen set-up to
offer meals to the locals, many of whom had lost everything.

Environmentalists
fear that the delivery of dry ration kits in polythene bags and water
pouches, which, when discarded irresponsibly could be harmful to the
fragile Sundarbans.
