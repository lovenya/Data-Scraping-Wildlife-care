WPSI workshop for CBI 
                        
                        1st May, 2003
                        WPSI organised a one-day 
                          law enforcement workshop for members of the Central 
                          Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on 28 April 2003 in Delhi. 
                          Thirty members 
                          of the CBI attended the workshop, which was designed 
                          to collectively overview poaching, illegal wildlife 
                          trade, and wildlife protection laws in India. Although 
                          much of the time was taken up examining the recent Amendment 
                          to The Wild Life (Protection) Act, recurring difficulties 
                          in investigation procedures provided much opportunity 
                          for discussion. Avoiding technical errors, at the time 
                          of filing complaints with the courts, which provide 
                          loopholes for the defence to exploit, was another area 
                          of intense discussion during the legal session. A joint 
                          statement will shortly be released with recommendations 
                          to the government. 
                        Wildlife crime has 
                          clearly been on the increase throughout India and it 
                          has become increasingly important that the investigation 
                          and legal handling of such cases is strengthened. The 
                          CBI being the top most investigation authority in the 
                          country, is an important part of the efforts presently 
                          underway to curb wildlife crime. The Agency has been 
                          entrusted with some of the most important wildlife cases 
                          in recent times. The CBI has consistently endeavoured 
                          to live up to the task and their enthusiasm at the workshop 
                          and their willingness to take the issue further stands 
                          testimony to their commitment to curb illegal wildlife 
                          trade in India.
