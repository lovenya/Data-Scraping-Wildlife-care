Death of Gajaraj

 

18th Nov. 2018



For a week now, farmers in Kamalanga village of Odisha’s Dhenkanal
district have been visiting a fallow patch of land to offer prayers to
ensure that they are kept “safe from misfortune”.The patch, recently
dug and refilled, makes for a strange prayer spot. Over the loose soil,
fetid odours hang, mixing with the smell of foul water seeping up and
drawing frenzied flies. Fifty-year-old Bhima Bhoi tiptoes to the edge
of the spot, his head bowed in prayer. He ignores the acres of green
surrounding the place, where the grass smells sweet and wildflowers
wave in the breeze. He hisses angrily at a curious boy, who saunters
over.

Prayer over, he mumbles an ominous prediction. “When gajaraj (elephant) dies during the Gajalakshmi Puja, end is near.”

It
was here, on this patch of land, that seven elephants died due to
electrocution on October 26, after coming in contact with a low-hanging
11 KV power line. The seven deaths in one incident was Odisha’s worst
pachyderm tragedy through electrocution.
