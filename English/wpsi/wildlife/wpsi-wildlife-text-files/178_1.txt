Legal
reform was one of the most prominent commitments made by the current
government in 2014. Besides laws on energy and finance, a specific area
targeted for change is the dense legal framework of Acts, regulations,
notifications and guidelines that govern environmental approvals to

While evidence-based reform that draws on the experience and outcomes
of decades-old environmental regulation is welcome, this government has
given enough proof of turning this process into a narrow opportunistic
exercise. It seeks to gain political benefits by stretching law to
accommodate the government’s growth plan. It is no surprise, therefore,
that the courts are having to reinstate legal standards by holding off
these changes proposed by the government.
