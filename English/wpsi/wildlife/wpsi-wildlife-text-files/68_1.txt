India's shame - leopard burnt to death

 



On Wednesday, 23 March 2011, a
leopard mauled three people from Dhamdhar village in Adnala Range of
Kalagarh Forest Division, Corbett Tiger Reserve in the state of
Uttarakhand. The leopard was soon trapped inside a cattle shed in which
it had taken shelter. The Forest Department team arrived and 
tranquilised the leopard, after which it was put into a cage. But the
moment they started to transport the cage to the nearest range office
at Rathuwadhab, the forest staff were surrounded by a mob of about 400
angry villagers who seized the cage and started attacking the caged
leopard using iron rods, sickles and stones. The mob then doused the
caged leopard with kerosene and burnt it alive in the presence of
helpless forest and police officials. A postmortem revealed that the
leopard was not a man-eater. 

Ten people, including two women,
have been booked for the crime under the the IPC and the Wild Life
(Protection) Act. Two people were arrested from Dhamdhar village on 25
March, while the other accused are absconding.
