MoEF Order Is Capable Of Destroying National Parks And Wildlife Sanctuaries In The country: SC


 
18th Sept., 2017

In
a special leave petition filed against an order of the Bombay High
Court, the Supreme Court has observed that an order passed by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests was capable of destroying national
parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the country.

“It is extremely
surprising that 10 km. Eco Sensitive Zone has been reduced by the
Ministry of Environment and Forest to 100 meters. Since an order of
this nature is capable of destroying national parks and wildlife
sanctuaries in the country, we would like to examine the validity of
this reduction. Prima facie, it appears to us a complete arbitrary
exercise of powers by the Ministry of Environment and Forest.”

This
observation was made by the bench of Justice Madan B. Lokur and Justice
Deepak Gupta as the MoEF had granted environmental clearance to
companies located within the eco-sensitive zone (within 10 km) from the
Dadar Nagar Haveli Wildlife Sanctuary.
