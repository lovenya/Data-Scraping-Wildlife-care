Experts pan Wildlife Institute of India plan that could pave way for Arunachal dam project

 A
group of experts has panned a ‘flawed’ conservation plan by the
Wildlife Institute of India (WII) that could pave the way for a mega
hydroelectric project in an ecologically fragile part of Arunachal
Pradesh.

The flaws, they said, include overlooking several
endemic species of flora and fauna, reporting animals not found in
Asia, transporting butterflies from elsewhere in India and ignoring the
WII’s own report on the existence of the Royal Bengal tiger in Dibang
Valley district of Arunachal Pradesh.

The Forest Advisory
Committee (FAC) of the Environment Ministry on April 23 accepted the
WII Wildlife Conservation Plan for the impact zone of the 3097 MW
Etalin Hydroelectric Project “in toto”.
