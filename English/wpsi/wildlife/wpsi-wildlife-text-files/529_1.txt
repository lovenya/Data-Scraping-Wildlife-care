The accused is a bangle seller and has a shop in Bhavnagar, Gujarat. It is 
believed that the ivory was destined for this shop, after being crafted 
into bangles. According to the accused, he had bought the ivory from an 
elephant owner in east Delhi, who had himself obtained it through illegal 
means. Investigations are on, and leads from this case are being followed.
