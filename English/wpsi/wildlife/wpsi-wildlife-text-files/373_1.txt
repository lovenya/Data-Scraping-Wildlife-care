SC for converting overhead power cables to save Great Indian Bustard 

 

19 April 2021


The
Supreme Court on Monday directed Gujarat and Rajasthan governments and
others to consider converting the overhead cables into underground
powerlines to save the Great Indian Bustard.

One of the heaviest
flying birds was on the verge of extinction due to death caused
primarily by collision with overhead powerlines.

A bench of
Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian
directed that in all cases where the overhead powerlines existed in the
potential area of the bird, steps should be taken forthwith to install
diverters.

"Keeping in view the sustainable development concept
and on striking a balance, the protection of the rare species of birds
is essentially to be made. The effort is being to save every bird while
at the same time allowing transmission of power in an appropriate
manner," the bench said.

Acting on a PIL by noted wildlife
expert M K Ranjitsinh and others, the court said in addition to the
death of the birds due to collision and electrocution, the conservation
strategy also required protecting the eggs of the species of birds.

"For
conservation, the habitat restoration and for making it predator proof,
appropriate fencing is to be provided to the breeding grounds," the
bench said.
