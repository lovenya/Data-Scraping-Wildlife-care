The Madras High Court has directed the Nilgiris District Forest Officer
S Ramasubramanian and Collector Archana Patnaik to appear in court for
their alleged disobedience of the orders passed by it earlier.

A
division bench comprising Justices Elipe Dharma Rao and M Venugopal
gave the direction on Monday, while taking on file a contempt
application from S Jayachandran of Finger Post in Udhagamandalam,
seeking to punish the duo for their wilful disobedience of the court
orders. The duo were to appear before the judges on June 4.

According
to advocate M Santhanaraman, counsel for petitioner, who is also
honorary secretary of Nilgiris Wildlife and Environment Association,
writ petitions were filed challenging the validity of a GO dated August
31, 2010. By an order dated April 17 last year, a division bench of the
HC had upheld its validity relating to acquisition of land for an
elephant corridor.
