Tiger Skin Seizure 
                        on Indo-Nepal Border 
                        
                        10th August, 2004
                        One tiger skin was 
                          seized by the Uttaranchal Forest Department in Banbasa, 
                          a remote town near the Indo-Nepal border, on 10 August 
                          2004.
                        Acting on information provided by the Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI), officials of the Champawat 
                          Forest Division, led by the DFO Mr. Vidyasagar, seized 
                          the skin and arrested one Totha Ram. 
                        WPSI had been receiving field information that Totha 
                          Ram was stockpiling tiger and leopard skins for sale 
                          to Nepalese buyers. Once the location of the skins was 
                          confirmed, WPSI immediately coordinated a raid with 
                          the Forest Department, who recovered the tiger skin 
                          at 5 a.m. on 10 August 2004. At the time of writing, 
                          the team is still searching for the leopard skins. 
                        Banbasa, in Champawat District, has figured in several 
                          other wildlife offences recorded in WPSIâ€™s Database. 
                          It is only one and a half hours away by road from Mahendranagar, 
                          a major business and trade centre in Nepal. In the last 
                          month alone, reported seizures from Nepal amount to 
                          4 tiger skins, 8 leopard skins, 4 sacks of fresh tiger 
                          bones, 6 rhino horns and 1 sack of rhino bones and skins.
