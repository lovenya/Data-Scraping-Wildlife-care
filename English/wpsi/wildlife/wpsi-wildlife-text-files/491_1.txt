Tusker Killed in Kerala

                         
                        
                        3rd August, 2004
                        A tusker was shot 
                          dead and its tusks removed by poachers, in Kerala, on 
                          30 July 2004. Reports received by the Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI) indicate that on the night of 
                          30 July 2004, local tribal people in the Kuttampuzha 
                          Range of Malayatoor Forest Division heard the sound 
                          of a bullet being fired, followed by the screaming of 
                          an elephant. They then informed the Forest Department. 
                        
                        On reaching the site, Forest officials found the trunk 
                          of the tusker detached from the body and flesh removed 
                          from its thighs. There were also remnants of a tent 
                          and arrangements made for drying flesh in the area. 
                          So far, nobody has been suspected or arrested in this 
                          case. 
                        It is shocking that poaching continues in one of the 
                          prime habitats of the Asian elephant. The Illegal trade 
                          in ivory has been the major factor for the decline in 
                          the Asian elephant population in India. WPSI has records 
                          of 206 elephants killed in India during the period of 
                          2000-2003.
