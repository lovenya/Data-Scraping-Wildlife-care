23 Feb 2020



On
Thursday, a committee adopted India’s proposals for including three
species — great Indian bustard, Asian elephant and Bengal florican —
for additional protection under the UN Convention on the Conservation
of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). This happened at the 13th
Conference of the Parties to the CMS (CMS COP13), which is under way in
Gandhinagar, with “Migratory species connect the planet and together we
welcome them home” as its theme.
What does the Convention seek to do?

CMS
is a treaty agreed by 129 countries plus the European Union, and
functions under the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). It works for
protection and conservation of species that migrate across frontiers
and are facing threats of extinction or require urgent attention. CMS
aims to bring together different countries that are part of range of a
given species, and facilitate coherent conservation and protection
regimes in a group of countries. The conference is being held in India
for the first time. Delegates from at least 78 countries are attending.
