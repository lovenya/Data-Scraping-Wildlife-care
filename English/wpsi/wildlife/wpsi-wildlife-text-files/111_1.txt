NEW
DELHI: A high-level environment ministry panel has asked the state
governments not to grant permission for dolphinariums after animal
rights organizations voiced concern about the welfare of wild species
to be held captive in such proposed private facilities. 

The
Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), the statutory body under the
environment ministry, also asked the chief wildlife wardens of states
to withhold permission to any persons, government or private players
that proposes to import any Cetacean species for commercial exhibition
or research purposes. 

Dolphinariums are commercial captive
facilities that house wild dolphins that have been captured "through
cruel methods like drive captures", says FIAPO, an animal rights
organization. 

Recently proposals for dolphinariums had come up
in Kochi, Sindhudurg and Noida and the animal rights organizations
including FIAPO had presented comprehensive evidence based on
scientific research on issues involved in keeping dolphins captive.
