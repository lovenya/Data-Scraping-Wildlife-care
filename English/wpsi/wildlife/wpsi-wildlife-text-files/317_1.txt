Close
to 1,500 migratory birds died under mysterious circumstances around
Sambhar Lake in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, PTI reported on Monday.
Local residents claimed the number of dead birds could be as high as
5,000.

“The birds belong to roughly 15 species,” said Jaipur
Chief Conservator of Forests Arun Prasad, according to The Indian
Express. “It has been happening for the last three to four days.”

Officials
are yet to ascertain the cause of the deaths but suspect that the
reason was a hailstorm that hit the area a few days ago. They are
awaiting the viscera test reports. “We are also looking at other
possibilities like toxicity of the water, bacterial or viral
infection,” forest ranger Rajendra Jakhar told PTI.
