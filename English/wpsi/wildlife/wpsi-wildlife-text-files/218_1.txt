Elephants have first right on forest, says SC while ordering demolition of Numaligarh Refinery wall

 

20th Jan., 2019

A
two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on January 18 ordered public
sector undertaking Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) to demolish whatever
is left of a controversial 2.2-kilometre boundary wall topped with
barbed wire that lies in the middle of an elephant corridor in the
proposed Deopahar Reserve Forest, barely a few kilometres from the
Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve in Assam's Golaghat district.

The
bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah was listening to the
appeal of NRL against the order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT)
dated August 3, 2018, in which the tribunal had refused to review its
order of demolition passed in the year 2016. 

"Elephants have
the first right on the forest. Elephants do not go to office in a
designated route. We cannot encroach upon the elephant’s area," Justice
Chandrachud observed after NRL told the court that it had demolished
about 1 hectare (a 289 metre stretch) of the wall on March 13, 2018 and
there was no need to demolish the entire wall as it was not a part of
the Deopahar Reserve Forest.

NRL had built the wall in 2011, for
its housing estate. The township also boasts of a golf course among
other things. But it lies in the path of an elephant corridor. In May
2015, a male elephant died of haemorrhage after bashing its head
against the wall in an effort to break it. Videos have also captured
elephant herds trying to frantically make sense of how to go past the
barrier before dejectedly turning back.
