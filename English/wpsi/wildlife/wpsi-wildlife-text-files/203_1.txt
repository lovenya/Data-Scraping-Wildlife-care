UN report on global warming carries life-or-death warning 

 

8th Oct., 2018



“Limiting global warming to 1.5ºCelcius would require rapid,
far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society," the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a new
assessment made public on Monday.

The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC was approved by the IPCC on Saturday in Incheon, South Korea.

It
will be a key scientific input into the Katowice Climate Change
Conference in Poland in December, when governments review the Paris
Agreement to tackle climate change.  As many as 91 authors and
review editors from 40 countries, including from India, prepared the
IPCC report in response to an invitation from the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) when it adopted the
Paris Agreement in 2015.

“With more than 6,000 scientific
references cited and the dedicated contribution of thousands of expert
and government reviewers worldwide, this important report testifies to
the breadth and policy relevance of the IPCC,” said Hoesung Lee, Chair
of the IPCC in a statement.
