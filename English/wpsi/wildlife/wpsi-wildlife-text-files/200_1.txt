Declare all mangrove lands in state as reserved forests: Bombay HC

 

18th Sep., 2018



Mangrove protection in Maharashtra got a boost on Monday as the
Bombay high court (HC) said all mangroves in the state are to be
declared as protected or reserved forests, including those on land
belonging to planning authorities like the City and Industrial
Development Corporation (Cidco) and Mumbai Metropolitan Regional
Development Authority (MMRDA). 

According to Monday’s judgment,
mangroves across the state must be mapped every six months using
satellites and all mangroves in Maharashtra will be identified as
coastal regulation zone-I, including the 50-metre buffer zone for areas
with more than 1,000 sq metres of mangroves. Destruction of mangroves
and dumping of debris remains prohibited in these areas. 

If
mangroves are cut or destroyed, the state government must take action
under section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. Restoration
activities have to be carried out immediately after action has been
taken.

The court was hearing petitions filed to curb the
destruction of mangroves. One of them was filed in 2004 by Debi Goenka,
executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust, then known as Bombay
Environment Action Group.
