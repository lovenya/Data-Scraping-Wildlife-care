Tiger Skin Found in New Jalpiguri





11 July 2006

                        

One full grown tiger skin and 15 tiger claws were found in an unclaimed
parcel in New Jalpaiguri railway station on 7 July 2006. Railway Police
sources claimed that the parcel had been lying unclaimed in the parcel
room for two years.

                        

The skin, which was around 8 feet long, has been handed over to the
Divisional Forest Officer of Wildlife 1 Division, Darjeeling. No
arrests have been made so far.

                        

The parcel, which came from Kolkata, had no delivery address.
Meanwhile, sources are speculating that railway parcel office employees
may have been involved, since the parcel managed to reach New
Jalpaiguri from Kolkata without any address.
