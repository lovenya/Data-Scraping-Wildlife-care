Gir lions death issue: Amicus Curiae Hemang Shah submits suggestion brief in the High Court

 

20 June 2019



Ahmedabad:
The amicus curiae of the Gujarat high court in the matter of lions
deaths in and around Gir Sanctuary in Gujarat, Hemang Shah in his brief
given to the court has given several suggestions.

The court had sought suggestions on preventing lions deaths during hearing of this matter in January this year.

The
court was hearing the matter after the death of three young lions in
Savarkundala area getting run over by a goods train in December last
year.

An amicus curiae (literally, “friend of the court”;
plural, amici curiae) is someone who is not a party to a case and may
or may not have been solicited by a party and who assists a court by
offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the
issues in the case; and is typically presented in the form of a brief.
The decision on whether to consider an amicus brief lies within the
discretion of the court.

In his brief Shah has reportedly
included nine points including those related to lack of radio collaring
and GPS tracking of lions, lack of natural hunt for them, issues
related to railway tracks passing through the jungle, open wells in
areas around the forest, electric fencing, illegal mining, illegal
lions shows and said dearth of lion trackers.
