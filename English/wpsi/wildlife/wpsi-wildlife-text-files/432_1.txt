Sustainable fishing sorely needed to save sharks off India’s coastline

 

6 April 2023The continued demand for them has led to a steep fall in shark landings over the last three decades.

The
sky is still a silvery-blue as the sun’s rays penetrate through a
low-hanging haze. In the coastal town of Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh,
against the backdrop of the shimmering sea, yellow boats bob up and
down impatiently as if waiting to be let loose. Behind a line of
chemical fertilizer and edible oil industries a narrow lane leads up to
the Kumbabhishekam fish landing centre.

with a temple at its edge fills up in minutes when the morning haul is
brought in. There are small trucks, big trucks, fisherwomen sitting in
neat rows with wicker baskets, and a few hundred people milling around.
