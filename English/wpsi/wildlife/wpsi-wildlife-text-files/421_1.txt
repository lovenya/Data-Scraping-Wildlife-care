Champhai district in Mizoram is now a hotspot for wildlife trafficking in India

 

15 Sept 2022Early
morning on May 25, a Tata Sumo ‘maxi cab’ – an SUV commonly used for
long distance travel across Mizoram – was stopped at the Khankawn
police check gate in Champhai district. Suspicious to find the taxi
empty given that passengers generally onboard at Champhai town, the
cops interrogated the driver. According to the driver, the cab had been
hired at Champhai by passengers who were supposed to board mid-route.
Following the lead from the taxi driver, the police succeeded in
intercepting one of the biggest consignments of live exotic animals
seized in northeast India.

The seizure took place at Chalbawiha
Junction near the check gate. Cops arrested Gospel Chanchintha, from
Hmunlai in the Lawngtlai district, and his four accomplices from
Zokhawthar in Champhai.
