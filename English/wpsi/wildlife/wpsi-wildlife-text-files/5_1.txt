                        20 April 2007

 

One leopard skin and a number of other wildlife items were seized by
the Uttarakhand Forest Department in Rishikesh today. Two men and a
woman were arrested.

 

Assisted by the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), the
raiding party searched a house in the Khanjar Basti area of Rishikesh
and found 1 fresh leopard skin, 4 live pythons, 1 live cobra, 1 eagle
leg with the talons attached, 2 civet or langur skulls, 1 complete
snake skeleton, a piece of an antler and 8 fake musk pods.

 

Four steel traps used for big cats and other poaching tools were also
seized, along with a mobile phone and two Voter Identity Cards.
Interestingly, the names of the accused on the cards do not match those
they gave to the Forest Department.

 

The accused are now being interrogated and further leads are being developed.
