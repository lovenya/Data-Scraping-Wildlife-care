Some say we must “sell the tiger to save it.”  In
fact, if there is selling and buying, wild tigers will die. 
Selling the parts and products of tigers will accelerate the steep
decline of Asia’s remaining wild tiger populations.   

 

Tiger trade is prohibited internationally and also is banned
domestically in many countries, including China historically the
largest market for tiger products.  These bans have successfully
shut down legal tiger trade and nearly extinguished demand.  They
must be reinforced, not undermined.  Even limited legalization
would rekindle demand and confuse consumers and law enforcement
agencies alike about which products are legal and which are
not.   

 

It is critical to know the facts and fallacies surrounding proposals to
farm tigers and sell their parts and products, such as tiger bone
wine.   

 

To save tigers, we must not sell them.  There are simply too few
wild tigers left to risk reopening trade of any kind.
