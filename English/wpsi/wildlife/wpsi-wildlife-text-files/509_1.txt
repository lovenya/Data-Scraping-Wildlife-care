                        Trader Sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment 
                        
                        28th Dec., 2004
                         Notorious wildlife 
                          trader Lala Qureshi, and poacher Lallan Pardi were sentenced 
                          to three years Rigorous Imprisonment and fined Rs. 10,000 
                          each by the Judicial Magistrate of Katni, Madhya Pradesh. 
                          

                          

                          The two were the prime accused in the Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI) assisted seizure of 7 leopard 
                          skins from Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh, on 23 June 2004. 
                          The other three accused were acquitted due to lack of 
                          concrete evidence against them. 

                          

                          Qureshi, a resident of Shahdol, is believed to be an 
                          important supplier of Shabbir Hasan, the main accused 
                          in the horrific Khaga case of January 2000 where 70 
                          leopard skins, 18,000 leopard claws, 4 tiger skins and 
                          221 otter skins were seized. 

                          

                          WPSI investigators and lawyers have been working closely 
                          with the Forest Department and prosecution officers 
                          to secure this conviction. After the seizure in June 
                          2004, WPSI coordinated raids with enforcement personnel 
                          in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to try and get the 
                          big traders arrested. Information gathered from this 
                          case has thrown up links with wildlife crimes in several 
                          other states.
