D.C., USA: Tiger conservationists welcome the announcement Thursday
that the Bush Administration will work to oppose the lifting of
China’s domestic ban on tiger trade.

                        

The Administration told Congress yesterday that it would actively work
to keep China’s 14-year-old ban in place at next month’s
meeting of 171 nations at the Convention on the International Trade of
Endangered Species (CITES) came yesterday. Todd Willens, head of the
U.S. CITES delegation, testified in front of the House Subcommittee on
Natural Resources that the United States would work to persuade China
not to lift the ban. The Chinese government is expected to try to make
its case for resuming trade to the international community at CITES.

                        

“It is critical that the United States and other important
partners of China speak up for tigers at the CITES conference in
June,” said Judy Mills of the International Tiger Coalition.
“It is even more important that countries with wild tigers, such
as India, let China know how important its trade ban is for survival of
their tigers.”

                        

Wealthy, well-connected investors behind “tiger farms” in
China that breed tigers for profit are pressuring the Chinese
government to lift its successful ban on the trade of tiger parts.
These investors are stockpiling tiger carcasses in the hopes that they
can overturn the ban and rekindle demand for tiger bone medicine and
other products made from tigers, which have been in decline since the
1993 ban went into effect.

                        

The International Tiger Coalition is an alliance of 30 organizations
representing more that 100 organizations across the globe united under
the common aim of stopping trade in tiger parts and products from all
sources. Members include conservationists, animal welfare groups,
traditional Chinese medicine organizations and zoos.
