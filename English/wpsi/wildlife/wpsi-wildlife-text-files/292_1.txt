India to seek boost to protection status of 5 species at CITES 

 

9 Aug. 2019


India
has submitted proposals regarding changes to the listing of various
wildlife species in the CITES secretariat meeting, scheduled later this
month in Geneva, Switzerland.

CITES (Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species on Wild Fauna and Flora) is an
international treaty to ensure that trade in wild animals and plants do
not threaten their survival.

The proposals submitted are
regarding changes in the listing of the smooth-coated otter,
small-clawed otter, Indian star tortoise, Tokay gecko, wedgefish and
Indian rosewood.

The country seeks to boost the protection of all the five animal species as they are facing a high risk of international trade.

For
the Indian rosewood, the proposal is to remove the species from CITES
Appendix II. The species covered by CITES are listed in three
appendices on the degree of protection they require.
