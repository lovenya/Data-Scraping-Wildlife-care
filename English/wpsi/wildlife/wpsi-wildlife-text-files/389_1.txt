1 Oct 2021

As instances
of human-elephant conflict rise, the Ministry of Environment, Forests
and Climate Change has embarked on a massive project to identify and
secure elephant corridors in the country.

The corridors could also be notified in order to give legal protection to the movement of elephants.

According
to Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, the Ministry has “recently
initiated the verification exercise of elephant corridors and is also
working on mapping land use and land cover of elephant reserves in the
country using GIS technology which will also aid conservation”.

Experts
said elephant corridors have been changing over the years. Eighty-eight
corridors were identified jointly by the Ministry and Wildlife Trust of
India (WTI), and published in 2005.
