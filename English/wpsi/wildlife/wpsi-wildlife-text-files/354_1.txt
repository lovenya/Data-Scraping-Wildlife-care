Rhino poachers in North East have links with Manipur insurgents, police say

 

27 Aug 2020




On a full moon night in early May, poachers struck in Agratoli on the eastern side of India’s famed Kaziranga National Park.

Forest
guards found the carcass of a greater one-horned rhinoceros with its
horn missing on May 9, confirming it to be a case of poaching. Eight
automatic rifle bullets were recovered from the spot.

More than
two months after the incident and several arrests and an encounter
killing later, police say they have vital clues which suggest that
cadres of the Zomi Revolutionary Army, an insurgent group with a
presence in the Manipur state in the North East India and its border
with Myanmar, are a crucial cog in a transnational rhino horn smuggling
racket that extends to South East Asia and China via Myanmar.
