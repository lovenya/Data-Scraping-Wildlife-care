Leopard Poachers Convicted to Six Years Imprisonment
 

15 November 2010

Katni,
Madhya Pradesh: Shri A.A. Ansari, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Katni,
today sentenced two poachers, Ittu Baiga and Bahilal Baiga, to rigorous
imprisonment of six years and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each under the
Wildlife Protection Act 1972. On 25 June, 2009, the two poachers had
poisoned a water-hole in the Dhimarkheda range of Katni division with
an organo-phosphate pesticide (phosphamidan) which led to the death of
nine wild animals including three leopards, two civet cats, one spotted
deer and one langur monkey. Another poacher, Iqbal (alias Atiq Ahmed),
is still absconding in this case.
 
Poisoning of water-holes
is a terrible method of poaching which results in indiscriminate
killing of animals, irrespective of which species the poacher is after.
The case was initially tried a Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Katni,
Shri U.S. Agrawal, who convicted the accused and observed that the
gravity of the offence deserved more than three years punishment, which
is the maximum that he could award as per Section 29(2) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. Accordingly, on July 31, 2010, he commuted
the case to the Chief Judicial Magistrate to award the sentence. 
 
The
leopard is listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, and the
civet cat is listed in Part II of Schedule II of the Act. The penalty
for a first time offence involving these species is between three to
seven years of imprisonment and a fine not less than ten thousand
rupees. 

The prosecution of the case was handled by Advocate Ms
Manjula Shrivastava, who is also a lawyer for the Wildlife Protection
Society of India (WPSI) at Katni..
