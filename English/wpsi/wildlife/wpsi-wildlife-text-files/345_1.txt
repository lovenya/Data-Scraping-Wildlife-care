Despite the headlines, China’s Government still promotes pangolin scales in traditional medicines - EIA

 

23 June 2020



China
secured huge international media coverage when its
Government-controlled State media reported pangolin scales had been
removed as a raw ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) – but
in reality they can still be legally traded and used.

The story
that pangolin was dropped from the official TCM pharmacopoeia, a
compendium of approved traditional and Western medicines, was widely
interpreted as a ‘ban’ on pangolin scales.

But EIA has
discovered they’ve not been banned at all – behind the spin, pangolin
scales are still listed as an ingredient in patent medicine formulae
found in the official reference book.

Pangolins are the world’s
most trafficked mammal and have been identified as a possible
intermediate host in the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, although
this has yet to be conclusively proven.
