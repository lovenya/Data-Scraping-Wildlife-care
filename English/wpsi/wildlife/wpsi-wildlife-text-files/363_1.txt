3 Dec 2020


An expert
panel of India’s environment ministry has deferred environment
clearance for the Lower Orr Dam, which is part of the Ken-Betwa river
interlinking project, and sought fresh data to decide whether a new
public hearing is expected for the project or not.

Identified as
a national project, it is part of the Ken-Betwa river interlinking
project and envisages construction of a 45 metre high and 2,218-metre
long dam across Orr river near village Didauni in Madhya Pradesh to
provide irrigation facility to 90,000 hectares of area.

The
project’s estimated cost is about Rs 30.65 billion and requires 3,730
hectares of land, of which 968.24 hectares is forest land. It is
expected to submerge about 2,723.70 hectare area including seven fully
affected villages and five villages partially. It was considered for
clearance in the meeting of the expert appraisal committee (EAC) for
river valley and hydroelectric projects on October 29, 2020.
