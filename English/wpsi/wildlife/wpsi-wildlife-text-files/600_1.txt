                        One
tiger skin was seized by the Vigilance wing of Kerala Forest Department
on 8 September 2007, near Nedumbasseri, Malayatoor Division. Four
people were arrested in the operation carried out by Range Officer Mr.
Shanavas Khan.

                        

According to preliminary reports, the tiger had probably been killed
within the last two months. The skin has been roughly cured with salt,
and the pads are not yet dry. It is believed that one of the accused
had procured the skin from near the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border.

                        

All four accused are now in judicial custody. In the meanwhile, since
the seizure has thrown up connections between traders across three
states, the National Tiger Conservation Authority has requested that
the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation.
