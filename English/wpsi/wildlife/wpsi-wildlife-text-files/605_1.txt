A large male tiger in Kanha Tiger Reserve had a lucky escape yesterday
from a poacher's trap. Three iron jaw traps had apparently been set on
one of the major tracks through Kanha, near Chimpta Camp in Kisli
Range. A group of labourers, who had been sent into the jungle to
repair the road and cut the side grass ready for the season's tourist
traffic, apparently stumbled on the tiger caught in one of the traps.
As the people approached, the huge tiger managed to pull himself free
from the trap.

                        

It is reliably learnt that the same male tiger was shown to tourists
this morning from elephant-back near Chimpta Camp, in the so called
"tiger show". If this is indeed true, it is shocking that a traumatised
and injured tiger should be abused this way by the Park authorities.
Even if there is no visible injury, these vicious traps usually cause
significant tissue damage. It is also of concern that poachers should
blatantly set three iron traps on a road inside one of India's premier
Tiger Reserves. This is surely a serious indictment of what the tiger
poachers think of the Kanha management.

                        

A similar incident happened on 14th December last year when tourists
found a large male tiger in Kanha dragging an iron trap attached to one
of its legs. It is only thanks to the fact that the traps in both these
cases were of poor quality, that the two male tigers managed to survive.
