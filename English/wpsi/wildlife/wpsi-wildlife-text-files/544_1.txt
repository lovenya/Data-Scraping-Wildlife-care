Kerala Forest Department personnel seized two leopard skins and the
tushes of a female elephant on 27 December 2005 and arrested three
people. 

                        


Acting on a tip-off, forest officials raided a house near Periyar Tiger
Reserve, and recovered the skins of an adult leopard and a cub. They also
found the tushes of a female elephant, whose age was estimated to be
around 30 years. 

                        


It is believed that the poachers killed the animals in Periyar Tiger
Reserve. In July 2005 alone, three tiger skins and one leopard skin were
recovered in and around Periyar.
