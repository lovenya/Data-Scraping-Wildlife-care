In a first, the elusive clouded leopard sighted in Nagaland mountains

 

7 Jan 2022A
team of researchers have recorded photographic evidence of clouded
leopards at an elevation of 3,700 metres in a community-owned forest
along the Indo-Myanmar border in Nagaland — arguably one of the highest
reported altitudes where the animal has been sighted in the world till
date.

The findings have been published in the Winter 2021 issue
of the Cat News, the IUCN/Species Survival Commission (SSC) Cat
Specialist Group’s biannual newsletter.

The tree-climbing
clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), a medium-sized felid (wild cat),
is the smallest of the large wild cats and is categorised as
‘Vulnerable’ under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Since they
are largely known to inhabit low elevation evergreen rainforests, the
sighting is significant, experts said.
