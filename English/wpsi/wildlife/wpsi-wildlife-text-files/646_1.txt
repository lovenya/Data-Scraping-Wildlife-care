Ranthambhore & Sariska tiger poacher arrested



24 July 2009


Earlier
today, 24 July, 2009, a team comprising of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve
staff and a WPSI representative, acting on intelligence provided by
WPSI, arrested poachers Prahlad, Ram Singh, and Raju at Dumariya
village in Bharatpur District, Rajasthan. A country made,
muzzle-loading rifle was found in the possession of Raju. All three
poachers belong to the Mogiya community.

Prahlad is a notorious
tiger poacher who has been operating in Ranthambore and Sariska Tiger
Reserves for several years. He is believed to be an accomplice in two
tiger poaching incidents in Ranthambore, in 1992 and 2001. The April
2005 CBI report, “Disappearance of Tigers from Sariska”, also names
Prahlad as an accused in two tiger poaching incidents in 2002. Prahlad
has been absconding in all these cases and has not previously been
arrested.
