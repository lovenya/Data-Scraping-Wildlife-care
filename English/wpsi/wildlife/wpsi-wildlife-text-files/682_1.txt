Excerpt
from the visit of the Minister of Environment and Forests, Jairam
Ramesh, to the Express newspaper for an 'Idea Exchange':

NEHA
SINHA: You were recently in China to discuss cooperation on Himalayan
glaciers and on tiger conservation. You have said that our tigers are
being poached to fuel Chinese demand. How optimistic are you about the
two countries working together?
JAIRAM RAMESH: I had an interesting
discussion with the Chinese on tigers. I asked them to help us conserve
tigers and pointed out they were the largest market for tigers. They
said that the demand or shahtoosh in India is killing off the Tibetan
antelope and the antelope is to China what tigers are to India. I said
you can't compare the two; we don't have an Indian system of medicine
which uses antelope parts as they do with tigers. But if tigers re
being smuggled across the border, the responsibility is India's. We
can't blame the Chinese, If we take tough action against our poachers,
the message will go out. However, the Chinese can cooperate with us in
terms of policing and intelligence and, more importantly, in phasing
out the tiger farms which is a requirement under the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species. To their credit, the Chinese
have enforced a trade ban on tiger parts.
