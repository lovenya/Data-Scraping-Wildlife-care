Centre to rank states on faster green nods, fewer details sought

 

21 Jan 2022In
a controversial move, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and
Climate Change has decided to “incentivise states” by ranking them on
the basis of “efficiency and timelines in grant of environmental
clearances”.

The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority
(SEIAA) which clears projects in the shortest period of time, has a
high rate of clearance, and seeks fewer “essential details” will be
ranked the highest.

“It has been decided to incentivise the
states through a star-rating system, based on efficiency and timelines
in grant of EC (environmental clearance). This is intended as a mode of
recognition and encouragement as well as for prompting improvements
where needed,’’ the ministry said in an order issued on Monday.
