Green Energy, Red Tape & Last Stand Of The Great Indian Bustard


 
13th Jan., 2018

New
Delhi: On December 29, 2017, in a dry, desert near India’s western
frontier, forest officials found the dismembered carcass of a large
brown-and-white bird.

They quickly recognised it as one of the
world’s largest flying birds, one of its most endangered species, and
the bird most likely to be the first in the subcontinent to slide into
extinction in 21st century.

With its distinctive bare, powerful
legs, the dead great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps)–no more than
150 are believed to be alive worldwide, meaning in India and
Pakistan–was found electrocuted the previous evening in the village of
Khetloi near Rajasthan’s Desert National Park, which is twice the size
of Mumbai and is India’s second-largest national park. The bustard
lives on less than a third of the national park, where about 4% of park
land is controlled by the forest department.

Now extinct across
90% of its original subcontinental range, the last stand of the bustard
indicates the loss of the scrub land and grasslands where this
ground-dwelling bird makes its home. Its retreat also indicates growing
pressures on open land in India for mining, agriculture, grazing, power
lines and other infrastructure.
