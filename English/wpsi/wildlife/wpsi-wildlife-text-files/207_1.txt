China legalizes rhino horn and tiger bone for medical purposes

 

29th Oct., 2018



In China, rhino horn and tiger bone may now be legally used in
medical research or traditional medicine following a controversial
announcement by the government this morning. The animal specimens may
be obtained only from farms, according to the announcement, but
conservationists say this surprising move may open the floodgates for a
surge in illegal activity and threaten vulnerable animal populations.

The
move is “very concerning,” says Leigh Henry, director of wildlife
policy at the World Wildlife Fund. Discerning what animals were
obtained legally from farms rather than illegally from the wild would
be incredibly difficult, so this decision would give cover to
traffickers, she says. Rhinos and tigers are both endangered in the
wild, and their trade is prohibited. “WWF urgently calls on China to
maintain the ban on tiger bone and rhino horn trade which has been so
critical in conserving these iconic species. This should be expanded to
cover trade in all tiger parts and products,” she says.

China’s
action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat
poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in
place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World
Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that
dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino
horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on
patients (though the market still existed for them).
