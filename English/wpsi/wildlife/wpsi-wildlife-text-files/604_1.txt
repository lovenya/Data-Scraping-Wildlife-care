A tiger skin and bones were seized last night, 27 October 2007, from a
village in the Mailani Range of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, by forest
officials. Three poachers were arrested. Dudhwa has long been
vulnerable to poachers due to its location on the Indo-Nepal border;
wildlife criminals can commit a crime and simply vanish over the
border. The Range Officer of Mailani and the Field Director's team are
to be highly recommended for this successful enforcement operation.

                        

Â The earlier report of three tiger skins seized near Mumbai on 25
October by the Crime Police, turned out to be a false alarm. They were
painted dog skins. On the same day, there was another report from Son
Bhadra in Uttar Pradesh of a seizure of ten tiger skins. Fortunately
these also turned out to be fake skins.
