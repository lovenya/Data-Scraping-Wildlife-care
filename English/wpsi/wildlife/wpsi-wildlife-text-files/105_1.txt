Kaziranga’s worries: drowning and hit & run
 
Indian Express, Samudra Gupta Kashyap : Guwahati, Mon Jul 02 2012, 

Assam’s
worst flood in eight years has taken a heavy toll on the Kaziranga
National Park, inundating 80 per cent of its 800sq km area and exposing
its animals to highway traffic as they head for shelter in drier areas.

Two
adult rhinos and a calf, 22 hog deer and one elephant calf have died
due to the floods, while 17 hog deer have been run over while crossing
NH-37. “There has been extensive damage to roads and bridges inside the
park,” park director S K Bora said. Since Thursday, he said, the two
ageing rhinos and the calf have died because they could not negotiate
the swirling waters.

Flood waters had been trickling into the
park for a fortnight and the level rose sharply on June 26 due to rains
in the catchment areas in upper Assam, eastern Arunachal Pradesh and
Nagaland. The effort to protect the animals have left the park’s
900-plus frontline staff on their toes. Over 60 of the 152 watch-camps
inside the park are submerged, forcing the squads to patrol from boats.
