New Delhi India
is richly endowed with biodiversity and is home to a fascinating array
of wildlife, including major species like the tiger, lion, elephant and
rhinoceros. Our protected areas and other natural ecosystems offer a
wide range of tangible as well as intangible benefits.We
are guardians of this treasure and it is our responsibility to protect
it for posterity. This could be best achieved by harmonizing our
development imperatives with conservation concerns. It is neccessary
that all Indians recognize this and cooperate towards conserving our
irreplacable wildlife.Wildelife
week coincides with the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the postle
of non-violence. His ideal of non-violence towards all living beings
should guide us in understanding our relationship with wildlife. On
this occasion, let us reaffirm our commitment to conserving our
wildlife.
