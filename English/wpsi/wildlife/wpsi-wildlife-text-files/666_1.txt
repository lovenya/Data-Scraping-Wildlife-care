No
money for U'khand tiger conservation plan till it inks pact


PTI, 23rd August,2009

New
Delhi, Aug 23 (PTI) Uttarakhand Government's ambitious plan to acquire
microlight aircraft for Corbett Tiger Reserve will have to wait with
the Centre not ready to release funds to the state unless it signs a
tripartite pact on conservation of the endangered species.

"Unless
the state government signs a tripartite agreement with the us, no funds
will be released. In simple words, it would not be able to acquire
aircraft and motion sensors as demanded by it till then,"sources in
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) told PTI.

In June,
Union Forest Minister Jairam Ramesh had agreed to the state
government's Rs 8.5 crore comprehensive security plan spread over next
six years which included purchase of an aircraft.

The aircraft
was meant for air surveillance and for use during times of emergency in
the park which has a rough terrain, making foot monitoring extremely
difficult in its dense forests.

"We need easy connectivity and
mobility which such an aircraft can provide. Patrolling in Corbett
spread in the 1,000 square km area is not easy,"a senior official from
Corbett Tiger Reserve said.

He said the state government is in
the midst in finalising the nitty-gritty of the tripartite agreement to
be signed with the Centre which makes the NTCA, the state government
and tiger reserve's director accountable for the big cat conservation.

Corbett,
which houses the maximum tigers in the world between 160-200, is always
under threat from the poachers.newslink
