Tiger Parts Seized in Uttar Pradesh 

16th August 2005

                        

One tiger skin, 7 kg tiger bones and 18 teeth were seized by the Uttar
Pradesh Forest Department on 16 August 2005. Three people have been
arrested.

                        

Following a wildlife conservation awareness campaign run by the Forest
Department, villagers of Hallowali approached the Divisional Forest
Officer (DFO) of the Bijnore Plantation Division to say that they had
caught three suspicious-looking men carrying a reeking bundle near
their village. On reaching the spot, the DFO, Mr. Sunil Dubey,
recovered the tiger parts and arrested the three men.

                        

According to preliminary information gathered by the Wildlife
Protection Society of India, two of the accused are from Haryana while
the third is from West Bengal. They claimed that they had come across a
dead tiger near the jungle, and collected its parts for sale. However,
the skin – which is that of a full grown tiger –
contradicts their statement. It has trap marks on one of its paws.

                        

WPSI is assisting the Forest Department in this case. WPSI’s
records show that one of the accused has been arrested earlier for the
possession of a tiger trap in the neighbouring state of Uttaranchal.
The accused have been sent to jail by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of
Bijnore.
