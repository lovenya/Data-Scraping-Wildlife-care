Bengaluru:
India lost at least 218 leopards over the first four months of 2019,
more than 40% of the previous year’s death toll of 500, which itself
was the highest ever since the nonprofit Wildlife Protection Society of
India (WPSI) began keeping records in 2009.

died every day in India--trapped in wells, beaten or shot to death, run
over on rail and road--in 2018, according to WPSI data, a primary
