Seven Leopard Skins 
                        Seized in MP 
                        
                        29th June, 2004
                        Raids carried out 
                          by the Katni Forest Department on 23 June 2004 in Katni 
                          and Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh led to the seizure of 7 
                          leopard skins. The 
                          seizure is important not only because it involves large-scale 
                          trade in a Schedule I specie, but also because one of 
                          4 men arrested admitted that he supplied directly to 
                          Shabbir Hasan Kureshi. Kureshi is the main accused in 
                          the January 2000 Khaga case, in which 70 leopard skins, 
                          18,000 leopard claws, 4 tiger skins, 132 tiger claws 
                          and 221 otter skins were seized. 
                        New evidence of poaching activities in Madhya Pradesh, 
                          Maharashtra and Gujarat on a much larger scale than 
                          previously believed and evidence of the gang’s 
                          contact with Delhi and Uttar Pradesh has come up. The 
                          arrested trader also confessed that he has supplied 
                          “at least ten tigers in the past year”.
                        In the hours that followed the seizure, WPSI was able 
                          to coordinate with enforcement officers at various locations 
                          in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to help conduct 
                          raids and arrest the big traders. Investigations are 
                          underway and a warrant against Shabbir Hasan Kureshi 
                          has been issued.
