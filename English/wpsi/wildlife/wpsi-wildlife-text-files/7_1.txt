Film star Salman Khans appeal against a five-year sentence for poaching
was rejected by the District and Sessions Court in Jodhpur today. The
judge upheld the 2006 order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Jodhpur
who had sentenced Khan to five years and one year for two chinkara
poaching incidents. 

 

The judiciary has sent a clear message that poaching will not be
tolerated, and that no-one is above the law. This was an important
case, not only because it involved a famous actor but also the death of
an endangered species that is only found in India, said Belinda Wright,
Executive Director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India.

 

Members of the local Bishnoi community caught Khan hunting blackbuck
while he was in Jodhpur in October 1998 for a film shoot. WPSI was
requested to come immediately to Jodhpur to assist in the case, which
we did. We then helped the prosecution in the preparation of documents
for the case, and have been closely monitoring the proceedings ever
since. 

 

During the initial investigations of the blackbuck case, the Forest
Department discovered that Salman Khan had earlier killed chinkara as
well. Both these species are given the highest level protection under
Indias Wild Life (Protection) Act. Cases were then filed against Khan
in the local police station. Todays orders are on the chinkara case.
