A

Bolangir district on February 5, 2019. 

The leopard was stuck
in the iron trap unattended for hours together and in the struggle to
get out its left leg had been dismembered.

“The leopard had also
sustained deep wounds in other parts of its body while trying to escape
from the trap laid by poachers to catch wild boar,” said Rashmi Ranjan

have launched an operation against poachers. Also, an autopsy would be
conducted and we have registered a case under provisions of the
