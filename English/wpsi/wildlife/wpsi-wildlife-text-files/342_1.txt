Trade in Dolphin Oil and Body Parts in Central West Bengal

South
Asian River Dolphin, also known as Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista
Gangetica) is an endangered species found in Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
river systems in India and Bangladesh. It is listed as Endangered by
IUCN and protected as Schedule I species under the Wildlife
(Protection) Act, 1972. It is also the National Aquatic Animal of India
and the focus of a number of conservation projects.

Around
mid-2019, Human and Environment Alliance League (HEAL), a conservation
focused NGO in Kolkata, started receiving news of these dolphins being
killed in central West Bengal – particularly in the districts of
Murshidabad and Malda. The main motivation seemed to be the extraction
of oil, which is prized as very effective fish bait among the large
fishing communities settled along Ganges and Hooghly rivers in this
district.
