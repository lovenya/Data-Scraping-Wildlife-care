NAINITAL:
The picturesque Ramganga waterways, which was famously used by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi in February this year during his visit to the
Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), is again in the news as the CTR
administration is now proposing to open the Ramganga — which flows
through dense forests — for water tourism. In addition, there are also
plans to create a new zone in CTR, apart from the six that already
exist, in order to ease the pressure on the core area of the sanctuary
which sees increased tourist activity.

Speaking about the

operated throughout the year, except for three months of the monsoon.”
