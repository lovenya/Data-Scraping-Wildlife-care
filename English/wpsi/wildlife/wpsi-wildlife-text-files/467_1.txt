Delhi Bird-BNHS Bird 
                        Ringing Camp 
                        
                        20th September, 2003
                        The Delhi Bird-BNHS 
                          Bird Ringing Camp was organised in Basai in Haryana 
                          from 9 to 14 September 2003 with support from WPSI.
                        This was the third, 
                          and longest, bird-ringing camp held at Basai under the 
                          guidance of Dr Balachandran and with organisational 
                          support provided by delhibird. Approximately 300 people 
                          attended the camp. The new Checklist of the Birds of 
                          the Delhi Region was distributed. 
                          Three hundred and sixty one birds were ringed, of 34 
                          species. Of particular interest were two Baillon's Crakes 
                          (Oriental and Small Pratincoles), 130 Ruffs and 12 Bluethroats. 
                          There were fewer waders and ducks than last year because 
                          the excellent monsoon meant there were more alternative 
                          sites for them. The reduction in the typha beds meant 
                          there was no wagtail or hirundine roosts in the area 
                          and a number of other migrants appeared arriving late.
