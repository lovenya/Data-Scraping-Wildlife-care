One-km-long flyover to be built to facilitate elephant movement in Odisha 

 

1 Dec 2021

The National
Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will build a one-kilometre-long
flyover exclusively for elephant herds so that jumbos can cross the
busy highway unhindered beneath the structure in Odisha.

The
proposed flyover is the first of its kind structure to be created,
keeping the smooth movement of elephants in mind in the State.

“The
flyover for elephants will come up between Rairakhol and Sambalpur.
Vehicular traffic will move on the flyover while elephants will take
their traditional path underneath the structure,” said Ram Prasad
Panda, Chief General Manager, NHAI, Odisha on Tuesday.

At
present, when elephant herds are near the national highway-55 between
Cuttack and Sambalpur, the elephant tracker teams of the Forest and
Environment Department stop vehicular traffic from both sides.
