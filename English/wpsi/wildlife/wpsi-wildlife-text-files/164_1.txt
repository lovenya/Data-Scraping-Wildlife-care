BHOPAL:
MP wildlife board, ignoring strong protests from some members on
Tuesday cleared NDA governmentâ€™s ambitious Ken-Betwa rivers link
project. Scheduled to kick start from December this year, the project
is now being referred to national wildlife board for final clearance. 

River
link project will come up at Panna national park where the best of
tiger habitat is going to be submerged, something that is making
wildlife experts apprehensive. 

As chairman of the board, when
chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that board is clearing
the project, wildlife expert and former secretary of forest department
Ranjeet Singh protested. He said the decision was being forced upon the
board stating board is not a "project clearance" agency.

Sources
said chief minister reacted saying "If you are prejudiced with the
project and have come here with a pre- conceived notion then I cannot
help." 

Later talking to TOI, Singh said, "I am not prejudiced,
it seems chief minister came with a pre conceived notion to get the
project passed." 

"It is sad day for Panna tiger reserve",
Belinda Wright, a member of the board told TOI. "Independent members of
the board tried their best to protest, but we failed," she said. 

Singh
and Belinda registered their protests in writing and asked the
government to record it in the minutes the meeting that lasted for four
hours.
