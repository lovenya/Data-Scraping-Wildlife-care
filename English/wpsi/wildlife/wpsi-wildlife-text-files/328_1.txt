There
were no recorded evidence of Tiger-Cheetah conflicts, it said and
sought a view of lawyer assisting the court on relocation of the
animals.

A bench of Justices S A Bobde and B R Gavai wondered as
how the court would know whether the Cheetah would survive after senior
advocate Wasim Qadri, appearing for National Tiger Conservation
Authority (NTCA), said the sanctuary also has various animals like
Tiger and Leopard.

The top court, however, supported the move of
NTCA and said that it was not against the policy to experiment
relocating African Cheetah in Madhya Pradesh.
