A Himalayan black bear was killed for its gall bladder in Buxa Tiger
Reserve, West Bengal on 25 December 2005. The sub adult bear was poisoned
to death, and its gall bladder subsequently removed. 

                        


The Forest Department, which recovered the body, is searching nearby
villages that lie on the border with Bhutan and Assam. Buxa has a limited
black bear population, and the incident is a worrying reminder that the
bile trade is still active in North Bengal. 

                        


The Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) has received reports that
over the past month, six bear cubs have wandered out of Buxa and
subsequently rescued from nearby villages by the Forest Department. Some
local NGOâ€™s believe that the cubs may have been orphaned after their
mothers were killed for the bile trade.
