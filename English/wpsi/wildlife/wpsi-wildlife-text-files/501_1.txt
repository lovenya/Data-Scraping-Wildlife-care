                        Tiger Skin Seized in Chhattisgarh 
                        
                        1st Nov, 2004
                         A tiger skin was 
                          seized by the Forest Department on 28 October 2004 at 
                          the house of a village deputy headman in the Narayanpur 
                          area of the state of Chhattisgarh. This is the second 
                          tiger skin seizure from Chhattisgarh within a week. 
                        
                        Divisional Forest Officer, Mr. V.S. Lagra, arrested 
                          the deputy headman and a local poacher. Villagers had 
                          alerted the Forest Department after they noticed a tiger 
                          skin being dried on the deputy headmanâ€™s roof. 
                        
                        Initial reports received by the Wildlife Protection 
                          Society of India (WPSI) indicate that the 7 year old 
                          tiger had been poisoned. Only three days ago, a tiger 
                          skin was seized in Borgaon, Chhattisgarh, with WPSI 
                          assistance. On 12 February 2004, WPSI assisted in the 
                          seizure of a leopard skin in the Narayanpur area itself.
