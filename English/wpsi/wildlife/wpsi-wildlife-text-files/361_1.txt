Uttarakhand Proposes Denotification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve, Says it's Hindering Development Work

 

26 Nov 2020


Uttarakhand
wildlife board on Tuesday recommended denotification of 14 elephant
divisions in state which fall under the Shivalik Elephant Reserve.
Forest Minister Harak Singh Rawat said the move is aimed at paving way
for development activities and assured it "won’t affect" the movement
to protect elephants and their habitat.

Sources said the move
was particularly aimed at clearing hurdles coming in the way of
expanding Dehradun airport that is located on Dehradun-Rishikesh
Highway close to lush green Sal forest. The forest department has
already given a go ahead for axing the trees.

In 2002, the then
Congress government notified nearly 5,400 square kilometres of forest
land falling under 14 forest divisions as 'Shivalik Elephant Reserve'.
It comprises forest divisions of Dehradun, Haridwar, Pauri, Nainital
and Almora districts. Parts of Rajaji Tiger Reserve and Corbett Tiger
Reserve are also included in these critical forest divisions.
