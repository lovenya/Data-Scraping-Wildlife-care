Skin and Leopard Skin Seized in Kerala
                        
                        13th July
2005
                        A tiger
skin and a few tiger claws were seized by the Kerala Forest Department
in Periyar Tiger Reserve on 9 July 2005. The skin appears to be of a
full grown tiger.

                        

The Range Officer (RO) of Thekkady seized the skin and claws and
arrested two men. Two others managed to escape. Both the accused are
residents of Goodaloor, in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, just
across the state border from Periyar Tiger Reserve.

                        

The very next day, Mr. Prem Kumar, RO of Devi Kulam Range, Munnar,
seized one leopard skin and arrested two men. Interestingly, the skin
was wrapped up in a package and hidden in the branches of a tree near
the accused's house. Three other men wanted in the case are
absconding.
