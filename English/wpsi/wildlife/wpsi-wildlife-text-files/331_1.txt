Jharkhand wipes 3 wildlife sanctuaries off records for iron ore mining

 

3 March 2020



Areas
which should have been wildlife sanctuaries, teeming with animals and
birds, now lie hollowed out and turned into opencast iron ore mines in
Jharkhand.

This has happened at the hands of the state
government. In an elaborate plan it has clandestinely wiped three
wildlife sanctuaries off its records in iron ore-rich West Singbhum
district. These are Sasangda- buru in Saranda forest division,
Bamiaburu in Kolhan forest division and Songra or Tebo in Porahat
division.

The plan has been so meticulously executed that one has to sift through records of the past 55 years to unmask it.

These
sanctuaries have been mentioned in a report prepared by the now defunct
Indian Board for Wild Life (IBWL) on November 24, 1965, for a
delegation of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Bihar
(undivided), the report says, has seven protected areas — two national
parks and five sanctuaries. They also feature in the Indian Forest
Records: Glossary of terms used in nature conservation and wild life
management, published by the Forest Research Institute (FRI) in 1970.
