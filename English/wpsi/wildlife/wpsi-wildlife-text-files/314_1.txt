Bye bye crackers, hello birds

Department officials are probably on their way to distribute sweets in
Kollukudipatti, Vettangudipatti, and Krishnapuram villages as you read
this. Located on the fringes of Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary in Sivaganga
district, the villages have been refraining from bursting firecrackers
during Deepavali for several decades. The reason? People there want to
make sure their bird visitors are not bothered in any way. The
distribution of sweets is the Department’s way of thanking people for
their gesture. It is done every year with the District Forest Officer
leading the way.

The villagers though, do not expect anything in
return. “I’m 53 now and have not burst firecrackers at all,” says
forest department official K Karuppaiah (name changed on request) who
was born there.
