With the
number of elephants getting electrocuted and run over by trains and
trucks increasing, Odisha government has decided to launch a scheme,
Gajabandhu, for their safety and protection.

As part of the
scheme, which will be launched in villages surrounding elephant
corridors, the location and movement of elephants will be tracked, said
AK Mohapatra, outgoing chief wildlife warden of Odisha. A ‘Gajabandhu’
(friend of elephants) will lead a team assigned this task, which will
coordinate with field officials.

“We hope it would help in
preventing elephant deaths due to road accidents and man-animal
conflicts,” said Mohapatra. The government is also planning to
construct speed breakers at 65 locations in elephant corridors and
install CCTV cameras at some loacations, he added.
