GHAZIABAD:
A feline leopard was cudgelled to death by a mob in a village in
Garhmukteshwar on Monday evening even as forest department officials
waited for a tranquilizer dart fired at the cat to take effect. The
leopard had earlier seriously injured two policemen and had caused
minor injuries to five of the hundreds of villagers surrounding the
cat. The cat had been trapped by a mob in a sugarcane field. 

A
report was later filed by the Garhmukteshwar police under the
Protection of Wildlife Act against unidentified persons. A police
sub-inspector, with a wound on the neck, and a constable whose arm had
almost been chewed off while trying to save the sub-inspector, were
admitted to theMeerut Medical College Hospital. 

The permission
of the area chief wildlife warden is essential for killing a jungle
cat, even if it is a known man-eater. This leopard, however, had no
past record of violence against humans, said Ghaziabad divisional
forest officer, Yashpal Malik, who was present at the spot.
