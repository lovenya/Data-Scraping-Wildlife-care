Stop trawlers from fishing within 3 nautical miles: court

THE HINDU
CHENNAI, February 11, 2015

The
Madras High Court has directed the Advocate-General and the amicus
curiae in a suo motu case to sit together and work out a method to
ensure that no trawler or mechanised fishing vessel is permitted to
fish within three nautical miles of the coast.

The First Bench
comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M.M. Sundresh which had
taken suo motu cognisance of a press report on death of turtles, after
perusing the amicus curiaeâ€™s report, asked the Advocate-General, A.L.
Somayaji, and the Additional Solicitor General to scrutinise it. The
amicus curiae had said the nesting season was only till the end of
March and the mechanism under the existing law should be strengthened.
The assistance for increasing patrolling could be sought from the
Coastal Protection Group and the Coast Guard. This would ensure that no
trawler was permitted to carry on fishing activity within three
nautical miles from the coast.
