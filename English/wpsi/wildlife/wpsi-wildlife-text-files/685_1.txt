New
Delhi: The Union Government is convening a series of meetings from
Thursday with the 17 tiger-range states to discus the reasons for the
unabated deaths of the National Animal.

The Centre has expressed concern over the tiger deaths crossing the 50 mark this year.

According
to National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) sources, the first
meeting will be held with directors from tiger reserves from Northern
India such as Corbett, Dudhwa and Kaziranga.

The NTCA is convening the meet on behalf of the Centre.

The meetings with the directors of tiger reserves of Central and Southern India will be held in a phased manner by October 6.

Though
the government statistics maintains that at least 52 tigers have died
so far this year in the country, but the NGOs involved in the
conservation work estimates that, the toll would be over 60.

The conservationist attributed the tiger deaths to shrinking habitats, poaching and man-animal conflicts.

Though
the official statistics shows that 15 tigers were succumbed to
poaching, the NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) puts the
number at 23.

The NTCA says that out of 15 poaching incidents
reported from different parts of the country, ten poaching cases took
place outside protected areas.
