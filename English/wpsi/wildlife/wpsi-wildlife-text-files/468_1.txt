                        Â 
                        Sansar Chand, the notorious wildlife trader who is 
                          accused in about 14 cases in India, today had his Special 
                          Leave Petition (SLP) for anticipatory bail rejected 
                          by a Division Bench of the Supreme Court. Chand, who 
                          was not present in the court, was represented by the 
                          well-known senior advocate Mr. R. K. Jain. The SLP was 
                          in regard to an ongoing wildlife case in Udaipur in 
                          Rajasthan. Justice Balakrishnan dismissed Chand's petition 
                          and directed him to surrender to the trial court in 
                          Udaipur and apply for regular bail, which will be considered 
                          on its own merits.
