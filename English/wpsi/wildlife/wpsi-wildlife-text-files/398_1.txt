Wildlife conservation gets a boost with timely amendment

 

17 Jan 2022The
amendment to Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 2021, was introduced and
passed in the Lok Sabha and has been referred to a Parliament
committee. It is in the public domain for comments. This amendment aims
for “conservation, protection and management of wildlife” from the
earlier “protection of wild animals, birds and plants”.

Section
2-I6A defines exotic and invasive species of animals and plants whose
induction or spread may adversely affect animals, plants and their
habitats, with a provision in Sec-62A to control, check, regulate and
also destroy such alien species. It is very innovative to check and
control invasive, exotic weeds such as lantana, eupatorium and
parthenium in protected areas affecting the carrying capacity of the
habitats in terms of fodder, space, regeneration of trees and cause of
fires. Section 6A, an addition, has given powers to the state wildlife
boards to constitute “standing committees” for the purpose of
exercising powers and performing boards’ duties as may be delegated to
it by the Board, with sub-committees along the lines of the National
Board of Wildlife, whose standing committees’ powers too have been
enhanced.
