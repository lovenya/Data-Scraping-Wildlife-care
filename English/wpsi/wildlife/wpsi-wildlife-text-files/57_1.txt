Jalpaiguri:
A herd of wild elephants stood on the broad guage railway tracks
running through the Champramari Wildlife Sanctuary in the Dooars, about
65 kilometres from here, today morning holding up the New
Jalpaiguri-bound Intercity Express for about 25 minutes today.

The
Intercity Express had just left Nagrakata station at about 8.20 am and
had just crossed the Jaldahaka river, when the driver of the train
spotted the herd and applied the brakes bringing the train to a halt.
Behind it, the Delhi-bound, Mahananda Express was also held up.
