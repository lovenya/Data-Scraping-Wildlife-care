NEW
DELHI: New environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, on Thursday took
charge of his ministry amid challenges to deliver on multiple fronts -
be it taking strict air pollution abatement measures in cities,
striking a balance between development needs and environmental
protection, and ensuring India reach its goals under different global
commitments on biodiversity and climate change.

After taking the
charge, Yadav, a BJP member in Rajya Sabha, said he would make all
efforts to deliver on the responsibilities given to him by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi.Before
assuming charge, he planted a sapling inside the premises of the
environment ministry at Indira Paryavaran Bhawan in Jor Bagh in south
Delhi.

Yadav joined the ministry at a time when it came under
criticism for diverting wildlife habitat and forest lands for different
infrastructure works during the pandemic-hit year when movement was
quite restricted to assess the ground situation before taking any key
decision.
