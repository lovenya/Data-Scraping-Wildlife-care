Uttarakhand: National wildlife board approves Laldhang-Chillarkhal road

 

12 June 2021

DEHRADUN:
In a meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), chaired by
Union minister of forest, environment and climate change, Prakash
Javadekar, an approval was issued for the contentious
Laldhang-Chillarkhal forest motor road in Uttarakhand.

A communique from the chief minister’s office (CMO) on Friday confirmed this.

Last
week, TOI had reported that the state government had once again resumed
work on the 11.5-km road, which had been riddled in controversy as a
4.5 km stretch on it, from Chamaria bend to Siggadi Sot, is
ecologically-sensitive and the only wildlife corridor between Corbett
Tiger Reserve and Rajaji Tiger Reserve.
