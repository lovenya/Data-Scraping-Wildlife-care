Why capturing & translocating leopards won’t work in India’s dense cities

The
leopards in India have started to slowly change their spots, at least
in the public imagination. Studies and surveys from 2006 onwards
indicate that leopards are not merely a species limited to India’s
forests and wildlife sanctuaries.

Naturalists have long known
that leopards occupy a wide range of habitats, from farms to forests.
Still, without closer study, biologists and managers have earlier found
it difficult to ascertain whether the leopards in an area are residents
or merely transient visitors ‘straying’ outside forests and wildlife
protected areas, as frequently reported in news media.

A slew of
recent scientific studies and surveys, using trail cameras, radio
collars, and other field techniques, is now providing a better
understanding of leopards and gradually transforming conservation
actions as applied to the cat. The research also suggests that dealing
with leopards in human-dominated landscapes by capture and removal or
translocation to new areas is not as effective a solution as it was
once thought to be.
