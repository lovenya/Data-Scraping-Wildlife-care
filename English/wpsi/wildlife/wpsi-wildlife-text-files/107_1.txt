Poachers
remained active in forests of Odisha, eliminating 73 elephants in last
seven years since 2005 even as 157 people were arrested during the
period on charge of killing wild animals.
While hunters killed 57 jumbos by using guns, 16 elephants were poisoned to death by the poachers during the same period.

"A
total of 147 elephants have been killed since 2005," Forest and
Environment minister Bijayshree Rout today told in the assembly in
written replies.

Besides poachers, electrocution was another
factor responsible for the huge casualty of elephants. "At least 68
elephants died due to electrocution in different jungles since 2005,"
Routray said.
Six other elephants were killed in train accidents,
the minister said adding the state government had been working on
strategies on how to reduce jumbo casualty.

"The state
government has framed charges against persons responsible for the
killing of elephants and used to take help of Crime Branch of Police to
probe into cases related to elephant deaths," the minister said.
