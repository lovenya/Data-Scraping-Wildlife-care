                        18th May, 2004
                        Information provided 
                          by the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) helped 
                          the Kerala Forest Department to arrest a man with a 
                          fresh leopard skin near Bungalow, Muthanga Range, under 
                          Wynad Wildlife Division. Four men had been rounded up 
                          with the skin but unfortunately the understaffed Forest 
                          Department team managed to arrest only one. The operation 
                          was carried out under the able supervision of Range 
                          Officers Mr. A.K. Gopalan and Mr. Suresh. A POR has 
                          been registered in Muthanga Forest Range Office
                        The accused confessed that the animal had been killed 
                          in Muthanga itself some 20 days ago. It seems that the 
                          claws had been removed and sold separately. Names of 
                          various traders had also come up during the investigation. 
                          Leads provided by the accused during interrogation, 
                          regarding other traders, are being followed.
