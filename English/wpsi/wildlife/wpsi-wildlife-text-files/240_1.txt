NGT tells NHAI to construct flyovers along Rajaji in 12 months

 

28th March, 2019

The
National Green Tribunal on Thursday directed National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI) to complete construction of flyovers on
National Highway-74 adjoining Rajaji Tiger Reserve within 12 months.

The
green tribunal was hearing a petition on wildlife mortality on the
highway. The principle bench headed by Justice AK Goel, chairman of
NGT, issued the directions while hearing the petition filed by
Delhi-based advocate Gaurav Bansal.

The court also directed the
Uttarakhand government, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate
Change (MoEFCC), to take necessary actions to prevent road-kill in the
area. It directed the state government to submit its objections within
three weeks on the draft Tiger Conservation Plan proposed by the
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in January this year.

Dehradun-based
Wildlife Institute of India (WII), in a study conducted in 2017 named
‘Impact of national highways on wildlife in the Haridwar Forest
division’, had recorded 222 deaths of wild animals on National
Highway-74 which connects Dehradun to Haridwar.
