Sansar Chand in Judicial Custody 
15th JulyÂ 2005
                        On
14 July 2005, notorious wildlife trader Sansar Chand was sent to
judicial custody for the next 14 days by Mr. Manoj Jain, Additional
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of the designated wildlife court in the
Tis Hazari courts, Delhi.



Sansar had been in police remand with the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) since 1 July 2005, in connection with several new
tiger poaching cases filed against him.



The Rajasthan Police was also present in court today, seeking another
police remand for Sansar, in their custody this time. Sansar is wanted
in Rajasthan for the October 2004 seizure of leopard paws and claws in
Jaipur. Mr. Jain asked the Rajasthan Police to approach the Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate instead.



In a dramatic turn of events, the CBI also produced Sansar before the
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Ms. Reena Singh Nag, before taking him
to Mr. Jain's court.



Lawyers from the Wildlife Protection Society of India, Praveen Singhi
and Sanjay Kumar were present in the designated wildlife court
throughout, to observe the proceedings and assist the Court if
necessary.
