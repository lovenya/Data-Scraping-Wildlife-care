According
to the report, the villagers donated 203 bighas (around 33 hectares) of
land for NGO Hatibondhuto to plant paddy exclusively for the elephants
that often come down from the hills of the adjacent Karbi Anglong
district.

Many farmers from the Ronghang-Hatikhuli area do not
have enough land to even sustain their families, but still they have
donated land for the meal zone of elephants.

The work on the paddy field had begun two months ago.

The
locals have also planted saplings of 2000 outenga (elephant apple),
1500 jackfruit, 25,000 banana plants on barren land between the paddy
field and the 8-hectare grass plantation area.

Environmentalist Binod Dulu Bora is also associated with the project of creating this vast cropland for the elephants.
