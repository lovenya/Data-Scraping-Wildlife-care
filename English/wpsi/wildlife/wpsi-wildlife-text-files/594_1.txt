                        In a recently released question and answer paper, the Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) industry cleared  misunderstandings about
medicines manufactured by them and the use of tiger bone. The TCM leaders
stated that they have "moved beyond the tiger bone and are not
requesting any reopening of trade in tiger bone", as "effective
alternatives to tiger bone are widely available at reasonable
costs".In addition, TCM maintained that the "pressure to reopen
China's tiger bone trade came from tiger farm investors who hope to
capitalize on rekindling the Chinese public's demand for tiger bone wine
as a health tonic."
