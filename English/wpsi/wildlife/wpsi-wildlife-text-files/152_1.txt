Delhi: The Supreme Court has directed that elephants should be paraded
for festivals only by following the guidelines strictly.

The
apex court said it will issue a notice to the Animal Welfare Board of
India (AWBI) and various organisations of elephant owners in this
regard.

The court, in the notice, made it clear that those who violate the directive will be booked on charges of non-bailable offences.

Action will be taken against elephant owners and festival committees who violate the order for contempt of court.

The
apex court issued the directive on a petition filed by a voluntary
organisation based in Bengaluru. The petitioners argued that torturing
of captive elephants in the name of festivals is a violation of the
Wildlife Protection Act.

Earlier, the AWBI had reported that elephants which were paraded as part of Thrissur Pooram were tortured.
