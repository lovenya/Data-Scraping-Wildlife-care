NAGPUR, FEBRUARY 13
                        A tiger was
found dead in the Dhakna range of Melghat Tiger Reserve two days ago. T
U Shevte, Assistant Conservator of Forest, Melghat Tiger Reserve, told
The Indian Express that the cause of death appeared to be injury caused
by porcupine quills.

                        

“The sub-adult tiger’s legs had been pierced by a few sharp
quills. Apparently, it might not have been able to run and catch a prey
and eventually died of hunger,” Shevte said, adding, “but
this is just a preliminary observation. A post-mortem has been
conducted and a detailed report is expected soon.”

                        

Tigers have a special liking for porcupine meat, but often have
problems with its quills, which are difficult to remove. Leopards,
however, are known to have special skills in tackling the problem.
