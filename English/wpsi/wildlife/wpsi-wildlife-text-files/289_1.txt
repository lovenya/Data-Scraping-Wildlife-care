30 July 2019


Between
2015 and 2019, the environment ministry gave permission to cut more
than one crore trees doe development work. However, what’s not clear
here is that was the environment ministry really thinking about the
environment? Or should it be renamed to ‘Development At A Cost’
ministry?

Responding to a question in Lok Sabha, Minister of
State (MoS) for Environment Babul Supriyo said the ministry gave
permission to cut 1.09 crore trees for development purposes between
2014 and 2019.

He mentioned that out of all the five years, the highest number of trees were cut in 2018-19 for development.

"Trees
are felled for various development purposes with the permission of
competent authorities in accordance with the procedure laid down in
various Acts. However, the ministry does not maintain data regarding
the cutting of trees due to forest fire," Supriyo said.
