Tibetans Burn Furs in Dharamshala





20 February 2006





A public bonfire of animal furs was organised today in Dharamshala, by the Tibetan
Women’s Association, the Tibetan Youth Congress and other
NGO’s. More than thirty small articles decorated with furs
were burnt.



Many individuals came forward to give up chubas – old as well
as new – for the bonfire. The Tibetan Institute of Performing
Arts also donated several fur decorated items to the bonfire. 



Mrs. B. Tsering Yeshi, the President of the Tibetan Women's
Association, who had earlier interacted with WPSI officials, said that
the bonfire wasintended as a clear message to Tibetans who were involved with the illegal wildlife while living in India.



 “Because of a few individuals, the name of the
entire community gets besmirched,“ she said. “We
are committed to rooting out this problem forever.
