Smuggling
of wild animals and their body parts has again started adding to the
worries of officials from various agencies at airports across India.

According
to officials posted at the airports, recent cases have shown that
smuggling of wild animals has again started gaining pace. According to
sources, after almost two years, officials are seeing a frequency in
capture of animals and their parts in such large numbers. Flyers are
being arrested for trying to smuggle wildlife animals and their parts
to various countries, including Malaysia.

Around 11:30 am on
March 24 this year, officials noticed a suspected baggage during
screening at the Mumbai airport. When they called the owner
Thimarayappa Murthy, he initially said these were normal packets.
However, when Customs officials and Central Industrial Security Force
officials opened it, they found 161 tortoises stacked inside. According
to Customs officials, Murthy was supposed to smuggle these tortoises to
Malaysia by Malaysia Airlines flight number MH-195.

Similarly,
Customs department staff seized two suitcases filled with 183 turtles
at the Mumbai airport on April 10. They were being smuggled to Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. Customs people also arrested two passengers for
trying to smuggle these tortoises.
