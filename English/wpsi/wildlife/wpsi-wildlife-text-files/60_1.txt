Plantation owners' strategy draws flak

PALAKKAD:
Four environmental organisations have demanded that the State
government and the Forest Department take stern action against some
plantation owners who were trying to destroy the fragile ecology and
environment of the Nelliampathy forest area in Palakkad district.

In
a statement released at a media conference here on Wednesday, Tony
Thomas of One Earth One Life, S. Guruvayurappan of the Wildlife
Protection Society of India, Ashok Nemmara of the Ashrayam Rural
Development Society and A. Krishnankutty of the Janaseva Sanghom,
pointed out that Nelliampathy was one of 35 ‘bio-diversity hotpots'
that had to be protected.

This plea has a special resonance in
2011, which is being observed as the International Forest Year. But in
ecologically important areas such as Nelliampathy, some plantation
owners feel that the issue was not protecting the ecology but
protecting the plantations and their workers, they said.
