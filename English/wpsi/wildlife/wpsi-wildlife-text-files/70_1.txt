AR Recovers Banned Wildlife Products And Drugs

 




3/21/2011 

Keeping a
vigil for smuggling of banned wildlife produce and drugs to Myanmar, 42
Assam Rifles under aegis of 26 Sector Assam Rifles of IGAR (South)
intercepted a huge consignment of banned wildlife produce and drugs on
19 Mar 11.

At approx 0730 hours while carrying out checking of
vehicle at the Vehicle Check Post at Bongyang in Chandel District, a
surveillance party of Assam Rifles spotted a TATA Sumo vehicle bearing
registration number AS-11C-3109 parked suspiciously, short of the check
post to avoid the checking. On thorough check of the vehicle, Assam
Rifles confiscated 301 kg Pangolin shells, one leopard skin and 19 kg
of bones (including 04 leopard skulls). In addition to wild life
products, 2 lakh 32 thousand diclofenac tablets were also recovered
from the same vehicle. The driver of the vehicle Yamthang who is a
resident of Moreh, was apprehended with the items.

This
recovery, which is the biggest catch in recent times, is a result of
the strict measures being adopted by the Assam Rifles to break this
chain of smuggling in which wild life products and drugs are taken to
different countries through Myanmar and sold at exorbitant prices. The
banned wildlife products and drugs have been handed over to SP Imphal
West in presence of Forest and Wild Life officials at Imphal West
Police Station.
