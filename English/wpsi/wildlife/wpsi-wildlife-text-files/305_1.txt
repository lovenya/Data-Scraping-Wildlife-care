BHUBANESWAR:
The threat of electrocution in elephant-rich Dhenkanal district still
looms large as there are several sagging power lines dangling
dangerously. This is the state of affairs despite the fact that seven
elephants were electrocuted in Kamalanga forest area in November 2018
in the district due to sagging live wires.

There are at least
100 locations, where sagging of wires has been detected. The Wildlife
Society of Odisha (WSO), which works in the area, had surveyed and
found that sagging wires are yet to be fixed. “The threat of pachyderms
encountering sagging live wires is still very much there. The electric
poles, the elephants rub while roaming the forest, are yet to have
steel spikes around them. In the absence of spikes, the poles are
likely to fall on the elephants while rubbing causing electrocution,”
said WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty.
