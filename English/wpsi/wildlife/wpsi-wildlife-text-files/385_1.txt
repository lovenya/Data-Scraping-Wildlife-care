Interview: Indigenous-led conservation in Nagaland preserves rare wildlife

 

25 Aug 2021

The
mountainous state of Nagaland in northeast India lies in one of the
most biodiverse areas on Earth. More than half of the state is still
covered by forest. With only one small national park and two wildlife
sanctuaries, 88% of Nagaland’s forests are owned and managed by the
communities who live alongside them.

This year, the world’s
governments are negotiating a new framework of targets under the
Convention on Biological Diversity to prevent catastrophic biodiversity
loss and ecosystem collapse. Attention has turned to what targets like
protecting 30% of land and sea will mean in practice for communities
living in biodiversity hotspots. It is increasingly recognised 
that
the experiences and perspectives of indigenous people and local
communities must be at the forefront of protected area management and
design.
