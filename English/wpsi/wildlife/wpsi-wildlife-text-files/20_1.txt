New
Delhi (PTI): Forest officials have seized a leopard skin and other
banned wildlife products from Uttarakhand's Chamoli district and five
persons were arrested in this connection.

One of the arrested
Shyam Singh has been booked earlier in 2006 and early this year as well
for similar offences. In both the cases, he managed bail from local
courts, they said.

Singh was arrested on wednesday morning in a
joint operation by Wildlife Protection Society of India, Forest
Department of Uttarakhand and Special Task Force in Ranihut village.

Later
on his information, subsequent arrests were made. During the day long
operation, the officials seized one bear bladder, one musk pod and
three kilograms of rare hurb Yartsa Gumba.

"The Leopard was
killed in Chamoli district. The rest of the haul was collected by the
accused from different parts of the state," Program Manager WPSI Tito
Joseph told PTI.
