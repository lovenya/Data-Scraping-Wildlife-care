Chennai:
The Central agency will probe the suspected poaching of a male elephant
in Boluvampatti forest on January 5, 2021 and has cited two people from
Perur in Coimbatore, including a woman, as suspects. In another case of
suspected poaching that took place in the Sathyamangalam reserve forest
at Hosnur on December 19 2020, two poachers are suspected to be
involved. The third case taken up by the CBI is from 2014 when four
persons are suspected of poaching in the Udumalai forest range.

Earlier,
while ordering a CBI inquiry into the poaching and electrocution of
elephants on February 10 2021, the MHC had quoted a report of Wildlife
Crime Control Division in which it was alleged that the poaching
‘kingpin’ Eagle Rajan’s diary showed supply of ivory artefacts to high
profile individuals across the country, including a well-known
industrialist from Chennai, who had allegedly paid lakhs of rupees to
the poacher to purchase ivory.

According to the report quoted by
the High Court, the industrialist had hired artists from Kerala and
Marthandam (Kanniyakumari) to carve out ‘Mahabharatha’ and
‘Krishnaleela’ on the poached ivory.
