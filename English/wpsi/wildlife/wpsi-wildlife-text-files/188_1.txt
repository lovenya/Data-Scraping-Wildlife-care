New
Delhi: "We are being befooled by the executive", was how a "frustrated"
Supreme Court said on Tuesday while ruing the fact that around Rs one
lakh crore worth of funds meant to protect the environment and benefit
the people, was being diverted for other purposes. Severely criticising
the government, the apex court observed that it had "trusted" the
executive, but the authorities do not work. And when the court says
something, it is said that there is "judicial overreach and activism".

A
bench, comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, made it
clear that this huge amount of money, collected under various funds
created on the apex court's orders for the protection of environment,
was to be used only for environmental purposes and benefit of the
people. "It is very clear that the amount was used for purposes, other
than what it was entrusted. How far you want the court to go? We
trusted the executive but they say they will do whatever they want,"
the bench said.
