Salman Khan Convicted!


17th Feb., 2006

                        




Film star Salman Khan, arrested in 1998 for hunting blackbuck and
chinkara near Jodhpur, was sentenced to one year imprisonment today.
Another actor, who was allegedly part of the hunting party, has been
acquitted.  Khan and several other actors were arrested for
hunting while on location for a film. He now has a month to file an
appeal.

 

Khan’s hunting party was discovered when members of the local
Bishnoi community complained to the Forest Department that a group of
people had been illegally hunting in their area.

 

During the Forest Department’s investigations into the blackbuck
case, Khan’s driver Harish Dulani revealed that the actors had
made several hunting trips and earlier killed chinkara. The Forest
Department then filed cases in the local police station. It is in one
of these cases that Khan has been convicted today.

 

The Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), which has been
following the case since its inception, would like to congratulate the
Forest and Police Departments, and the entire prosecution team, which
managed to secure a conviction despite the fact that several witnesses
turned hostile or mysteriously disappeared.
