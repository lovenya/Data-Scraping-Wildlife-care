Three of four cheetahs born in India after 70 years die

 

26 May 2023Three
of four cheetah cubs born to a big cat brought to India from Africa
last year have died in Kuno National Park in the past week, forest
officials said, as a heatwave in the region sent temperatures soaring.

The
cubs were the first to be born in India in more than 70 years. Once
widespread in India, cheetahs became extinct there in 1952 from hunting
and habitat loss.

Their mother was among the 20 cheetahs that
India flew in from Namibia and South Africa as part of an ambitious and
hotly contested plan to reintroduce the world’s fastest land animal to
the South Asian country.
