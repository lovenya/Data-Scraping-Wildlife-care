Union environment ministry raises compensation to Rs5 lakh from Rs2 lakh for death and permanent incapacitation to humans 

New
Delhi: Holding that human-wildlife conflict has become a burning issue
in the past few years, the Union environment ministry has raised the
compensation for death and permanent incapacitation to humans to Rs5
lakh from up from Rs2 lakh earlier.

Harsh Vardhan-led Ministry
of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) earlier this month
also enhanced compensation for people suffering grievous injury, minor
injury or suffer damage to crop or property in human-wildlife conflict.

The
move is significant as every year hundreds of people are killed in
human-wildlife conflict and property/crops worth crores of rupees are
damaged across the country.

Between 2014-15 and 2017-18 (till
November 2017), a total of 1,557 people were killed due to
human-elephant conflict. During the same period, about Rs180 crore were
paid as compensation for loss of life (Rs37.31 crore) and damage to
crop/property (Rs143.27 crore) by elephants.

“Human-wildlife
conflict is one of the burning issues and is being raised in various
fora. Several representations have been received in the ministry to
take steps towards mitigation of human-wildlife conflict and to enhance
the compensation amount for death/injuries/damage to crops or
property,” noted a letter sent by MoEFCC to all states earlier this
month. The letter, dated 9 February, was reviewed by Mint.
