NEW DELHI/GURGAON: The definition of Aravalis, whose definition
of Aravalis, whose ambiguous interpretation has for years led to many
court battles for the protection of the ecologically fragile hill
ranges, has been decided by the Centre.
Removing all grey areas,
which have been consistently exploited to give Aravali land away to
real estate, particularly in Haryana, the Union environment ministry
(MoEFCC) has told the National Green Tribunal that the Aravalis across
NCR can be defined through their May 1992 notification.

Known as
the `Aravali notification', it says apart from reserved forests or
places already classified as `forest' in government records, areas
categorised as gair mumkin pahar (uncultivable hill), gair mumkin rada
(foothills, pastures), gair mumkin be hed (ravined foothills), banjar
beed (cultivable grassy foothills) and rundh (rocky areas between two
hills) will be treated as Aravalis.
