New
Delhi, Oct 14: The Supreme Court has upheld the order of the Madras
High Court which directed the demolition of all resorts and
constriction in the Mudumalai reserve forest area.

The order was
passed for the safe passage of migrating elephants. The SC also
appointed a sitting High Court judge to head a three-member committee
to inquire in the issues involving illegal constructions.

It may
be recalled that the Madras High Court had banned all construction
activities in the proposed elephant corridors. The elephant corridor in
the Niligiris is 22.64 kilometres long and 1.5 kilometres wide and is a
vital link for 900 elephants to traverse between the Eastern and
Western Ghats.

The Supreme Court had appointed an amicus curiae,
who had submitted a report. In the report, it was recommended to uphold
the validity of the Tamil Nadu government order dated August 21 2010
that notified the Nilgiris elephant corridor. Further a directive to
dismiss the special leave petitions filed against the Madras HC order
was also sought.
