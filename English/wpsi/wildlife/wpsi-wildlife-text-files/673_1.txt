BANGALORE: Alarmed over the spate of
tiger deaths in the country, the National Tiger Conservation Authority
(NTCA) has planned to raise a Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF), on
a par with the Central Paramilitary Forces, for the protection of
tigers in the country. Initially, out of the 37 tiger reserves, the
NTCA has selected 13 reserves where STPF will be deployed, with
Bandipur in Karnataka also being earmarked for three platoons of the
STPF.

In a letter addressed to all the chief wildlife wardens of
the 13 tiger reserves, NTCA chairman Rajesh Gopal has mentioned that
due to the endangered status of the tiger, a Special Tiger Protection
Force needs to be raised. He added it will be done with the active
involvement of the forestdwelling communities.

Giving details,
the chief wildlife warden of Karnataka B K Singh said, ?Recently a
meeting was convened in this regard, where we discussed about the
Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF).? Singh said each of the three
platoons to be deployed at Bandipur will consist of one range forest
officer (RFO), six foresters and 30 guards. Singh said all three RFOs
will come under the tiger force assistant conservator of forests, who
will head the company.

Though STPF would comprise of only forest
personnel, but around 30 % of the Special Tiger Guards would comprise
of forest dwellers. Singh, however ruled out any ex-army people being
part of the force.

BK Singh added, an annual budget of around Rs
3 crore has been set aside per company and a total of around Rs 50
crore for all the 13 companies.
