Early
this morning, acting on information supplied by WPSI, the Uttarakhand
Forest Department raided a location in Fatehpur Range, Ramnagar
Division, adjoining Corbett Tiger Reserve and seized a tiger skin, a
tiger skeleton, one spring trap and wooden lathis. WPSI personnel
assisted in the raid. Two poachers were arrested and four others are
absconding.

The unfortunate tiger, which is believed to be a
female, was allegedly killed in Fatehpur Range using a steel trap.
After the tiger was caught in the trap it was allegedly beaten to death
by the poachers using wooden lathis.

The raid was a joint
operation of the Uttarakhand Forest Department, the Haldwani Police and
WPSI. Three Forest Department divisions were involved and the operation
was led by Mr P.C Arya, Sub Divisional Officer of the Terai West
Division. Officers from the Terai Central Division and Ramnagar
Division were also present.

According to the latest tiger
estimation report, Corbett Tiger Reserve has one of the largest tiger
populations in India, so it should come as no surprise that the area is
being targeted by poachers. WPSI wildlife crime database has reports of
28 tigers that were killed by poachers in 2008.
