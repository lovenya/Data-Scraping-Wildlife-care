BHUBANESWAR:
Illegal trade of pangolin and its scales continues unabated in Odisha
as Athagarh Forest division officials on Thursday arrested three
poachers and recovered 19 scales and two loaded country riffles from
their possession. The poachers, also smugglers, are identified as Bagun
Laguri (48) from Paniama, Mangal Digi (40) and Lalmohan Chattar (55)
from Musulia.

They were arrested by an Athagarh forest team from
Subasi Forest Reserve in Khuntuni range of the division. Athagarh
Divisional Forest Officer Sasmita Lenka said the three arrested are
from the tribal community. “They were apprehended while they were
trying to sell the scales to traders in Subasi reserve forest,” she
said. The poachers kill the pangolin, extract its scale and sell it to
big smugglers who then export it outside the State..
