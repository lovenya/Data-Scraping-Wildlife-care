Uttarakhand plans to introduce rhinos in Corbett

 

27 Nov 2019



The
Uttarakhand wildlife advisory board on Tuesday approved a proposal for
the reintroduction of rhinoceros on an experimental basis in Corbett
Tiger Reserve, emphasising that the geographical terrain and
environmental conditions were suitable for the species, said Rajiv
Bhartari, chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand.

According to
wildlife experts, sighting of a male rhino near Kotdwara in Pauri
Garhwal district of Uttarakhand in 1789 confirms that rhinoceros have
existed in the Himalayan state in the past.

The proposal was
approved in the 14th meeting of the state wildlife board held in
Dehradun under the chairmanship of chief minister Trivendra Singh
Rawat, said Bhartari.

At the meeting, it was also stressed
Bhartari that introduction of rhinoceros in Corbett will also boost
wildlife tourism in the state.

Bhartari said Rhinoceros will
either be brought from Assam or West Bengal as the maximum population
of this species is there. “Before that a proposal will be sent to the
union environment ministry regarding the translocation,” he said
