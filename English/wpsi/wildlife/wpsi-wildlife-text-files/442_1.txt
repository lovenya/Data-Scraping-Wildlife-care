New Delhi: India has revised, after
40 years, its rules on the wildlife trade, although the exclusion of
some species from licensing restrictions has caused concern among
conservationists.

                        

The Union environment ministry issued a notification titled: Wild Life
(Protection) Licencing (Additional Matters for Consideration) Rules,
2024, providing guidelines on matters to consider before granting
licence to those dealing in captive animals, snake venom, trophy
animals, and stuffed animals. The revised notification was published on
January 18. Licensing rules published in 1983 were being implemented
until now.

                        

The rules published in 1983 state that no such licence shall be granted
to trade in a wild animal specified in Schedule I or Part II of
Schedule II to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, except with the
previous consultation of the central government.
