The
Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) has taken up several
initiatives in collaboration with government institutes to provide
alternative livelihood to the residents of Bali Island in Sunderbans in
West Bengal to reduce man-tiger conflict. 

WPSI is working with
Central Institute of Freshwater Agriculture (CIFA) and Central Inland
Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI) that are leading institutes under
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in this regard.

According
to a research paper titled 'Wildlife Man Struggle in West Bengal - A
Serious Social Issue', more than 150 incidents of tigers straying into
villages in Sunderbans have taken place. 
The
residents of Bali Island are being provided with facilities and
equipments for fish breeding, hatcheries and poultry products so that
they venture less into the forest. 

The CIFA has distributed
nets, fish seed, fertilizers as well as saplings of cauliflower and
cabbage to the people of Bali Island to enable them earn their
livelihood through agriculture and fishery. Measures are also being
taken to provide the islanders with basic veterinary training so as to
enable them to prevent the spread of disease in livestock.
