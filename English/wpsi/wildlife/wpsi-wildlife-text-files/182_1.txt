WPSI members said seizures and poaching cases only reveal a fraction of the demand and supply

                        

Pangolin scales , skins and bones of tiger and leopard, and rhino horns
were the most traded illicit wildlife products in India in 2017, found
a year-long analysis by New Delhi-based non-profit Wildlife Protection
Society of India (WPSI). These four protected species were most poached.

                        

While the number of seizures of leopard skin and bone was 101 this year
with 55 poaching cases, 16 seizures of tiger skins, bones and claws (19
poached) were reported from various parts of the country. Similarly, 11
cases related to smuggling of pangolin and its scales were reported
from six states (see box), and 13 cases of rhino poaching from Assam
and West Bengal.

                        

WPSI members said seizures and poaching cases only reveal a fraction of
the demand and supply, both in the national and international markets.
