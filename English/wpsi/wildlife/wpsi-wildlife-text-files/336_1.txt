17 April 2020




With
daytime temperatures breaching over 40 degrees Celsius in around a
dozen places in the state since last week, Odisha has topped the list
of states in the country concerning forest fires in the last one week.

According
to the Forest Survey of India’s (FSI), fire alerts issued based on the
SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership)-VIIRS (Visible
Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensor, at least 3531 fires were
recorded in Odisha, the highest in the country between April 9 and 16.
Maharashtra with 3203 fires in that period was at the second spot
followed by Madhya Pradesh with 2472 fires.

Though fire
incidents in Odisha are quite less this year compared to the same
period last year, the numbers are slowly rising. Between 9 and 16 April
2019, Odisha recorded 4429 fire spots while the same for the previous
year was 682.
