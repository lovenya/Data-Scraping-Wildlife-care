Seven
people were arrested in Kolkata’s Baguihati area on Sunday for
allegedly smuggling ivory. The seizure and the arrests were made on the
basis of a specific intelligence developed by the Wildlife Crime
Control Bureau (WCCB). The joint operation was conducted by the WCCB,
the Baguihati police station, and the Bidhannagar Police
Commissionerate. A case was registered at the Baguihati police station.

Several
instances of seizure of ivory and other wildlife products have come to
fore in Kolkata and Siliguri. Multiple agencies like the WCCB,
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, wildlife wing of the Forest
Department, and police have been involved in these seizures.

Pangolin
scales, freshwater turtles, geckos, elephant tusks, rhino horns, tiger
and leopard skins, and different species of birds are seized on almost
a regular basis.
