NEW
DELHI: All proposals for highways, railway tracks, canals and power
lines passing through wildlife sanctuaries and protected areas will now
have to include a plan to provide for safe movement of wildlife and
allocate budget for animal passages.

Linear infrastructure
project passing through protected areas and notified eco sensitive zone
around protected areas must submit an animal passage plan with a clear
budget head to get prior approval of National Board for Wildlife, a
standing committee of the apex wildlife protection body has decided.

The
standing committee, headed by environment minister Harsh Vardhan, made
this decision on January 25. This is the first time that animal passage
plan has been made binding on implementing agencies of infrastructure
projects. The meeting was attended by Wildlife Institute of India
director VB Mathur and National Tiger Conservation Authority officials
Debabrata Swain and Nishant Verma.
