These heartbreaking images show how India is slowly killing its elephants


 
10 October 2018

India has the world’s largest population of wild Asian elephants. It also has a colossal human-animal conflict problem.

When
award-winning conservationist Prerna Singh Bindra is asked what comes
to mind when she thinks about elephants in India, she says it’s no
longer wild herds wandering the vast Terai region or ambling across the
rolling Nilgiri Hills. Instead she thinks of trapped, chased and dying
herds.

She thinks of the Numaligarh makhna, an elephant so
perplexed by the wall erected along his traditional route in Assam that
he tried to bring it down and died of a brain hemorrhage. Or the
Athgarh herd, islanded in a mosaic of villages and fields in Odisha,
and subjected to the taunts of mobs of drunken men each evening. She
thinks of the Dharamjaigarh mother and unborn calf, who hit the ground
with the impact of an earthquake, after she was electrocuted by
high-voltage wires strung across a field in Chhattisgarh.

When
Bindra thinks about elephant watching, it’s no longer of mornings spent
on safari, marvelling at the mammoth beasts engaged in play and social
interactions.
