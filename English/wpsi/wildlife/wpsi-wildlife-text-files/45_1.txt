24-Hour Bird Rescue Helpline
 
15th August is around the corner...meaning the kite-flying season is here.

As
we know, The glass-coated string (maanja) used for kite-flying has
thousands of birds lose their wings and feet every year.  The
maanja cuts across wing/feet muscles and even cuts through bone – in
turn rendering a bird handicapped and unfit to fly for life. While
several birds are found lying helpless on the roads with severe wound
injuries, many more are found hanging by their wings on trees and
cables; entangled in maanja.

So this is the time to keep a close look-out for your feathered friends.

If you come across a trapped or injured bird in need, call at any of these 24-HOUR BIRD RESCUE HELPLINE NUMBERS -
 
9810029698, 9810129698, 9868355222, 9212111116.
 
And
dont forget to forward this to all your contacts. Let's ensure
that a maximum number of needy birds receive timely medical aid.
