8th March 2019

BHUBANESWAR:
In order to release aid early to the victims of attack by wild animals,
the State Government has amended the Wildlife (Protection) Odisha
Rules, 1974. The provisions of inquiry by police inspector and legal
heir certificate by tehsildar have been removed to provide speedy
compensation to the affected.

Exercising its powers under
section-64 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, the Government has
notified the Wildlife (Protection) Odisha Amendment Rules, 2019 which
allows a range officer to conduct inquiry into the matters related to
injury or death of person due to wildlife attack within three days and
submit the report to the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) concerned.

Based
on the DFO report, the forest officials will release the compensation
amount to the injured persons or kin of the deceased within 15 days.
The move is expected to help wildlife staff in bringing down man-animal
conflicts to a significant level and promoting goodwill amongst masses.

Wildlife
officials said at present, a large number of cases are pending for
payment of compassionate grant to victims and legal heirs of victims of
attack by wild animals due to non-receipt of police investigation
report.
