The
Eastern Vidarbha Landscape (EVL), home to Maharashtra’s largest tiger
population, is likely to witness a rise in human-animal conflicts
outside its protected areas, according to the findings of a
six-year-long study conducted by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII),
Dehradun.

The study has also, in a first in India, validated the
existing tiger corridors between Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR),
Brahmapuri, Umred Karhandla, and Navegaon-Nagzira, which will help put
in place protection measures.

Protected areas are wildlife
sanctuaries or park or bioreserves, which see around-the-clock movement
of tigers, according to the study. There are over 200 tigers inside and
outside the protected areas in eastern Vidarbha, which has a forest
cover of 22,508sqkm, about 37% of the total geographical area. Human
population in EVL is 1.45 crore. The total tiger population in
Maharashtra is in the range of 235 to 240, states the forest department.
