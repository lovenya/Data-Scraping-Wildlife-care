Tiger Poacher Arrested in Katni



17 July 2009


A
well-known tiger and leopard poacher, Durru Pardhi, was arrested in
Katni on Thursday, 16 July 2009. The operation was carried out by the
Madhya Pradesh Forest Department, led by Katni Divisional Forest
Officer, Mr A.K. Baroniya, with intelligence and assistance provided by
the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI).

Durru, aged
about 30 years, is believed to have killed dozens of tigers and
leopards in Karnataka and Maharashtra. He is wanted in the high-profile
2007 Gujarat lion poaching case, and is the prime absconder in the
December 2007 Karnataka case of the seizure of 65 skins. The
information for this case was also provided by WPSI. Durru is also an
accused in two cases in Maharashtra in 2006 that involve the seizure of
two tiger traps in Warsa Forest Division and five tiger traps near
Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary.

"We are thrilled that this habitual
tiger killer has been apprehended. This is a clear example of the need
and effectiveness of intelligence-led enforcement", said Nitin Desai,
Director Central India of the Wildlife Protection Society of India.
