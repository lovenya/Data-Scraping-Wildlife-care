Elephants' conflict of diet

 

13th Feb., 2019

A
heart-wrenching incident emerged from the Nagarhole National Park in
Karnataka last December. A 42-year-old elephant died after getting
stuck in a two-metre-high iron fence, set up by forest officials to
prevent wildlife from entering human settlements. The elephant had
reportedly crossed over the fence and raided nearby farms. When chased
away, it tried to return but got stuck. While its death sparked
criticism about the forest department’s strategy, the fact is
human-elephant conflict has emerged as one of the most nagging
conservation challenges in the country.

To drive away
crop-raiding elephants, farmers resort to all sorts of ways, from
beating drums and bursting crackers to erecting electric fences and
using spikes and fireballs. Union government’s Project Elephant
estimates that every year the conflict results in the death of over 100
elephants. Yet, they keep coming back to villages to raid farms or
destroy barns. Why do elephants take the huge risk?

This could
be because crops like paddy, corn, banana and jackfruit are superfoods
for elephants. Eating these enhances their state of mind and
well-being, says a study by post-doctoral researcher Sanjeeta Sharma
Pokharel, her advisor Raman Sukumar, professor at Centre for Ecological
Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and scientists
at IISc’s Department of Molecular Reproduction and Developmental
Genetics.
