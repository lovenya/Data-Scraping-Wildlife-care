Sansar Chand Gets Bail 
                        
                        21st May, 2004
                        In a shocking development, 
                          on 19 May 2004, the Special Sessions Court judge in 
                          Ajmer granted bail to notorious wildlife trader Sansar 
                          Chand. Efforts to keep him behind bars appear to have 
                          suffered a setback, and prosecution agencies will have 
                          to put in a greater effort to keep him in jail.
                        Conservationists who were following the 
                          ups and downs of the Sansar Chand drama were delighted 
                          when he was sentenced to five years imprisonment by 
                          the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate in Ajmer on 
                          29 April 2004. Although Indiaâ€™s Wild Life (Protection) 
                          Act allows for a sentence of up to seven years, Sansar 
                          is the first wildlife criminal to receive a sentence 
                          of this length. 
                        Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) 
                          has been following over ten cases involving Sansar Chand 
                          for over a decade, and we are well acquainted with the 
                          tricks employed by this wily trader and his lawyers. 
                          We remain optimistic about the eventual outcome of this 
                          case. Once it moves to a higher court, WPSI lawyers 
                          will be able to assist the prosecution in proving that 
                          Sansar is a habitual offender. He may have won a skirmish; 
                          he cannot win the war.
