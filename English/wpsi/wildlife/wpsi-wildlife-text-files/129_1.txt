GUWAHATI: Kaziranga lost its second rhino to poachers within a span of five days, taking the toll to 16 so far this year.

Park
director M K Yadav said a gang of poachers, armed with automatic
firearms, gunned down the rhino in the Agoratoli forest range of
Kaziranga on Friday. Yadav said the poachers managed to chop off the
horn and escape from the spot.

"The poachers' faces were covered
with black masks. After hearing the gunshots, our staff rushed to the
spot and fired back. But the poachers escaped along with the horn,"
Yadav said. Sources said the poachers could be militants from the
neighbouring Karbi Anglong district.
