‘UN rejection to give higher protection status to star tortoises a blow to India’s slow, steady efforts to save them’

The
United Nation’s (UN) Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has recommended that India’s
proposal for a higher protection status for Indian star tortoises, a
major wildlife species that is increasingly being smuggled out of the
country, be rejected.

The Indian star tortoise , which lives in
dry scrublands, grasslands, and coastal areas in south Asia, is
currently included in CITES Appendix II, which includes species that
are not ‘threatened with extinction’, but are allowed to be treated
under certain conditions. However, India wants the species to be added
to Appendix I to completely stop the illegal trade. The CITES
Secretariat said it was not clear what additional benefit an Appendix-I
listing would provide to the conservation of the species. “The
Secretariat recommends that this proposal be rejected,” the
recommendation said. India, supported by Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
Senegal, proposed to enhance the protection status to ensure stringent
trade control and improve scrutiny of captive-breeding operations.

The
reptiles are the world’s most illegally traded species of tortoise and
wildlife experts said they are being stolen from the wild in
unprecedented numbers for the pet and food industry.
