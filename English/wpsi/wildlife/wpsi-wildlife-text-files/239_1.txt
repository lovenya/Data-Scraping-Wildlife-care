Centre’s nod for mining in 170,000 hectares of forest in Chhattisgarh

 

21st March 2019

The
Union environment ministry has given environmental clearance for open
cast coal mining in Parsa in Chhattisgarh’s dense Hasdeo Arand forests,
in a decision that could have far-reaching consequences for forest
cover conservation in India.

Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest
contiguous stretches of very dense forest in central India, spanning
about 170,000 hectares. Parsa is one of the 30 coal blocks in Hasdeo
Arand and is owned by the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd
(RVUNL).

The mine, which has a capacity of 5 metric tonnes per
annum (MPTA), will be operated by Rajasthan Collieries Limited (RCL), a
unit of Adani Enterprises Limited. It received stage 1 forest clearance
in February this year, but the minutes of the forest advisory
committee’s meeting highlighted that a section of the 841 hectares to
be diverted for the mine lies in very dense forest.
