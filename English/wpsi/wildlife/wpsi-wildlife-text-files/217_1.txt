Forests with benefits: Why companies must pay forest communities for wild resources 

 

11th Jan. 2019



Every summer and winter, members of the Korku tribe near Melghat,
Maharashtra, don big cotton outfits covered in fine mesh and head out
to the forests.

Their mission is complex: they must collect wild
honey from the trees, but do so without killing the bees or destroying
the hive. So they delve carefully into the hive’s ‘kitchen’, extracting
the honey without damaging the rest of the structure. “That’s the only
section that has honey. It is so unnecessary to break the entire hive,”
says Gajanan Kale, a conservationist who works with Korku tribals. This
way, the bees can reuse the hive three times.

Sometimes wild
resources can indeed be harvested sustainably. But sometimes, they are
not. And as consumers who thrive both on dadima’s nuskha (home remedy)
and luxury ayurvedic brands, we don’t know where our arjuna bark or
forest honey come from, and how they are extracted.
A wild idea

In
truth, there are several aromatic, medicinal or rare biological
resources used in industry, not all of which support sustainable
pickings, or share profits with local communities, who are the true
guardians of these resources. Now, a landmark judgment from the
Uttarakhand High Court last month sets out to change that.
