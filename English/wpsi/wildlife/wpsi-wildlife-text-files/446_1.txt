Gamini, the female cheetah from
South Africa being translocated into KNP (Kuno National Park) in
Sheopur gave birth to 6 litters (cubs), and not 5 as reported earlier
on March 10, 2024. With it, the headcount has increased to 27 cheetahs
(14 cubs and 13 adults) in KNP.

                        

Though the sixth cub mysteriously hoodwinked the hawkish eye of
veterinary doctors’ team, he/she survived owing to the security cover
provided by the mother Cheetah Gamini. According to wildlife experts,
the first-time pregnant female cheetah can give birth to 4 to 6
cheetahs, which is a record of sorts. Gamini has set a record for
herself to be the wild cat in KNP that delivered six cubs.
