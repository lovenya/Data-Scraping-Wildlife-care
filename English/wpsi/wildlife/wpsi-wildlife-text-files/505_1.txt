Clouded 
                        Leopard Killed in Buxa 
                        
                        1st Dec., 2004
                         A group of poachers 
                          killed a highly endangered clouded leopard in Buxa Tiger 
                          Reserve, West Bengal, on 23 November 2004. This is the 
                          second incident of poaching in the same area of the 
                          Reserve within the last six months. 
                        According to Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) 
                          sources, around 10 poachers entered the Reserve from 
                          the neighboring state of Assam and were challenged by 
                          a Forest Department patrol. After an exchange of fire 
                          from both sides, the poachers fled the scene. They left 
                          behind the carcass of a 5 to 6 year old female clouded 
                          leopard. The body was burnt after the post mortem was 
                          conducted inside the forest. 
                        Forest officials also recovered some locally manufactured 
                          arms from the site. No person has been arrested so far.
                        The Reserve has a long border with Assam, and a porous 
                          border with neighboring Bhutan. These factors, coupled 
                          with a difficult terrain, make it relatively easy for 
                          poachers to enter the Reserve. In March, poachers had 
                          killed a tusker in the same area, but could not be apprehended.
