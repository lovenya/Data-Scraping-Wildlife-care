PCCF seeks action plan to curb electrocution

 

9 Feb 2022Nagpur:
Taking serious note of the series of tiger and leopard deaths due to
electrocution, the state’s chief wildlife warden (PCCF) Sunil Limaye
has asked all the chief conservators of forests (CCFs) and field
directors of tiger reserves to draw an action plan for 11kV lines and
illegal power fences around farms, and a working model to tackle
electrocution.

In a directive issued on February 1 to all forest
officials, Limaye has asked them to submit a report by February 10. The
PCCF (wildlife) has also cited a ruling by the National Green Tribunal
in January wherein Tamil Nadu Electricity Board was asked to pay Rs75
lakh to the forest department, holding it responsible for electrocution
of wild animals.

Limaye told TOI that forest officials have been
asked to work on the action plan submitted by the Wildlife Protection
Society of India.
