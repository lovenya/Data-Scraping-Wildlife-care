NEW
DELHI: After rejecting recommendations of the Sonia Gandhi-led National
Advisory Council (NAC) to strengthen Forest Rights Act, the Centre has
decided to take all suggestions on board and introduce an amendment
bill in the current Parliament session.

The tribal affairs
ministry will bring the amendment bill to correct basic contradictions
within the Forest Rights Act that had been pointed out by NGOs before
NAC last year. NAC had sent these suggestions to the ministry in
February, 2011.

Interestingly, the same suggestions were
rejected by tribal affairs minister Kantilal Bhuria. After V Kishore
Chandra Deo assumed charge, Gandhi wrote to Deo, asking him to consider
the suggestions once again. As per sources, the same suggestions have
now been incorporated into the bill in totality and a note has been
prepared for Cabinet approval.
