Sansar Remains with Rajasthan Police


26th July 2005

                        

The Rajasthan Police produced Sansar Chand before the Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate of the Tis Hazari courts, Mr. Manoj Jain, on 25
July 2005.

                        

Sansar has been wanted by the Rajasthan Police since the October 2004
seizure of leopard claws and paws in Jaipur. After his dramatic arrest
by the Delhi Police on 30 June 2005, he was sent to the custody of the
Central Bureau of Investigation. The Rajasthan Police finally obtained
custody of Sansar on 15 July 2005.

                        

After hearing the proceedings, Mr. Jain allowed the Rajasthan Police to
take Sansar back to Jaipur for further investigations. Sansar will now
be produced on 8 August 2005.
