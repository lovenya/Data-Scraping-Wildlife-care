After
the death of nearly 100 wild elephants due to electrocution in Odisha
within a decade, a solution may be in sight to save the National
Heritage animal.

After a meeting  with senior
representatives from the Environment Ministry, State Government and
NGOs, Reliance Infrastructure, which own a 51 per cent in three of the
four power distribution companies in the State, has committed to attend
to the sagging power lines in elephant habitats along with taking other
necessary steps to protect the tuskers.

The parties also agreed to reconvene in six months to discuss and develop the plan of action.

The
meeting was hosted by the UK charity Elephant Family that has been
supporting initiatives to redress the situation through its partner
organisation, the Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO) and the Wildlife
Protection Society of India (WPSI).

According to Biswajit
Mohanty, secretary, WSO, member organisation of National Board for
Wildlife, the meeting pointed to the urgent need to overhaul large
parts of the distribution network, including pulling up sagging
overhead power lines, installing circuit breakers, and placing barbed
wires around electricity poles.

“There is also a need for the
distribution companies to comply with mandatory regulations for the
installation, maintenance, and inspection of power lines set by the
Central Electricity Authority of India”, pointed out Belinda Wright
from WPSI.
