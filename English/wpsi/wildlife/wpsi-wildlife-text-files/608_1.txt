The Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) provided intelligence
and assisted in a huge wildlife enforcement operation in northern
Karnataka in the early hours of this morning. Sixty-five skins were
seized – one tiger skin, 21 leopard skins and 43 otter skins. A
well known wildlife trader called Prabhakar was arrested.

                        

Prabhakar is said to have been in the trade for years. He purchases the
skins directly from poachers and allegedly controls most of the illegal
wildlife trade in south India. In the past he is known to have supplied
skins to the notorious wildlife trader Sansar Chand in Delhi. Prabhakar
is an active political worker and is believed to have considerable
local support.

                        

The Karnataka Police CID Forest Cell, which is headed by Inspector
General of Police, K.S.N. Chikkerur, conducted two raids in the town of
Hubli and the village of Haliyal. The raiding party was led by Deputy
Superintendent of Police, Mr Narayan Swami.

                        

“This second large seizure within just a few days, is a serious
wakeup call on how swiftly we are loosing our wildlife to the illegal
wildlife trade”, said Belinda Wright, Executive Director of WPSI.

                        

“We will loose this great national treasure if we do not make
curbing wildlife crime a priority and use intelligence-led enforcement
to curb this menace”, added Nitin Desai, WPSI's Director Central
India and a member of the Government of India's Advisory Group for the
Wild Life Crime Control Bureau.
