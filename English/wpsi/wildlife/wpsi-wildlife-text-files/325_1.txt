KATHMANDU:
Nepal will allow India to take home 173,072 kgs of red sandalwood that
it had confiscated during the last 10 years while it was being smuggled
to China from India through the Nepalese territory, according to a
media report.

Both Nepal and India are parties to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES), a multinational treaty which has stipulated a provision of
returning confiscated contraband to the country of origin.

The
Nepal government said that India can take home 173,072 kilograms of red
sandalwood within 90 days, the Himalayan Times reported on Thursday.

"The
red sandalwood would be handed over to the concerned Indian authority
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as per Article VII of the
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
Control Act-2016," Minister of Communications and Information Gokul
Prasad Baskota said during a press conference here.

He also said that the transportation cost for returning the precious wood will be borne by India.
