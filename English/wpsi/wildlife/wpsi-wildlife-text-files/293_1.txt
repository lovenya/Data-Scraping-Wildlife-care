Jumbos in trouble: Asian elephants set to lose almost half of their present habitat, says study

India
harbours approximately half of the total population of the endangered
wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). They need large areas for
survival and are considered as “umbrella species” as their conservation
also protects other species that occupy that same habitat. 

However,
like many other animals, elephants are also facing the heat of a
changing climate, and are a victim of habitat loss. In a recent study,
an international team of researchers from India, Spain, Nepal, Myanmar,
Italy and Germany has examined how climate change and human activities
affect the distribution of the Asian elephants in India and Nepal. The
study was 
published in the journal Diversity and Distributions.It
is well-known that climate change regulates the distributions of
species through temperature and the availability of water, or through
modifications of their habitats.
