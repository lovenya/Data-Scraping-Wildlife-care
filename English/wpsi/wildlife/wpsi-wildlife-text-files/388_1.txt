GUWAHATI: On
World Rhino Day on Wednesday, Assam set on fire a large stockpile of
over 2,400 rhino horns, which were extracted from naturally or
accidentally dead rhinos as well as those confiscated from arrested
poachers and stored for over four decades in government treasuries, to
stop the illegal trade in rhino horns.

Chief minister Himanta
Biswa Sarma, who personally supervised the event at Bokakhat amid the
chanting of Vedic rituals and blowing of conches, said they wanted to
prove the common belief that rhino horns have miraculous medicinal
properties is a myth. The horns, extracted by poachers after killing
the animals, have a huge illegal market in several countries,
especially Vietnam, where they are prized for their aphrodisiac
qualities and command a high price.
