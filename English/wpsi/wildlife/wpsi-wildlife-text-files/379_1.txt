HYDERABAD:
In what could be one of the biggest wildlife trafficking cases in
Telangana this year, forest officials seized about 240 pangolin scales
and arrested three poachers hailing from Golleti village in Rebanna
mandal of Komaram Bheem Asifabad district.

The value of the
seizure is estimated at several lakh rupees. The illegal trade came to
light after the district forest officer S Shantaram received a tip-off
from an informer in Bihar.

“We got a call from a reliable source
that a person had put the pangolin scales for sale on social media. On
receiving this information and a contact number, we immediately decided
to conduct an undercover operation to arrest the accused.
