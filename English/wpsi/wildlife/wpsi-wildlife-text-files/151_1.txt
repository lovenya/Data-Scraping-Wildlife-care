The
increase in the Asiatic lion population in Gujarat forests is surely a
reason to rejoice for the state government and to pay reverence to the
people of Saurashtra region for nurturing the wild cat while taking all
inconveniences in their stride. But it is in the very impressive number
- 523 lions, up from 411 in 2010 - that hides a tough challenge of
conservation.

The 2015 census, which was the biggest ever
covering as many as 22,000 square km, has found a rise of only 4.4 per
cent or 14 lions in the sanctuary and protected forest areas while
there has been a mind-boggling increase of 130 per cent or 96 lions in
areas of human habitation with increasing commercial activities.

"It
is to the credit of the local population that the lions have survived,
flourished and grown, but the fact that the growth is happening outside
the protected area in what are essentially human-dominated landscapes
cannot remain a happy situation forever," points out renowned wildlife
expert Ravi Chellam, who has worked extensively on Gir lions.

He maintains that the Supreme Court judgment regarding translocation of lions is still valid and needs to be implemented. 

The
reason for as many as 14 lions getting killed during last one year
alone in accidents, including 10 in rail mishaps, lies in the dispersal
of the king of the jungle in search of prey base and water. Forest
officials said that this is because the carrying capacity of the
protected areas is only 260 lions.
