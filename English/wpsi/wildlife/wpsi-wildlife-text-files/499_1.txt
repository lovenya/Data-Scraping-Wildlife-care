                          the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Jaipur, who remanded 
                          them to judicial custody up to 26 October.

                          (WPSI) visited Jaipur on 19 October to hold discussions 
                          with police officials, and to provide the latest trial

                        Mr. Surendra Singh Rathod, the main Investigating Officer 
                          (IO) and the SHO of Manakchowk Police Station, has promised

                        WPSI has also requested the SHO to seek assistance 
                          of its Jaipur based lawyer in order to expedite the
