Orissa HC summons chief wildlife warden over rising elephant deaths

 

26 July 2022Orissa
high court on Monday asked the state’s chief wildlife warden to appear
before it via video conferencing on August 8 and file a response over
rising elephant deaths.

This development comes a day after the
Special Task Force of Odisha police recovered burnt bones and ashes of
elephants from two different places under Dhama Forest range of
Sambalpur district bringing the forest department staff under the
scanner again.

The HC direction to chief wildlife warden Shashi
Paul came in response to a PIL filed by a Cuttack-based wildlife
activist seeking amendment to the Wildlife (Protection Act), 1972 on
the lines of the Wildlife (Protection) (Assam Amendment) Act 2009 to
add more teeth to wildlife crime control efforts.
