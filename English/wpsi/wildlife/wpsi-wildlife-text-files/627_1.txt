Attached
is a statement that we have released regarding the relocation of tigers
to Panna Tiger Reserve. We are deeply distressed by the way the Madhya
Pradesh authorities have carried out this operation and have requested
that further translocation of tigers there be stopped, and that a
high-level inquiry be instigated into the disappearance of up to 40
wild tigers in Panna. There is now no evidence of any tigersleft in
Panna and it is imperative that the reasons for this are identified,
and the causes of the tragic decline eliminated, before the
re-introduction of any tigers from Bandhavgarh or Kanha.

The
statement has been sent to the Prime Minister of India, the Chief
Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the Member Secretary of the
National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Secretary of the Minister of
Environment and Forests, the Principal Chief Conservators of Forests
and Chief Wildlife Wardens of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan,and the
Field Directors of five Tiger Reserves - Bandhavgarh, Kanha,Panna,
Ranthambhore and Sariska.

Our national animal the tiger is under grave threat and we would be grateful for your support on this important matter.Brijendra Singh
