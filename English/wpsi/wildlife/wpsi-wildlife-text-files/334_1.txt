CBI takes over Lakshadweep sea cucumber poaching probe

 

21 March 2020




The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday took over all major sea cucumber poaching offence cases in Lakshadweep.

The
decision was taken during a meeting at the CBI headquarters in New
Delhi on Thursday based on the recommendation of the Wildlife Crime
Control Bureau of India (WCCB), which was initially investigating the
cases.

“Sea cucumber is an endangered species and vulnerable to
poaching even though it receives the highest protection status. WCCB
has paid special attention towards saving this species by collecting
intelligence, coordinating operations and creating awareness among
enforcement agencies including coastguard, police and forest along our
coastline, and fishermen. The present seizure is a reflection of these
efforts. The investigation being taken up by CBI will go a long way in
helping bust this transnational illegal trade of sea cucumbers.
