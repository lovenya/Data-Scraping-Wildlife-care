In a first, Uttar Pradesh begins otter census

 

6th March 2019

For the
first time, Uttar Pradesh is taking a census of otters in its protected
areas. The exercise that began in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR),
will be completed by the end of this month.

“Otters are an
important part of the forest ecosystem. A thriving population of otters
means a healthy ecosystem,” said H Raja Mohan, director of PTR. “We
have installed as many as 30 cameras in the reserve for the purpose,”
he added

A mammal, an otter spends much of its time in or close to water bodies. Otters live on fish.  

PTR
is in the foothills of the Himalayas, south of Nepal. Covering an area
of approximately 800 square kilometres, the reserve sprawls across
parts of Pilibhit, Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich districts.

With the Sharda and Ghaghara rivers encircling a considerable part of the reserve, it is rich in water bodies.

The
forests of PTR are to home to tigers, leopards, elephants, different
species of deer and monkeys and reptiles like snakes, mugger crocodiles
and gharials.

“We keep a tab on the number of bigger animals
like tigers or elephants but now we decided to have a census for
otters,” said Mohan. “A growing or healthy population of otters means
the water bodies of the reserve are pollution-free. Clean water bodies
mean a healthy ecosystem of the forest.”
