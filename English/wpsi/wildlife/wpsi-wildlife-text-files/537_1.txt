One tiger skin and three leopard skins were seized and two people
arrested in Uttar Pradesh, near the Indo-Nepal border, on 10 October
2005. The seizure and arrests were the result of a joint operation by
the
staff of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and the Shashastra Seema Bal (SSB), which
guards the Indo-Nepal border.Â  One of the accused is a resident of
Uttar Pradesh while the other is from Nepal.

                        

The seizure is yet another instance of how wildlife crime continues to
flourish in the region because of the porous Indo-Nepal border. 

                        

Meanwhile, the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) has received
reports that on 11 October 2005 the Border Security Force seized a pair
of ivory tusks in Tripura. 

                        

On the same day, Police and Forest officials in the Sonitpur district
of
Assam seized a full grown clouded leopard skin. Three people were
arrested, including two tea garden workers. They had bought the skin in
the Lakhimpur district of Assam, from people who were probably trying
to
make some quick cash before the festival season. Investigations are
on.
