Bhubaneswar:
For Odisha’s fast dwindling wildlife, life continues to be stressful,
fraught with risks, a daily struggle for food in a fast depleting
habitat. In the last nine years and six months (since April,2010), 727
elephants have died of which, 257 elephants (more than 35 per cent,)
have died due to unnatural causes – 113 to electrocution, 77 to
poaching, 26 to poisoning, 26 to train accidents, five to road
accidents and 10 after falling into manmade structures like open wells
and irrigation projects.

The reasons for death could not be
ascertained in 147 cases as carcasses are found in decomposed state and
some just skeletal remains.

While tiger population has gone up
in most Indian states, in Odisha, it has come down or remained static.
In 2004, the state had claimed the presence of 192 tigers which came
down to 28 in 2014.
