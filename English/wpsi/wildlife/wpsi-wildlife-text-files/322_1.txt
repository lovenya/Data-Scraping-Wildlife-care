High rate of green clearances continue, puts forests and wildlife at risk

 

11 Dec 2019



A
latest analysis of the forest and wildlife clearances recommended by
expert panels of the environment ministry, in the first six months of
2019, has found that most projects seeking diversion of land from
forests, wildlife reserves and similar eco-sensitive areas were given a
green light by the experts. However, the high rate of clearances for
projects is not in sync with the core purpose of the wildlife and
forest acts, meant to protect animals and forests from human activity
and disturbance, the analysis has found. 

The analysis by the
Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE), an organisation
working on environmental law, has revealed that the panels recommended
clearance for diversion of land from forests, wildlife sanctuaries,
national parks and tiger reserves in the majority of the cases it
considered without considering the impact of such projects on forests
and wildlife.
