4 March 2021



In
perhaps the first such instance in Jharkhand and Odisha, a forest
division team from Rourkela sought to detain the driver and the goods
train which had mowed down two elephants early on Thursday.

The
goods train hit and killed the elephants near Mahipani level crossing
close to Jeraikela railway station which falls under Bisra range of
Rourkela forest division in Sundergarh district of Odisha around 1am.

The tracks pass through an elephant corridor where the incident happened.

Around
8am, a team of Rourkela forest division, led by assistant conservator
of forests Dilip Kumar Sahu, reached Manoharpur station under
Chakradharpur division of South Eastern Railway in West Singhbhum
district of Jharkhand where the goods train had stopped, to detain the
driver and the train.
