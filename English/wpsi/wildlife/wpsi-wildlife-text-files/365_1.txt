Nainital:
The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday took suo motu cognisance of
the denotification of the Shivalik Elephant Reserve – Uttarakhand’s
only elephant reserve — and issued notices to both the state as well as
the central government. The division bench of acting Chief Justice Ravi
Malimath and Justice Alok Kumar Verma issued the notice.

Speaking
to TOI, an advocate who wished to remain anonymous said, “ The court
has given the respondents four weeks to file their counter affidavits
in the matter and has listed the case for further hearing after the
winter vacations.”

According to court records, the central
government as well as officials of the state government like the
principal secretary forest and environment, principal chief conservator
of forests (general), principal chief conservator of forests
(wildlife), chief wildlife warden, state wildlife advisory board and
director of Rajaji National Park have been made respondents in the
case.
