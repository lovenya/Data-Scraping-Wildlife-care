far, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) — a paramilitary force that guards
the 1,751-km Indo-Nepal and the 699-km Indo-Bhutan border — has notched
up major successes in its drive against wildlife crime.

The SSB
crackdown against wildlife crime has netted major cache of endangered
species like tokay gecko, lizards, and prohibited items, like snake
venom, tiger and leopard skins and bones, elephant tusks and ivory,
