NEW
DELHI: Amid calls for balancing economic development with environment
protection, a senior Supreme Court judge on Sunday said if the apex
court's actions to save the environment amounted to judicial overreach,
then it would continue for a long time.

"If we find that it
(apex court's direction to save environment) has not been complied
with, then somebody may have to pay a price for that," Justice TS
Thakur said on the concluding day of an international conference on
'Global Environmental Issues'.

Justice Thakur's remarks came in
response to power and coal minister Piyush Goyal's statement blaming
"judicial overreach" for stunting growth.

Emphasizing that the
government has to ensure adequate job opportunities and also ensure
that economic development is not at the cost of environment
degradation, Goyal said, "It is very important to understand that
sometimes, judicial overreach or sensationalization of a particular
subject can cause more damage than growth."

Goyal, however, said
he believed in pragmatic judicial review as it was necessary to see
whether the government's actions were adequate to save the environment.

Picking
up on Goyal's reference, Justice Thakur, who addressed the gathering
after the minister's speech, reminded him of the government's poor
record in cleaning the Ganga, implementing afforestation programmes and
preventing encroachments on floodplains in Jammu and Kashmir that led
to last year's flooding of Srinagar.
