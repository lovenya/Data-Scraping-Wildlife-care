The
birds are suspected to have been sent from West Bengal and sourced from
Bangladesh for a client in Bengaluru. Investigators suspect involvement

from the train on Wednesday following a tip-off. A DRI team carried out
searches at KSR City railway station after the train from Kolkata
chugged into the railway yard.“Inspection
of one of the bogies revealed a section covered with tarpaulins. We
removed them only to discover cages containing the birds. Sadly, they
had been without food and water for days during the journey,” said a

A total of 15 macaws and a few love birds,
which were crammed into the cages, were shifted to the care centre.
They are recovering well, sources said.
