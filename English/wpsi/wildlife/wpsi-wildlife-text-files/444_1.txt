NEW DELHI: India, Bangladesh,
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have planned coordinated crackdowns on
wildlife trafficking kingpins operating through their jurisdiction by
sharing criminal intelligence and breaking down their financial flows,
officials said. During the two-day Regional Investigative and
Analytical Case Meeting (RIACM) on Exotic Species Trafficking organised
by the CBI and Interpol here recently, experts deliberated on four
crucial routes used by the traffickers to transport exotic species.The
term exotic species refers to those not part of native wildlife in a
particular habitat or geographical area.

                        

It has emerged that air cargo is the most common route used by
traffickers to smuggle exotic wildlife from Africa to Southeast Asia
and then to India and China, officials said.
