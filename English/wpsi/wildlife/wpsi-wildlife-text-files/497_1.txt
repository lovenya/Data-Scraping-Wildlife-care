                        17th Sept., 2004
                         A magnificent male 
                          tiger was found dead 25m off the Chimur-Warora State 
                          Highway in the Chimur Forest Range of Chandrapur District, 
                          Maharashtra on 14 September 2004. The tiger was killed 
                          about 7 km from the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, in 
                          a collision with an unknown speeding vehicle. A post 
                          mortem revealed extensive internal injuries including 
                          six broken ribs, and a ruptured kidney.
                        The body of the tiger was burnt on the evening of 14 
                          September in the presence of forest officials and WPSI's 
                          Central India representative. 
                        After the burning, two forest guards stayed behind 
                          to tend to the dying embers. They reported that at 5.45 
                          pm a tigress started calling nearby - they said that 
                          "her long drawn out moans filled the forest". 
                          Forest guards had reported seeing two sets of fresh 
                          tiger pugmarks in the area on 9 September, and a group 
                          of villagers had briefly seen the two tigers on 6 and 
                          7 September.
                        The Maharashtra Forest Department is planning to put 
                          up reflective signs asking drivers to slow down. They 
                          are also liasing with the Public Works Department to 
                          have speed breakers put up at strategic places on the 
                          road. WPSI is assisting the Forest Department.
