The mysterious death of a
tigress in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve on Tuesday has left the future
of its three cubs in a quandary.

While there is still no
official statement about the lactating tigress? death, Bandhavgarh
director Chandrakant Patil did not rule out the possibility of
unnatural death as the cause.

Although primary autopsy of the
six-year old tigress has not helped the officials zero in on the reason
for the death, sources said it could have been a case of poisoning.

"We
have sent the viscera and some other body parts to forensic labs in
Sagar and Jabalpur," said Mr. Patil, adding that "anything conclusive
canbe said only after the forensic results are out."

The
Bandhavgarh Reserve is home to around 50 tigers.

The sources
said the cubs might be shifted to a zoo. Mr. Patil, however, said:
"They won?t be shifted to a zoo; we will keep them in Bandhavgarh,
perhaps in an enclosure to ensure their safety."newslink
