Ghati,
Gadchiroli : Over the last one year, villagers of Ghati in Gadchiroli
have kept timber out of the forest department’s reach, saying it
belongs to them under the provisions of the FRA, short for Scheduled
Tribes and Other Traditional Forest-Dwellers (Recognition of Forest
Rights) Act.

The FRA recognises their rights only on non-timber
minor forest produce but the villagers have interpreted it to include
all trees. They say minor forest produces like mahua, tendu, berry,
gum, edible fruits and roots grow on trees; hence no tree can be
harvested. They also cite a provision bestowing on the village the
responsibility of conserving wildlife and biodiversity, saying this
means even the forest department cannot touch trees without the gram
panchayat’s permission.

They have not allowed any forestry work
in the 521 hectares for which it has got the title under the Act’s
community rights provision, besides another 381 hectares of adjoining
reserve forest they claim as theirs.

The village, with a mixed
population of 1,213 mostly comprising non-tribals, has a gat (block)
gram panchayat. The two other villages under the gram panchayat, Kuradi
and Pendawada, have such no issues with the forest department.

Ghati
gram sabha president Pitambar Thalal says: “We won’t allow them to cut
trees without our permission since under the Act the responsibility of
protection now rests with us. The government is our servant and we are
their paymasters. Can the master allow the servant to run away with his
property?”

He adds, however, that “forest guards and officials are free to carry out protection duties.”
