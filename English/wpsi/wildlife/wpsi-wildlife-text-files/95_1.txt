Haldwani-Rampur road widening a big threat

Widening
of the Haldwani-Bareilly-Rampur road via Lalkuwa may come as a major
setback for the revival of the traditional Gola elephant corridor as a
large part of forest land along the corridor is expected to be used to
expedite the widening work.

The efforts made for the revival of
the Gola elephant corridor spanning from the Yamuna to Sharda on the
Tanakpur-Nepal border, which was in the news for all the wrong reasons,
may take a backseat if the proposal for widening of this road goes
through.

The increasing number of incidents of human-animal
conflict such as damaging of standing crop by jumbos in Lalkuwa area
tells the sorry story of the corridor. So the widening of road would
not only give rise to vehicular movement but also occupy a huge part of
forest land in this area resulting in its further deterioration.

Three
forest divisions, including Haldwani, Terai East and Terai Central, are
expected to be affected most following this road widening.

Only
Terai East forest division is expected to lose about seven hectares of
its forest land. The widening of road is still in the initial stages.
The approval of authorities, including the State forest department, has
been sought, PK Patro, divisional forest officer, Terai East forest
division, told The Pioneer.

The traditional Gola elephant
corridor seems to be defunct as there is almost no wildlife movement
here mainly because of human habitation along the area. Apart from
increasing vehicular movement and commercial activity, coming up of an
ITBP camp and an Indian Oil depot and rise in mining activities in the
area have added to the woes of the local wildlife.
