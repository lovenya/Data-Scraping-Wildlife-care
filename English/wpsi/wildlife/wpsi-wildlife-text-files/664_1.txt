MP
not keen to sign pact for tiger conservation


ZEE NEWS, 20th August, 2009

New
Delhi: Madhya Pradesh has expressed reservation over signing of a
tripartite pact with the centre for tiger conservation despite the
state facing flak for several deaths of the big cats in its Panna and
Kanha reserves.

The state officials are particularly worried
over a clause in the pact that make directors of tiger reserves
accountable for any lapses in the park.

"When already a
bilateral agreement with the Centre and the State exists why to drag
the director in the matter regarding tiger conservation. The funds are
being doled out to the states and not to the director.

"And what
if the director is shifted in between his term period," Prashant Mehta,
Additional Chief Secretary (Forests) of Madhya Pradesh, asked Union
Minister Jairarm Ramesh at a national conference on forests ministers
here.

The issue came up during the deliberation when Ramesh
called upon states to expedite signing of tripartite agreement which
aims to make the stakeholders including director of the reserve
responsible for protection of the big cat.

The agreement is a
move to boost tiger conservation as it make three parties --
Environment Ministry on behalf of the Centre, state government and the
tiger reserve -- accountable for their actions in protection of the big
cats which are on the verge of extinction due to various reasons.

Refusing
to buy the theory of the state government, Ramesh asked the National
Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) member secretary Rajesh Gopal to
hold a meeting with the state officials to encourage them to sign the
pact.newslink
