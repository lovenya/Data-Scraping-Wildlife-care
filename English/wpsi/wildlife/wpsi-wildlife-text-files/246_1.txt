Indo-Nepal Border Road rides roughshod on Uttar Pradesh wildlife habitat

 

7th May 2019

Development projects across the country continue to disturb natural habitats, ecosystems and wildlife, leaving areas vulnerable.

Tiger
reserves and wildlife sanctuaries  are under threat along the
upcoming 1,715-kilometres long Indo-Nepal Border Road that aims to
connect 154 border outposts of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), India’s armed
border force, across seven border districts (Pilibhit, Lakhimpur Kheri,
Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar and Maharajganj) in the
northern state of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.). The two-lane strategic road,
which is now under construction at different stretches, will largely
run parallel to the borders connecting the outposts to boost their
mobility in difficult terrain like hills, rivers and forests, while
keeping vigil.

However, of the 574 kilometres of the Uttar
Pradesh stretch of this ambitious project, 302 kilometres falls under
forest land, two tiger reserves (Pilibhit, Dudhwa) and three wildlife
sanctuaries (Suhelwa, Katarniaghat and Sohagi Barwa). While the state
public works department (PWD) is laying the first phase of 237
kilometres in low lying areas, the state forest department has raised
red flags over the second phase, opposing the passage of the road
through the protected Terai region, which has rich habitats of diverse
flora and fauna.
