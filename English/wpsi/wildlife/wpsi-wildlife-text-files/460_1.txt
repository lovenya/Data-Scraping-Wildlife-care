Leopard Poaching and 
                        Seizure 
                        
                        29th May, 2003
                        There are definite 
                          indications that the leopard is facing an increased 
                          threat from the skin trade. As many as 98 leopards have 
                          been lost to poaching in India in the last five months 
                          alone! 
                        WPSI personnel assisted 
                          the Haryana Police at Samalkha with the interrogation 
                          of the men arrested on 22 May with 7 leopard skins and 
                          18 otter skins. The 
                          traders said that the skins had been obtained from Uttaranchal 
                          and were to be taken to Delhi. The arrested men also 
                          said that they knew some of the 16 poachers who were 
                          arrested last year in connection with leopard and bear 
                          poaching in the State of Andhra Pradesh in South India 
                          last year. Some of these poachers were from Samalkha, 
                          while the others were from Katni in Madhyra Pradesh.
                        It is clear that poaching is now being 
                          co-ordinated on a national scale.
