Security forces personnel cannot ignore wildlife crime while on security job: judge

 

16 May 2022Security
forces personnel cannot ignore wildlife crime even though their
principal duty is to ensure security of the area they are deployed in,
the officiating Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court has said.

A
Sashastra Seema Bal jawan posted on the frontier cannot overlook any
attempt to smuggle out precious wildlife or wildlife parts from the
country even though his or her principal duty is to guard the frontier.

“Same
is the case with the Army and other paramilitary forces who are
expected to play a contributory role in helping forest and police
personnel in preventing wildlife crimes,” Justice N. Kotiswar Singh
said.

This was because the fundamental duties as enshrined in
the Constitution of India required all the citizens to protect the
natural environment, forest, water bodies and wildlife, he added.
