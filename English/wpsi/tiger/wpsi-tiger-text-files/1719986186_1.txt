Tiger poaching near Nagpur confirmed
 
Express news service Posted online: Tue Jan 22 2013Nagpur
: The Forest department has arrested seven people for poaching a big
cat, whose carcass was found in the Deolapar range of Nagpur
Territorial Forest last week, near Pench Tiger Reserve and recovered
parts from them.

The arrest was made early Sunday morning.

Further exposing the laxity of the department, it was revealed that the tiger was killed around Diwali last year.

This
means nobody, including senior officers, patrolled the area barely 300
metres from a national highway the past three months.

A forest guard and a labourer were suspended for dereliction of duty.

Post-mortem revealed the tiger was probably electrocuted.

“The arrested persons have admitted poaching,” divisional forest officer P K Mahajan said.

While
four persons were arrested from two villages near the place where the
carcass was found, three were arrested from Tumsar tehsil 80 km away.

The seizure included 12 claws, skull and rib-cage bones.

“They
(poachers) said they put wire to kill wild pigs. When they found the
tiger dead, they kept off the place only to return a few days later to
remove some parts,” Mahajan said.
