First release them in Phen sanctuary, says NTCA
In
a major setback to the State I Forest Department plans of translocating
two Kanha tigresses to the Panna Tiger Reserve, the National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA) has said that the two striped felines
should be released in the core area of the Phen sanctuary, before
considering their relocation to Panna.

In a letter to Chief Wild
Life Warden (CWLW) Madhya Pradesh, HS Pabla, the NTCA Deputy Inspector
General SP Yadav has said that it would be appropriate to initially
release the two-orphaned tigresses in the micro core area at Phen with
radio telemetry monitoring.
Significantly the sanctuary is situated in the vicinity of the Kanha Tiger Reserve.

Yadav
directed that the tigresses could be moved to Phen after due permission
from the competent authority. "After their wilding, these felines may
be considered for translocation to the Panna Tiger Reserve, ” he
advised.

The NTCA directives are likely to enthuse wildlife
activists who have long been questioning the translocation endeavours
of the Forest Department, and also the methodology of the process.
