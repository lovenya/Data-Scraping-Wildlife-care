Indian villagers beat tiger to death after attacks on locals 

 

26 July 2019



Indian police have arrested four people after a mob of villagers brutally beat to death a tiger that had attacked local people.

Mobile
phone footage of the incident went viral on social media, and officials
said one of nine people injured by the animal earlier had died in
hospital.

It is the latest in a growing number of animal-human
encounters in India, which experts blame on shrinking habitats and food
shortages for wildlife.

The tiger attacked people after straying
out of the Pilibhit tiger reserve in the northern state of Uttar
Pradesh, district magistrate Vaibhav Srivastava told AFP.

Dozens
of armed people surrounded the animal after it entered their village,
chased it and bludgeoned it to death with wooden batons and spears, he
said.

Thirty-three people were wanted over the killing of the
tiger and four had been arrested so far, the magistrate added, saying
the villagers were scared and angry after the attacks on humans.
