JORHAT:
An adult tigress was killed at Assam's Kaziranga National Park by an
automatic gun. An autopsy conducted on Tuesday found 15 bullets from
AK-47 rifles in the animal's body. The tigress was shot when it tried
to attack people near the Kohora forest range Monday morning.

Park
authorities said the tigress was killed by armed police. The police,
however, denied saying the animal was killed when forest guards fired
to save the lives of locals. The park authorities and National Tiger
Conservation Authority of India have begun two separate inquiries into
the killing.
