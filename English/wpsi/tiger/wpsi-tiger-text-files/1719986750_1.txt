Nagpur: The
detection of two jaw traps used to poach tigers and leopards falling
into it has revived decade-old memories of tiger poaching by organized
gangs from the Baheliya community from Katni in Madhya Pradesh (MP).In
the last four days, two leopards were caught in these traps in the
state. In the first case, a nine-year-old leopard was caught in a jaw
trap in Kakad Shivni (Karanja Lad) on the farm owned by Prakash Kadam
on February 4. The leopard was freed from the trap after being
tranquilized and was shifted to the rescue centre in Paratwada, where
it has recovered and will be reunited with its natural habitat soon.

In
a similar incident on Tuesday, a one-year-old leopard was caught in a
jaw trap in Khodshi, Karad, in western Maharashtra. The sub-adult
animal was rescued by a forest team and the jaw trap was removed but
its paw has been badly damaged due to deep wounds.
