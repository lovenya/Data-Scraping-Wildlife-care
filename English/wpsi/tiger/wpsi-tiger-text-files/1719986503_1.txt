UK MPs call on governments worldwide for urgent action to end killing of big cats

Today
in Westminster, MPs have called for urgent action to end the killing of
tigers and other big cats by halting trade in their parts and products.

At
an event co-hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary China Group and the
Indo-British All-Party Parliamentary Group, along with our Wildlife
campaigners, MPs expressed serious concern over the existential crisis
facing the world’s tigers and other big cats from killing to meet
demand for body parts.

Fewer than 4,000 wild tigers survive and
the species has already been hunted and traded to extinction across
much of its natural range, particularly in South-East Asia and China.
Asia’s leopards have disappeared from 85 per cent of their historic

leopards have been killed for trade since 2000 – the true total is
likely many times higher.
