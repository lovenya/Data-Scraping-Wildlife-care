K.M. Chinnappa, 84, who was
synonymous with Nagarahole and wildlife protection, passed away at his
residence in Kumatoor village in Srimangala, Kodagu district of
Karnataka, on February 26.

                        

A former Forest Department official, he was instrumental in ensuring
protection to Nagarahole, fending off pressure from timber mafia and
local politicians when the forest was still a wildlife sanctuary and
had not yet received the status of a tiger reserve.

                        

Consequent to protection in the early days through 1960s to ‘80s, the
prey density and the carnivore population number in Nagarahole
increased as did the number of Chinnappa’s detractors from whom he
constantly suffered harassment, forcing him to opt for a voluntary
retirement in 1992-93.
