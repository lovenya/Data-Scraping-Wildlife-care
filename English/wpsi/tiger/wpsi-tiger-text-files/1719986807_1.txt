Nagpur: A male tiger from Tadoba
landscape in Bramhapuri travelled around 2,000km to reach Odisha
crossing forests in four states in search of a safe territory and a
mate.

Generally, the forest departments come to know about such dispersals
when tigers are radio-collared but the one from Bramhapuri in Vidarbha
was not radio-collared and was identified from its stripes pattern.

                        

This may perhaps be the second-longest tiger dispersal in the country.
It must have crossed many hurdles including water bodies, riverine,
mines, agricultural fields, roads, and human habitats. Yet, there is no
record of the animal attacking humans.
                        Though
Odisha has been reporting the dispersal of tigers from neighbouring
Chhattisgarh, this is the first time a big cat has reached the eastern
state from Vidarbha.
