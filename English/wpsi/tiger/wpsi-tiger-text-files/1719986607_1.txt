A
Maharashtra forest department staff has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh
for allegedly dumping the carcass of a tigress in the forest here, an
official said on Saturday.

The carcass of tigress Sharmili,
officially tagged as T-19, was found on December 11 in Khawasa forest
range of Seoni district, the official said.

"A suraksha shramik
(security staff) identified as Dhamsingh Khandate (38) was arrested on
Friday. He works in Maharashtra's Karwai forest area under Devlapur
range," said Chief Conservator of Forests (Seoni) RS Kori.

"Khandate
has told us he dumped the carcass with the help of one Laxman Tekam of
Karwai village on directives of a deputy ranger of the Maharashtra
forest department on December 10. They bought the carcass on a
bullock-cart," Kori said.

He said the bullock-cart wheel marks
at the spot where the tigress was found aroused suspicion, adding that
Khandate was placed under arrest after he confessed to the crime during
interrogation.
