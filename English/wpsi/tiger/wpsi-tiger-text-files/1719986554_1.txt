The
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has confirmed the presence
of tigers in high-altitude areas of Sikkim, Uttarakhand, West Bengal
and Arunachal Pradesh in a study submitted to the environment ministry.

Camera
trapping has shown tiger presence in Kedarnath at about 3,600 metres
above sea level. In Sikkim also their presence has been confirmed at
about 3,300 metres above sea level.

“We now have concrete
evidence that tigers are present in high altitude areas of all four
states. The study was to understand tiger presence in high altitude
regions of Nepal, Bhutan and India. In all three regions tigers are
there in the higher reaches. We are not sure if they reside there or
are moving from other places. That will be verified in the second part
of our study,” said Nishant Verma,deputy inspector general, NTCA and
nodal officer of the project.

The team has studied secondary data, conducted interviews with local people and used camera traps to ascertain tiger presence.
