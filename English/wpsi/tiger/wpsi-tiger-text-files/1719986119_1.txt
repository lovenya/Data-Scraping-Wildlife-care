Nagpur, Sat Feb 25 2012Suddenly
waking up to its dubious distinction as the state with the maximum
reported cases of wildlife crime, senior Maharashtra Forest officials
have been summoned to devise a concerted strategy to decisively curb
the menace.

The officials have had a few rounds of meetings over
the past few days to discuss the problem and possible solutions. A
meeting of the regional Tiger Cell, a joint Forest-Police forum that is
supposed to tackle wildlife crime, was also held here recently.

“We
have sought wildlife crime data from Wildlife Protection Society of
India (WPSI) and are analysing it. The attempt is to check the pending
cases and the reasons why they have not gone to the logical end of
conviction or why they have been lingering,” Principal Secretary
(Forest) Pravin Pardeshi told The Indian Express.

Pardeshi said,
“apart from taking the pending cases to their logical end and get
convictions to deter the criminals involved, our endeavour will be to
prevent poaching instead of later going after the poachers.”
