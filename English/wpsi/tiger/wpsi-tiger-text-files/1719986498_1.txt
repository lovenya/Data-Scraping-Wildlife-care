Tarafdar, a middle-aged woman, was dragged away by a tiger in Pirkhali
in the core area of the Sundarbans, where she had gone to catch crabs
on Monday.

Three other women who had accompanied Tarafdar on a
boat, managed to return safely and informed the forest department and
police station about the incident.

“They had valid permission
for going into the forest area to catch fish. We are conducting
searches for the woman who was taken away by the tiger,” said Tripti
Saha, divisional forest officer (south) in South 24 Parganas district.

According
to the local people, 50-year-old Banalata, who is a resident of Gosaba
area, about 87 km to the south of Kolkata, was on a boat when a tiger
suddenly attacked the boat. Though the three somehow managed to jump
into the river, the tiger caught hold of Tarafdar and dragged her away.

“Those
who accompanied my wife told me that a tiger dragged her away from the
boat,” Gour Tarafdar, the husband of the victim said.

Incidentally,
Tarafdar is the eighth person to be taken away by a tiger in the
Sundarbans since December 2018. They had ventured into the core area of
the forest either to catch fish and crabs or collect honey.
