50% of disappearances in illegal mining zones

 

19 Nov 2021

The Kundera
and Talada ranges in Rajasthan’s Ranthambore Tiger Reserve accounted
for half the 12 tigers gone missing since last year, wildlife watchers
and forest department officials said on Thursday. There is no sign of
the tigers till now.

Although forest department officials blamed
congestion at one of the country’s most crowded reserves, and
territorial fights caused by it, wildlife activists said the tigers
disappeared from the two zones where illegal mining and human-animal
conflict were high. Officials said six of the 12 tigers went missing
between January 2020 and March 2021 from the Kundera and Talada ranges,
spread across 125 sq km. 

Conservation biologist Dharmendra
Khandal said a considerable number of tigers going missing from a
specific area indicates abnormal activity. “Infighting for territory
cannot happen at only one place in the reserve.”

He added that
the number of tigers that went missing has been highest in 18 years,
and that too from specific parts of the reserve.
