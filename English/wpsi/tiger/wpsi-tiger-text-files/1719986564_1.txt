On
September 12, The Indian Express shared the findings of its
investigation with the three lead authors of the all-India tiger
estimation reports Y V Jhala and Qamar Qureshi of the Wildlife
Institute of India (WII) and Rajesh Gopal of the Global Tiger Forum
(GTF); and with Anup Kumar Nayak, chief of the National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA), seeking their comments on the
discrepancies found.

Six days later, on September 18, the WII
uploaded a modified photo album on its website with a corrigendum. It
read: “The original 2014 tiger photo album had a few errors that were
due to typos and pasting of the same photos in multiple places. These
errors had crept in during copy-editing by the printer and have now
been rectified in the uploaded corrigendum album for all camera trap
photos obtained by the forest department of states and WII.”
