Satkosia Tiger Reserve no good, send Sundari to Kanha: Madhya Pradesh HC

ANGUL/BHUBANESWAR:
Once wild and carefree, Sundari spent an agonizing two years of
captivity in an enclosure at Satkosia Tiger Reserve, which she was
supposed to make her new home, far away from Madhya Pradesh. However,
the tigress would soon return where she belonged after Madhya Pradesh
High Court directed that the big cat be withdrawn from Satkosia and
shifted to Kanha Tiger Reserve.

Disposing of a writ petition on
rewilding of Sundari, the Jabalpur bench of Madhya Pradesh HC
comprising acting Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Vijay Kumar
Shukla upheld the order of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)
to shift the animal from its enclosure at Raigoda in Satkosia to
Ghorela centre inside Kanha TR in MP.

Taking note of NTCA’s
assessment report on the tiger re-introduction programme at Satkosia,
the Madhya Pradesh HC ruled that the tigress (identified as T-2) cannot
be allowed to be kept in a small enclosure for a longer time.
