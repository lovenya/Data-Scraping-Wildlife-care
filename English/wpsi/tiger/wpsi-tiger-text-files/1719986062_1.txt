20% increase in tiger population

NEW DELHI, July 29, 2011

India
registered a 20 per cent increase in tiger population last year, says a
report, ‘Status of tigers, co-predators and prey in India-2010,'
released here on Thursday by Jagdish Kishwan, Additional
Director-General (Wildlife), Ministry of Environment and Forests.

“The
estimated population of 1, 706 individual tigers represents a 20 per
cent increase from the last survey in 2006, which estimated a number of
1,411 tigers. The increase is based on the survey of additional areas
as well as an increase in the number of tigers within high-density
populations,'' the report said.

The assessment of tigers,
co-predators and prey included 17 States with tiger population and
involved 4, 77, 000 work-days by forest staff and 37, 000 work-days by
professional biologists, making it the largest exercise of its kind in
the world.

It is done once every four years and is a
collaborative initiative between the National Tiger Conservation
Authority, the Wildlife Institute of India, tiger States and outside
expertise.

“The increase in the numbers is due to the fact that
tiger populations in Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka
have shown an increase in their density. The inclusion of Sunderbans,
some portions of the North-East and parts of Maharashtra have also
contributed to the increase and the methodology consisted of a double
sampling approach,” noted Mr. Kishwan.

But despite the good
news, the report warns that tigers are still in danger due to an
overall 12.6 per cent loss of habitat, which means that more tigers are
being squeezed into smaller areas, which could lead to a lack of
dispersal and consequent loss of genetic exchange between populations,
and an increase in human-tiger conflict.
