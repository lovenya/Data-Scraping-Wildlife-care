Special units for tigers, wildlife crime face axe in MoEF revamp 

 

10 May 2020



A
proposal from “various VIPs” in Himachal Pradesh last year to change
the jurisdiction of the Dehradun regional office of the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to Chandigarh has
triggered a massive restructuring plan.

The reorganisation plan
entails merging the 10 regional offices of the MoEF&CC and 19
centres of the Forest Survey of India (FSI), National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA), Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and
Central Zoo Authority (CZA) into just 19 regional offices of the
Ministry.

The stated objective of merging regional offices with
the NTCA, WCCB, CZA and FSI centres is improving efficiency and
ensuring better coordination.
