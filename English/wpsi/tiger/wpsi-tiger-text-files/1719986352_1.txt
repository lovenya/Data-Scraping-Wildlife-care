Tiger
crushed to death by earthmover used by forest officials to trap it

 


26th March, 2017



A
three-member committee of the National Tiger Conservation Authority
(NTCA) and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) has confirmed that an
eight-year-old tiger, which killed two persons, died after being
crushed by an earthmover.



An inquiry report will be submitted to the NTCA chief soon.



On
March 16, the forest department deployed an earthmover to block the
movement of the tiger that had already been tranquilised. The rescue
operation went on for almost nine hours. However, the animal died the
same night.



A video posted on social media by an eyewitness,
which showed the animal being hit by the earthmover, spurred the NTCA
to order an inquiry. Two deputy inspector generals of the authority –
Nishant Verma and Sanjay Kumar – and bureau deputy director RS Thakur
reached Ramnagar on March 21.
