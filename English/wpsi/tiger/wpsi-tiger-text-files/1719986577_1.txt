Madhya
Pradesh has recorded the highest number of tiger deaths in five years,
11 in the first 10 months of a year, according to state forest
department officials.

The deaths have alarmed forest officials.
This year, MP re-emerged as the state with the highest number of tigers
in the country after eight years. According to the 2018 All India Tiger
Estimation report released in July, MP has 526 tigers followed by
Karnataka (524). Officials said that the report has boosted tourism in
the state .

The latest big cat death was reported from MP’s
Vindhya region, where villagers allegedly poisoned a tigress near
Sanjay Tiger Reserve after blaming it for attacking their cattle. The
carcass of T-20, the tigress, was found on October 28 and seven
villagers were arrested for the killing, a forest department official
said on condition of anonymity.

A second forest department
official, who too spoke on condition of anonymity, said that of the 11,
at least nine tigers and tigresses were poached, electrocuted or
poisoned in 2019.
