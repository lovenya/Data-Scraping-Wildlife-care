DEHRADUN:
India lost over 100 tigers in 2020 due to various causes ranging from
territorial fights, poaching, road mishaps and natural reasons.
According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the apex
body formed by the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) to keep a
check on the status of big cats in the country, the number of tigers
killed last year was 106 while the Wildlife Protection Society of India
(WPSI), an NGO working to combat poaching and illicit trade in wild
animals, pegs the number at 109.

The slight discrepancy in the
numbers, experts say, arises from the fact that scientifically, it’s
difficult to pinpoint the exact number of tiger deaths. “In the wild,
the carcass of tigers can get decomposed, and sometimes they are eaten
up by scavengers, too, so it is difficult to know exact tiger deaths
considering the huge landscape they live in,” said Y V Jhala, senior
scientist, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun.
