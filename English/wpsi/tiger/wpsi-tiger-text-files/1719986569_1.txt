DECLARED the Tiger State of India, Madhya Pradesh is inching closer to
getting its seventh tiger reserve — the Ratapani Tiger Reserve.

A
committee set up by the state government to finalise contours of the
core and buffer areas of the proposed reserve, to be carved out of the
Ratapani wildlife sanctuary, has submitted its report. The proposed
reserve has been hanging fire for more than a decade.

Of the
823.065 sq km area of the existing sanctuary, 763.812 sq km has been
redrawn as the core and the remaining 59.253 sq km will be the buffer
area of the proposed reserve. Out of the 29 revenue villages that were
part of the sanctuary, nine villages, spread over 26.947 sq km, fall in
the reserve’s core area.
