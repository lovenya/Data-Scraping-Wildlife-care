NAGPUR:
A latest study by three wildlife scientists has identified 567 types of
barriers in 30 corridors in Central India landscape consisting of
3,84,508 sqkm spread across 16 protected areas (PAs) in Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. It contains 16 PAs with a size of 87 sqkm
to 3,188 sqkm.

Central India is a global-priority landscape for
tiger conservation and contains about 31% of India’s tiger population.
The study mapped these corridors and ranked them according to their
restoration potential.

“We associated barriers with
infrastructure to show where mitigation measures can be targeted. We
mapped 567 barriers within 30 linkages in this landscape of which 265
barriers intersect with infrastructure and include 694km of roads,
150km of railway, 48 reservoirs, and 10 mines. Besides, 302 barriers
are due to land-use or gaps in forest cover,” says lead author of the
study Trishna Dutta, Department of Ecology, Evolution, &
Environmental Biology, Columbia University, New York.
