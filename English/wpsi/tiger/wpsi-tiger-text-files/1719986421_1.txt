GUWAHATI: A three-year camera trap study has reported the presence
of tigers in the snow-clad Dibang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh at the
height of 3,630 metres.

It might be the highest spot at which
the big cats have been sighted, but Aisho Sharma Adhikarimayum - a
Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientist - believes that they may be
present in even higher reaches of the mountains.

Adhikarimayum
of the WII's department of endangered species management said there was
a possibility that the predators were present beyond 3,630 metres in
the valley, like in Bhutan, where a tiger was photographed at 4,200
metres in 2012. He was backed by conservationist Anwaruddin Choudhury,
the author of several reports on the wildlife of Dibang Valley.
Choudhury told TOI there was a distinct chance of tigers being present
in the landscape up to a height of 4,000 metres
