NAGPUR:
Investigators probing the poaching case have learnt notorious poacher
Rahul Gulabsingh Gondthakur (Kuttu) alias Kuttu Chhiyalal Pardhi killed
five tigers and not three as previously believed. One of the two more
tigers killed is suspected to have been poached in Gaikhori near
Umarzari and another in Wadsa in Gadchiroli.

Earlier, Kuttu had
claimed to have killed three tigers Â­ one in Seoni near Ramtek and
Paoni and Gaimukh in Bhandara divisions. However, wildlife experts say
35-year-old Kuttu's is the second generation of poachers that must have
removed many more tigers from the region in the past 20 years.

Kuttu
and his accomplices had laid four steel traps in compartment number 138
(Sawri Nullah) and 146 (Bhandara Road) on May 3, 2007. These areas,
which were part of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM)
then, are now under New Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary.

FDCM had
seized the trap and registered an offence but did little to track the
culprits and hence the offence was compounded. Now when the accused has
been nabbed, it is not keen on investigating the matter as the area has
been handed over to wildlife.
