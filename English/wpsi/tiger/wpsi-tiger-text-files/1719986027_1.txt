Leopard
pelts, big cat bones, ivory and firearms were seized from six wildlife
poachers arrested in an operation conducted jointly by Uttarakhand
forest department officials with police.



According to the
Uttarakhand Forest and Environment Advisory Committee vice-chairman
Anil Baluni, these poachers were active in Corbett and Rajaji national
parks. One of them confessed to supplying one tiger skin and bones of
three tigers to a man in Dharchula during the previous year. Wildlife
activists said the arrests point to unabated poaching activity in the
two national park territories. According to Baluni, based on
Intelligence reports, the State authorities have been monitoring the
movements of these men for the past two months.



The arrested
include Balku Bawaria, Gami Gujjar, Ali Jaan and Ramesh, who are
habitual offenders. They live in villages near the national park
territories. Gujjar, who passed the tiger skin and bones of the big cat
to a man in Dharchula, hails from a village in Kalagarh Tiger Reserve.
The authorities are now interrogating the men and hope to uncover a
nationwide nexus of wildlife poachers and smugglers based on the
extracted information. The information will also be provided to the
National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Baluni said.
