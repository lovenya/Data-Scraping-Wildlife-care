Tiger’s 1,300-km walk over six months strains population theory

 

2 Dec 2019



In
what may be the longest trek by a tiger in India, a sub-adult of the
species reached Dnyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary in Buldhana district of
Maharashtra on Sunday, walking 1,300 km over six months, from Tipeshwar
Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal district.

What intrigues
conservationists is that T1C1 appears to not have stopped anywhere for
more than four-five days, and that too only when he made a kill, mostly
of cattle. Maharashtra Chief Wildlife Warden Nitin Kakodkar said the
tiger didn’t travel in a linear fashion but moved back and fourth
several times, over farmlands, water bodies and highways, thus adding
hundreds of kilometres to its journey.

While experts think the
pattern shows search for a mate, they believe it also indicates that
the tiger protection policy needs to be recalibrated.

Wildlife
scientists and managers generally follow the popular “source and sink”
population theory of a decade ago — it was believed that beyond the
protected core tiger areas or source populations, a dispersing tiger
population was bound to be a “sink” population, or not guaranteed to
survive.
