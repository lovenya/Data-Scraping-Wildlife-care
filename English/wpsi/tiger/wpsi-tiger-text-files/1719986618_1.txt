A
male tiger from Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal district of
Vidarbha has set a record by covering over 3,000 km before settling
down in the Dnyanganga Wildlife Sanctuary in Buldana district.

Identified
by wildlife officials as T1C1, the tiger’s marathon trek included
several back and forth journeys from Tipeshwar to neighbouring Adilabad
forest in Telangana and also to Painganga Sanctuary, and from
Dnyanganga to Ajanta hills in Aurangabad.

“He has till date
covered 3,020 km and has more or less settled down in Dnyanganga over
the past about three months,” Principal Chief Conservator of Forest
(Wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar told The Indian Express.
