MP govt writes to Centre seeking change in industrial corridor route

 

11 July 2022The
Madhya Pradesh government has urged the Centre to change the proposed
fastest route for the Delhi-Nagpur Industrial Corridor with a longer
one to save the forests of Pench Tiger Reserve and Nauradehi Wildlife
Sanctuary in the state, people familiar with the development said.

Earlier,
agencies appointed by the National Industrial Development Corporation
(NIDC) proposed a 1,080-km fastest route between Delhi and Nagpur for
industrial corridor, but it passes through Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary
— the largest wildlife sanctuary of Madhya Pradesh located between
Sagar and Narsinghpur districts — and Pench Tiger Reserve between Seoni
and Nagpur districts.
