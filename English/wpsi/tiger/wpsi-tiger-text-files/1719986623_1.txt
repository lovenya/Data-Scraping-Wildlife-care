Tiger sightings increase in the Sunderban with lockdown but no tourists to see them 

 

13 April 2020



With
no hustle and bustle of tourists because of the pan-India coronavirus
lockdown, tiger sightings in the Sunderbans – the only mangrove forest
where tigers live – have increased in the delta, forest officials said.

“Before
the lockdown, when tourists were allowed, we used to get reports of
tiger sightings on not more than two days in a week. But since the
lockdown started, patrolling teams are spotting tigers almost five to
six days every week. On some days, reports of multiple tiger sightings
from different areas of the tiger reserve are also coming from the
forest guards,” said Sudhir Das, director of the Sunderban Tiger
Reserve.

Even though there are around 90 tigers living in the
Indian part of the Sunderban, that spreads over 4200 sq km, the
impenetrable forest makes it almost impossible to spot tigers.
