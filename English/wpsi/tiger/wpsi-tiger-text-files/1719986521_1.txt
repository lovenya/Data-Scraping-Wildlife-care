Ban development in tiger habitats, advises conservation body

 

31 July 2019



With
the number of tigers in India doubling between 2006 and 2018 to 2,967,
the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has asked that core
and critical tiger habitats be declared inviolate spaces where no
infrastructure development or mining can be allowed, and that tiger
corridors be carefully interlinked.

Mining and linear projects
pose a threat to both tiger corridors and habitat. “Linear projects
such as roads are a major problem in maintaining corridors. Mining
affects the tiger habitat, particularly in the central India
landscape,” said YV Jhala, scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India.

According
to Rajesh Gopal, former head of NTCA, India’s mineral map shows that
most states rich in tigers are also rich in minerals.
