22 Mar 2022BHOPAL/JABALPUR:
Madhya Pradesh lost yet another tiger to the lust for game meat in
Balaghat district. The carcass of a tiger was found in a nullah near
Ratta village on Sunday night. It was electrocuted, say wildlife
officials.
A forest team went to the site with a sniffer dog.
Investigations revealed that four men, aged 20 to 25 years, had laid an
electric wire trap to poach deer, but the tiger walked into it. The
trap was connected to an 11KV line, and the tiger was killed instantly.

The
youths got scared when they saw the dead tiger and decided to dump the
carcass in a nullah near their village, say officers. Police nabbed the
four accused — Mithun Parte, Sunil Uikey, Ankesh Mandavi and Tejpal
Mandavi — and booked them under Wildlife Act. The carcass was disposed
of in compliance with National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)
protocol after preserving samples for forensic examination.
