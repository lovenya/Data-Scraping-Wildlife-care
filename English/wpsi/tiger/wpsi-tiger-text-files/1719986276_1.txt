Tigers
in Uttar Pradesh are falling prey to pesticides. Five big cats were
found dead in different parts of Pilibhit and Lakhimpur Kheri forests
between May 2012 and April 2015. Samples of their carcasses tested
positive for organochlorene pesticides, including DDT.

“Organochlorene
pesticide, especially DDT, was found in the viscera of all the five
tigers brought here for tests between May 2012 and April 2015. The
tigers consumed the pesticides that led to their death,” said sources
at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI).

However,
there is still no clarity on how the pesticides reached the tigers.
Unconfirmed reports say tantriks may be using pesticides to kill tigers
to get whiskers of the dead animal to use in occult practices.

Dheeraj
Pathak, rescue chief of People For Animals (PFA) in the region, said
tantriks may be involved in the deadly act of using pesticides to
eliminate tigers for acquiring their body parts. They mainly want
whiskers and nails of tigers, Pathak said, adding that tantriks
reportedly use these parts in occult practices. “Presence of DDT in
viscera of the dead tigers shows that their enemies are active around
the forests,” he said.

The tiger that was found dead in south
Phardhan area of south Kheri forest division on December 9, 2014, had
also fallen prey to the pesticide, revealed the viscera test. A nail
each of its forelimbs and part of the moustaches and jaws were missing
from its carcass.
