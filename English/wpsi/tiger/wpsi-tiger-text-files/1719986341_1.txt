Surge in seizures of captive-bred tigers strengthens call for Asia to close all tiger farms

 

15th Nov., 2016



With commercial tiger breeding in Asia threatening the future
of the world’s remaining wild tigers, governments must announce
concrete steps to close all the continent’s tiger farms within the next
three years at the international conference on illegal wildlife trade
starting tomorrow in Viet Nam.

A full TRAFFIC report released
today on tiger trafficking found that an estimated 30 per cent of
tigers seized between 2012 and 2015 were reported to come from captive
breeding facilities, highlighting their growing role in the illegal
trade. While complicating enforcement activities, tiger farms also
legitimise the sale of tiger parts and products, which drives up demand.

“There
is no longer any doubt that tiger farms are stimulating and expanding
the illegal tiger trade or that they should all be closed down,” said
Michael Baltzer, Leader of WWF’s Tigers Alive Initiative. “The Hanoi
Conference is the perfect platform for governments to commit to
shutting Asia’s tiger farms, which would contribute enormously to the
survival and recovery of tigers in the wild.”
