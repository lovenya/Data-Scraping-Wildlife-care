Tiger breeding zones in Corbett hit by ‘illegal construction’, Delhi HC seeks NTCA report

 

24 Aug 2021

Dehradun:
Two walls on two 5-km stretches and 12 bridges are allegedly being
built illegally within the Corbett Tiger Reserve. The Delhi high court
on Monday asked the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to
file a report in response to a petition that says this illegal
construction “by forest officials” is threatening the breeding zones of
tigers.

A source told TOI that so far, a seven-foot wall on a
5-km stretch from Saneh to Pakhro, another on a 5-km route from
Morghati to Kalagarh, and 12 bridges being built illegally on a 17-km
stretch of the Corbett Tiger Reserve between Kalagarh and Pakhro have
been identified. Barring cement, construction material is also being
sourced from the forests, “resulting in illegal mining of natural
resources,” a notice to the NTCA from the petitioner, 
Uttarakhand-based lawyer Gaurav Bansal, said.
