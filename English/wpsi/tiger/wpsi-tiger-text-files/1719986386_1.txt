Primacy to tourism affecting tiger habitats: Centre to Rajasthan govt


 
22nd April, 2018


Citing
cases of disappearance of tigers in Rajasthan, the Centre has alleged
that tourism has assumed primacy in the state over basic ecological
tenets resulting in dispersal of the big cats.

Further, in spite
of capacity building of frontline forest personnel, monitoring was not
up to the mark and periodically tigers were reported missing, it said.

“Even
today, it has been reported that tiger ST-5 is missing and ST-11 was
reported dead in spite of intensive monitoring,” Union Environment,
Forest and Climate Change Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a recent
letter to Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje.

In the
letter, he said a two-phased project titled monitoring of re-introduced
tigers in the Sariska Tiger Reserve was instituted in joint
collaboration with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA),
the Wildlife Institute of india (WII) and the state of Rajasthan.

The
project was designed with the overreaching objective of monitoring
re-introduced tigers and in process develop capacity of frontline
forest staff in state-of-the-art monitoring protocols, it said.
