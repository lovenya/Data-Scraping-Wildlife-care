BHOPAL: In a
major setback to Madhya Pradesh, a male radio-collared tiger on
dispersal from Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR) got killed in Satna district.

It was one among the two frequently spotted tiger siblings in PTR’s Akola range and popular among tourists as ‘Heera and Panna’.

Decomposed,
de-skinned carcass of Heera was found in the Singhpur range – around 70
km away from the Satna district headquarters on Sunday night. The area
where the carcass was found is close to PTR in the Vindhya landscape,
where the tigers are known to disperse.
Senior forest officials had
reached the spot after receiving the information. While officials
refused to comment, sources informed that it must have died due to
electric farm fencing and then deskinned.

Heera – coded as
P234-21 – and Panna had moved outside PTR on July 24. It was among the
three tigers radio-collared for satellite-based mapping of landscape
and dispersals by the state forest department and WII-Dehradun.
