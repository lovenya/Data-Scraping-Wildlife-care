Six
villagers have been arrested for allegedly killing a tiger whose highly
decomposed carcass was found in the Motinala buffer zone of Kanha Tiger
Reserve in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh, a forest officer said on
Saturday.

The six villagers of two villages - Manori and Bhamori
of the district laid an electric fence two weeks ago to catch a wild
boar but accidentally a tiger was trapped in it, said Anjana Suchita
Tirkey, deputy director, Kanha Tiger Reserve.

The villagers were arrested under the Wildlife Protection Act.

The accused also told the forest official that this was for the second time when they had laid an electric fence.

“Earlier,
they were successful in catching a wild boar. Two weeks ago, they laid
an electric fence and were visiting the spot daily to check the trap.
Last week when they came to see the trap, they saw a tiger died of
electrocution. They removed the fencing and threw the carcass of the
tiger near Motinala,” said Tirkey.
