Tigress, 2 cubs found dead near Tadoba reserve in Maharashtra

 

9 July 2019




A
tigress and her two cubs were found dead close to Tadoba Tiger Reserve
in Maharashtra’s Chandrapur district on Monday morning taking the death
toll of big cats in the reserve to 11 since January 2019.

The
tiger reserve has witnessed frightening human-animal conflict in recent
times, with a hunter killing elusive tigress Avni on November 5, 2018,
following sustained pressure from locals who claimed that the animal
has killed 11 persons around the reserve in a year before her death.
The activists claimed that she was killed in violation of the protocol.

The
number of tigers in the 1,700-square kilometre Tadoba-Andheri national
park, the biggest tiger reserve of Maharashtra, has more than doubled —
from 42 in 2014 to 88 in 2018 —bringing them in direct conflict with
local farmers, who accuse the endangered species of targeting them and
their cattle.
