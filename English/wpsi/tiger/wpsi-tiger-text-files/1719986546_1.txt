Over 3.44 lakh trees to be cut in Jharkhand’s Palamau Tiger Reserve

 

30 August 2019



With
the water resource department planning to begin the operation of
cutting over 3.44 lakh trees in Jharkhand’s Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR)
for North Koel project, also known as Mandal dam, wildlife experts have
raised an alarm button terming it a further damage to ‘tiger-less’
reserve.

As per the latest All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)
results, released on July 29, no tiger was recorded in the reserve
during the estimation.

The reservoir project threatens to submerge 3,44,644 trees in the reserve.

The
water resource department has already got the permission for felling of
the trees and it claimed to have deposited Rs 461 crore to the forest
department for the purpose. Since it falls in forest land, it requires
a formal NOC from the state forest department.

“We have sought
NOC from the forest department to begin several works including on
forest land,” said Mukesh Kumar, chief engineer of water resource
department, Daltonganj.
