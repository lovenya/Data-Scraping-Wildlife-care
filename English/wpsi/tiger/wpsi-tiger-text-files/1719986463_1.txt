Wire Snares: The Silent Stranglers

 

22nd May 2019

Nagpur:
Twenty-four tigers and 110 leopards choking to death in forests across
the country in the last nine years after getting entangled in wire
snares laid for herbivores seem to be just tip off the iceberg! There
may be scores of wild animals falling prey to this age-old technique of
poachers for bush meat, which is now threatening even tigers.

Though
little is being done by the forest departments to tackle menace of wire
snares laid by bush meat-hungry poachers, the issue has once again
hogged limelight after death of a young tigress on April 13, 2019,
inside country’s premium tiger reserve Tadoba in Chandrapur and
Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Yavatmal on March 19. The Tipeshwar
tigress moved with the trap for nearly 18 months and it must have been
agonizing.

Considered to be poaching cases, no forest department
in the country has figures about number of wild animal deaths
exclusively due to these body-gripping traps. However, a database by
Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), working to combat poaching
and escalating wildlife trade, has recorded 24 tiger and 110 leopard
deaths in the country during 2010-2018, which includes five tigers and
14 leopards in Maharashtra. Similarly, 57 leopards were injured and 30
other wild animals died painful death during the same period.
