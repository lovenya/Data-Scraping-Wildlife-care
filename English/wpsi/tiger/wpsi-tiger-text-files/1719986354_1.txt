35 Tigers Have Been Run Over By Trains In Madhya Pradesh In Last One Year

 

1st April 2017



Yet another tiger was run over by a train between Budhni and
Mid-Ghat area in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday morning.
Earlier, an adult tiger and a leopard were found dead under mysterious
circumstances at the same spot on February 23.

This is the
fourth tiger to have died in the state in the last two months, 35th
since 2016. The first one to have died was a tigress — coded T1 — found
near Sarvahi village in Shehdol district on January 21. Sources say
that a wrong chain-fencing around the mid-ghat railway track might be
causing frequent deaths at this spot.

Earlier in 2015, an adult
male tiger, hit by a speeding train at the same spot, had died due to
an undue delay on the part of the department's rescue team. The tiger
was found at the same place near the mid-ghat area of Sehore district.

Ratapani,
which recorded a population of eight breeding tigers in the area, has
not yet been notified as a tiger reserve despite an in-principle
approval from National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2008.
Ratapani is spread over 890 sqkm in the Bhopal-Raisen forest division.
