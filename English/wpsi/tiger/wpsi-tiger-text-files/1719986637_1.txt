‘Neutering, translocation of tigers are hare-brained ideas’

Nagpur:
Wildlife experts, veterinarians and wildlife buffs have termed the idea
of neutering tigers to stop procreation and preventing man-animal
conflict by the state government outlandish and hare-brained. They also
questioned the proposal to translocate 50 tigers from Chandrapur
district.

“It is usually not justified scientifically to
translocate wild tigers to new locations whatever be the reason. Only
if there is a sufficiently large site with abundant prey, some wild
tigers that have already acquired hunting skills can be relocated to
repopulate such an area. There has been only one successful large
project of this nature in Panna, where there was abundant wild prey,
villages had been relocated, and tigers had been poached out earlier.
All other cases of translocation have failed including the one in
Sariska to meet the intention of repopulating a new habitat with
tigers,” said K Ullas Karanth, director, Centre for Wildlife Studies
(CWS).
