22 Nov 2021

BHOPAL:
Madhya Pradesh high court on Monday issued notices to the state and
Central government along with national tiger conservation authority
(NTCA) seeking explanation on the death of 36 tigers in over a period
of 10 months this year. They have been asked to file their replies
within four weeks.

Tiger death toll has increased to 40 with
recovery of a damaged radio collar of a tigress T30 from near Singrauli
area on Saturday. This tigress was shifted from Bandhavgarh to Sanjay
National park. Poachers are yet to be arrested, say sources.

Notices
were issued by chief justice Ravi Malimath following a PIL by
environmentalist and RTI activist Ajay Dubey highlighting the issue. He
pointed out that even tigers having satellite radio collars are being
poached or falling prey to deadly traps outside protected areas due to
negligence of the forest department.
