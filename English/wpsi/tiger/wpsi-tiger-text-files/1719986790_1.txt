Wright, tiger conservationist and founder and executive director of the
Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), speaks to TOI on Project
Tiger completing 50 years and the challenges.
EXCERPTS:
¦ How do you see the country’s progress in tiger conservation in the past 50 years?
Can
you shed some light on the current wildlife scenario in India? I think
it is a miracle that in this day and age we still have forests where
tiger populations are doing so well. Much of this has to do with the
tiger’s resilience, and the long-standing tolerance of people who live
on the fringes of the tiger’s habitat, but it is also an extraordinary
conservation success story for which India should be very proud. There
are huge challenges ahead, and in particular the growing and festering
conflict between wildlife and people.
