Two
major private airlines have been found to be indulging in smuggling of
endangered species in the northeastern region, wildlife investigators
told environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Thursday. A huge consignment
of wildlife body parts, including that of tigers, was caught at
Guwahati airport recently while on its way for a foreign destination
through a passenger airlines. “Both cargo and passenger airlines are
being used for the smuggling,” said a senior official of National
Wildlife Crime Bureau. The source, however, refused to divulge the
names of the airlines. Ramesh
has now decided to ask civil aviation minister Vayalar Ravi to cancel
the licences of the airlines found to be allowing smuggling of
endangered species, especially from the north-eastern part of the
country.
