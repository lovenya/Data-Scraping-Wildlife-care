BHOPAL:
In a major breakthrough, Madhya Pradesh Special Task Force (Wildlife),
on Saturday arrested Barsul, who was wanted in connection with several
tiger poaching cases.
In 2014, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court
had granted bail to Barsul and his relative Yarlen after they were
arrested. Barsul was on the run since then.

Said to be a key
member of an International poaching syndicate and allegedly involved in
killing of nearly a dozen tigers in MP and Maharashtra, Yarlen and his
uncle Barsul were picked up in June 2013 and handed over to state
forest officials by MP STF after a long chase.
Despite sustained interrogation, both had misled the investigators by identifying themselves as Aryan and Lusalen respectively.

During
the initial investigations, the Call Detail Records (CDRs) of Yarlen’s
mobile had revealed that he was in touch with Mamru and Chika, who had
allegedly poached tigers in Maharashtra’s Melghat town.
