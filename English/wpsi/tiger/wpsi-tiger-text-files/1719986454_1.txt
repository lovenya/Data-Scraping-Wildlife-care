Shahjahanpur:
In yet another incident of man-tiger conflict, an adult male tiger -
caught in a poacher’s snare - died during a botched rescue operation on
Wednesday. In fact, the rescue operation not only went horribly wrong,
strangely forest department officials in Maheshpur range of Lakhimpur
Kheri reached the spot after nearly five hours.

Incidentally,
this is the second such incident in Lakhimpur Kheri in six months. An
adult tigress was butchered by villagers inside the core forest area of
Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary near Chaltua village on November 5.

On
Wednesday morning, local villagers in Shivpuri heard painful growls of
a big cat from a crop field adjacent to a forest area in Maheshpur. A
few villagers then went to check the area. Soon they found a tiger
caught in a snare, writhing in pain. The tiger had actually severely
wounded itself while trying to get out of the snare.
