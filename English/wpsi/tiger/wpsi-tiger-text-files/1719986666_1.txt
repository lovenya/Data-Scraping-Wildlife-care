Cyclone Amphan rips off tiger fence in Sunderbans 

 

6 Oct 2020




Cyclone
Amphan has damaged almost the entire nylon fencing that had been
erected to prevent tigers from entering human habitation in the
Sunderbans, triggering fears among forest officials of a recurrence of
man-animal conflict in Bengal’s largest tiger reserve.

Apart
from preventing tigers from straying into villages bordering
Bangladesh, the fencing also worked as a bulwark against poachers,
forest officials said.

“The entire nylon fencing has been blown
away in the cyclone and we have to restore over 100km-long nets again.
Since the fencing was set up, the number of attacks by tigers on humans
had almost come down to zero. It is a matter of serious concern and we
are trying to rebuild it,” said forest minister Rajib Banerjee.

Earlier,
forest officials had estimated that part of the 52km-long fencing in
the coastal areas had been affected, but after primary assessment it
was found that the entire fencing had been wiped out.

Sources
said the work to set up the nylon fencing was first started in 2002 on
a 7km stretch in a village adjacent to the Sunderbans tiger reserve.
