Poaching, electrocution behind 31% tiger deaths in last 6 years

 

7th March 2019

Poaching
and electrocution were behind 31.5% (207) of the 656 tiger deaths
reported in the country between 2012 and 2018, according to data
released by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).

Around
40% of India’s estimated 2,226 tigers (2014 census) lives outside the
core areas of tiger habitats. These tigers are vulnerable to poaching
and come into conflict with humans. The data shows a rise in tiger
vulnerability with deaths reported 2016 onwards being in the three
digits as compared to being in two digits between 2012 and 2015. New
tiger numbers estimated to be released in a month will throw more light
on this aspect.

Interestingly, NTCA was not able to establish
the cause of death in 118 cases (18% of the total deaths), primarily
because of the state forest departments not updating the cause with the
authority.
