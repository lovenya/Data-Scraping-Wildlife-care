Nagpur:
Tigers dispersing to Telangana from Maharashtra’s central Chanda forest
division and Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary in Pandharkawda have been
scientifically recorded, but for the first time evidence of a tiger
dispersing from a sanctuary in the neighbouring state to Pranhita
sanctuary in Gadchiroli calls for exploring conservation potential of
the tribal district.

As per forest department record, there were
115 tigers in Gadchiroli district in 1989, but now there are only six,
including four sub-adults, in Wadsa forest division.

The 418sqkm
Pranhita sanctuary in Gadchiroli was notified on August 27, 2014, to
boost wildlife conservation. Since then, the sanctuary is being managed
by territorial division.
