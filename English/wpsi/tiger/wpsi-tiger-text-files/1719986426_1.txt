India can’t handle more tigers, say experts

While
conservation efforts are aimed at increasing the tiger count in India,
global experts and officials in the government suggest that India must
also prepare for a new challenge — of reaching the limits of its
management capacity.

Officially, India had 2,226 tigers as of
2014. An ongoing census is expected to reveal an update to these
numbers. But Rajesh Gopal, head of the Global Tiger Forum, said that
India’s current capacity to host tigers ranged from 2,500-3,000 tigers.

Moreover, said another official, 25-35% of India’s tigers now lived outside protected reserves.

With
dwindling core forest as well as the shrinking of tiger corridors
(strips of land that allow tigers to move unfettered across diverse
habitat), officials said there were several challenges — alongside the
traditional challenges of poaching and man-animal conflict — to India’s
success at tiger conservation. Recent attempts at translocating tigers
to unpopulated reserves, such as Satkosia in Orissa, have ended badly,
with one of the tigers dying.
