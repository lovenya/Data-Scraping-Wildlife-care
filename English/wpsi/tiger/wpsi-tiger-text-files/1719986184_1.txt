A
tigress was found dead on the border of the Corbett tiger reserve and
the adjoining range in Bijnor forest division in Uttar Pradesh. Though
the exact cause of death will be known after the receipt of the
post-mortem report, wildlife activists are calling for a thorough
investigation into this death because of some recent developments in
Corbett and neighbouring ranges in Uttar Pradesh which point at the
presence of poachers in the region.

Uttarakhand principal chief
conservator of forest, Raghu Bir Singh Rawat confirmed the discovery of
a dead tigress on Friday, adding that natural deaths of tigers and
leopards are bound to occur in Uttarakhand which has a population of
about 250 tigers. However, he stressed that the exact cause of the
tigress' death on Friday will be known after the post-mortem report is
received.

The body of the tigress was found at the border of
Kalagarh-Jhirna in Corbett with Amangarh range of Bijnor forest
division in neighbouring UP.

Earlier this week, a joint team of
Corbett and UP forest department personnel had discovered a steel trap
and other items used in wildlife crimes from the Sahuwala range in
Bijnor division. This discovery points towards the presence of poachers
in this area, suspected to members of the Bawaria community.
