14 Dec 2022Baripada:
While three suspended forest personnel were arrested on Wednesday
in connection with the secret burning of an elephant carcass in
Similipal Tiger Reserve, a Special Task Force (STF) team recovered a
skin of a Royal Bengal Tiger (RBT), which is on the verge of
extinction, at Sridamchandrapur village under Udala tehsil in Odisha’s
Mayurbhanj district and arrested a poacher.

The raid was
conducted on a tip-off and the poacher was nabbed while some officials
posing as buyers were striking a Rs 5 lakh deal for the tiger skin,
which was later seized from his possession. Two others, however,
managed to escape.

It is believed that the big cat was hunted a month back.
