Tiger spotted in Gujarat walked all the way from Ratapani in MP

 

14th Feb., 2019


BHOPAL: The tiger that trekked 300 km over two years to reach Gujarat —
the second longest recorded dispersal — is from Ratapani wildlife
sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, barely 50 km from Bhopal.

A
comparison of stripes from photographs taken during its journey prove
it’s from MP, say wildlife officials. “This is our tiger. We have
matched the images,” said Ujjain chief conservator of forests, B S
Annigiri. “We were tracking it till it was in our jurisdiction. Now
that it has reached Gujarat, they will take care of it. After all,
animals have no borders,” he added.

The limelight on this tiger
comes at a time when the MP forest department has decided to notify the
densely-populated tiger habitat region of Ratapani as a wildlife
division.
