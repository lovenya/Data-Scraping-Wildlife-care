JAIPUR:
Large-scale transfers of forest personnel has crippled tiger tracking
and village relocation programme at Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR)
where big cats were reintroduced by the Vasundhara Raje government in
2018.

To highlight the issue, the reserve’s DFO has written to
principal chief conservator of forests & head of the forest force
(HoFF) to deploy more guards and cancel transfer orders as only 54
guards were left in the reserve against 111 sanctioned posts.

“At
MHTR, work related with tiger monitoring, anti-poaching, anti-grazing,
tiger translocation and conservation is in progress. Here, like
Rathambore and Sariska , provision of STPF (Special Tiger Protection
Force) has not been made by the department. Due to shortage of guards,
there will be an additional burden on the remaining staff and could
affect tiger monitoring,” the Septermber 30 letters stated.
