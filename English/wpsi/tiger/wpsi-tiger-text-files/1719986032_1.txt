Jet Airways and Kingfisher airlines have regularly been used in smuggling of body parts of endangered species.

The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) informed this as response to the RTI query filed by Governance Now.

“As
per the information received by the Bureau, the Jet Airways and
Kingfisher airlines had been used in illegal wildlife trade cases,”
said the reply signed by Ramesh K Pandey, central public information
officer, WCCB.

WCCB, which comes under the ministry of
environment and forests (MOEF), also informed that since its inception
in 2007, the bureau has twice received information pertaining to the
involvement of private airlines in smuggling of wildlife articles.

According
to the reply, WCCB is aware about a consignment of wildlife parts
including that of tigers that was caught at Guwahati airport destined
to Imphal through a passenger airline.

WCCB and other
enforcement agencies have been regularly feeding the MOEF on private
airlines being used in illegal wildlife trade.

The issue was
last raised in the second meeting of the special coordination committee
on wildlife crime which took place n January 20.

The meeting was
