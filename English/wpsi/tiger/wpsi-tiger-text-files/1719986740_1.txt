A tiger that had crossed a big stretch of Matla river to move into the
village side from the forest of the Indian Sunderbans has kept
foresters and villagers on their toes for the past four days.

The
big cat, a forest department official said, has crossed almost a 3.5km
stretch of the river from Herobhanga 5 forest to enter Gopalganj
village of Kultali on December 23.

“Since then, it has covered
almost 15km in four days through villages of Gopalganj, Garankathi —
popularly known as the Piyali island — and Dongashora Shekherghat,”
said South 24 Parganas forest division DFO Milan Mondal.

At its
latest location in Dongashora, two villagers were injured on Sunday
morning after falling off a tree trying to catch a glimpse of the tiger.
