19 tigers, 25 leopards electrocuted in 5 years in Maharashtra

 

5 Jan 2022NAGPUR:
Though the forest department has managed to bust gangs of organized
tiger poachers, there is no let-up in killing of wild animals either by
local poachers for bushmeat or by farmers to protect crops. 

Analysis
of data compiled by NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI)
revealed that in the last five years, beginning January 1, 2017 to
December 31, 2021, at least 18 tigers and 25 leopards have been
electrocuted in the state. One tigress was electrocuted in Bhadravati
on January 3, 2022.

Retired conservator of forest (CF) Sanjay
Thaware, who is himself a farmer and was in charge of conflict-affected
Bramhapuri division, admits, “The problem is albeit grave, but we need
to hear the farmers’ side too.”
