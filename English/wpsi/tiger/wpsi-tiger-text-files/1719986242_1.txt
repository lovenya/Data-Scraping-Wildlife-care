Speaking
For Tigers: A Call to End Asia's Illegal Trade


NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC - PROOF

Our
driver turned off one of Nagpur’s main thoroughfares, leaving the
honking chaos of urban Indian traffic behind us. We pulled into the
bucolic tropical campus that housed Forest Department offices. At the
gate we were stopped and questioned by guards who meticulously checked
our credentials and called their superiors before finally waving us
inside. Security was high: The confiscated tiger skins that Steve
Winter and I had come to film and photograph for National Geographic
were worth a small fortune on the black market—and forest officials had
been gunned down in heists of tiger contraband before



When we
arrived, guards were laying out the pelts for us, carrying them with
great tenderness and a solemnity that made me feel like I was attending
a funeral. Some of the skins had been processed into rugs, with heads
still attached, gazing at us with marble eyes. Others were desiccated,
with shrunken heads.



That footage became part of a video on India’s illegal tiger trade and
a blog post on why tigers are “walking gold.”



It was the kind of assignment that both breaks your heart and drives
you to continue.
