Big cats in conflict with humans won’t be called man-eaters

BENGALURU:
Big cats attacking and feeding on humans won’t be called man-eaters any
more. The revised standard operating procedure drawn up by National
Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for dealing with big cats straying
into human-dominated landscapes has replaced the term ‘man-eater’ with
‘dangerous to human life’.

The new guidelines also ban
non-departmental individuals, like private sharpshooters, from
participating in operations to eliminate/tranquillise or capture tigers
in conflict. The development comes in the wake of the controversy over
death of tigress Avni in Maharashtra last year.

Environmentalists
and veterinarians hailed removal of the word ‘man-eater’, which they
said was a cruel description. However, the new term is quite broad and
hasn’t been defined well, they felt, pointing out there are chances
that tigers which haven’t killed humans may end up getting the
‘dangerous to human life’ tag and eventually be captured or killed.
