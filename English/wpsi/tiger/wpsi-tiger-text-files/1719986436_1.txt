No tiger spotted in 3 years at Palamau park

 

17th Feb., 2019


One
of India’s first tiger habitats, declared a protected forest reserve in
1973 when Project Tiger was launched, may have lost all its tigers,
according to two crucial scientific methods to track big cats in the
wild.

No tiger has been seen in Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR) on
camera trap pictures clicked since 2016, and a scat analysis (in which
faeces is used to identify animals) conducted this year has found no
evidence of a tiger in the forest, according to officials familiar with
the matter.

Once officially confirmed, this will make PTR the
third reserve in the country — after Sariska in Rajasthan and Panna in
Madhya Pradesh — from where tigers vanished, even though the national
population of tigers has risen from 1,114 in 2006 to 2,226 in 2014.
Tigers have been relocated to Sariska and Panna over the last decade.
The population is 17 tigers including cubs and 37 in the two reserves
respectively.

A national tiger census has been underway since
2018 and its findings are expected to be published in May 2019. The
scat analysis and camera traps are part of the 2018 All India Tiger
Estimation’s (AITE) comprehensive methodology to calculate the tiger
population in the country.
