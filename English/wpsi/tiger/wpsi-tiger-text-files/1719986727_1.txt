DEHRADUN: A
committee formed by National Tiger Conservation Authority to
investigate allegations of illegal construction in Corbett Tiger
Reserve (CTR) in Uttarakhand has found that in order to allow illegal
construction and buildings in the protected sanctuary, state forest
department officials forged the government records and violated the
laws. 

"The entire ongoing construction activities in one of
the highest density tiger habitat of the world without any competent
sanctions and by violating the various statutory provisions/court
orders is an excellent example of both administrative and managerial
failure. Appropriate actions are reqyired against all the forest
officers responsible for such grave violations, " stated the NTCA
committee report dated October 22, 2021

The NTCA committee has also recommended initiating action against state forest officials including vigilance inquiry.
