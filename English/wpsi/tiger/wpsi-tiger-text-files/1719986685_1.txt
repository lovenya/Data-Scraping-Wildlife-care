Tiger conservation body seeks report from Odisha on ecotourism inside reserve

 

22 Dec 2020


The
National Tiger Conservation Authority has asked Odisha chief wildlife
warden to submit a status report on the adverse impact of tourism on
Satkosia Tiger Reserve by December 18. The move came after wildlife
activist Biswajit Mohanty alleged that ecotourism activities like
camping on sand resorts, river cruise and treetop bridge walks were
having an adverse impact on the local wildlife.

In his letter to
the NTCA, Mohanty had complained that pitching of 20 tents at Badmul on
Mahanadi riverbed inside the Satkosia Tiger Reserve would be extremely
harmful for local wildlife.

“Riverbeds are unique ecological
spaces that deserve to be left alone. The Mahanadi river bed within the
tiger reserve is used for basking and nesting by turtles and
crocodiles. Birds like Indian Skimmers, terns and Pratincoles use it
for nesting and feeding. Setting up of tents and allowing tourists to
stay on river beds impacts such wildlife and affects their ecological
needs, including basking which is vital for metabolism of cold blooded
creatures.
