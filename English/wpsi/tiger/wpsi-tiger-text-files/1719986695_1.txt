HANDRAPUR:
In a joint operation, the rapid response units of Tadoba and Chandrapur
division rescued a six-month-old tiger cub trapped in a large farm well
near Dabgaon village under Chichpalli range on Wednesday afternoon.
For the first time in Chandrapur, rescue teams used a catch pole which helped to safely lift the cub out of the well.

The
matter came to light after a farmer heard hooting of monkeys close to
the farm well. He went to check the place and found the cub perched on
an outcrop deep into the well.The
farmer immediately called the forest officers. “The cub might have
fallen into the well while its mother was moving around the place
during the early hours. The well though has a parapet wall, it is at
the surface level on two sides from where the cub might have fallen,”
said RFO, Chichpalli, Vaibhav Rajurkar.
