A full grown Royal Bengal Tiger was hunted down by villagers of Numuk in Arunachal Pradesh's West Siang district.

Villagers
gathered around the tiger after the kill. The meat was then consumed by
the people but even more disturbing is the information of a possible
wild life trade racket flourishing in that area. 

The skin of the tiger was allegedly sold to a certain businessman from Assam for 1.5 lakh rupees.

"They
must have gone for some small animal hunt and came across this tiger
and killed it. It is about 30 km from Along. It was a heavy animal,
even four persons could not carry it properly, you may have seen the
picture. Gun ammunition was used to shoot. The skin was sold to some
trader from Guwahati at Silapathar. Wildlife authorities talk about
penalties but wildlife crime is going on. This is the season of deer
hunting and deer is being hunted regularly," said Tapak Kato, an
eyewitness from Namuk.

In the last one year this is the third
incident of tiger hunting in the area but the first time that there was
photographic evidence.
