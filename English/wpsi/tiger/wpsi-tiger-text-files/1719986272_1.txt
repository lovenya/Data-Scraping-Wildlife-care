Conviction in 13 Year Old Tiger Poaching Case



April 14, 2015

On
10 April 2015, the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Katni, convicted 6
poachers for shooting a tiger and skinning it in Bahoriband range of
Katni division, Madhya Pradesh in January 2002. Two firearms including
one muzzle loading gun, and a 12 bore gun, were seized from the accused
at the time. One of the persons convicted in this case was the
president of the Van Suraksha Samiti (Forest Protection Committee) at
the time of the incident.

The forest department prosecutor in
this case, Ms. Manjula Srivastava, deserves special credit for her hard
work and perseverance. This included the use of handwriting experts to
establish the authenticity of the post mortem report for the tiger,
since the veterinary doctor who had written it passed away during the
course of the trial.

The accused were convicted to 3 years
imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. On request by the
prosecution, the court directed the fine amount of Rs. 60,000 to be
given to the forest department as compensation, for its use in forest
protection.
