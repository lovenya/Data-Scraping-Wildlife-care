China's
Threat to Wild Tigers

EARLIER
this year, a police raid on a house party in Leizhou, Guangdong
Province, in southern China, revealed a decadent diversion apparently
popular among some of China’s elite: watching a tiger being slaughtered
and butchered, then gorging on meat that’s considered an exotic
delicacy.



Fifteen people were arrested and charged with killing
more than 10 tigers in the past few years. One of them, a real estate
developer identified as Mr. Xu, pleaded guilty to consuming three
tigers in 2013. A prosecutor said he had “a quirky appetite for eating
tiger penis and drinking tiger blood.”



The Nanfang Daily
reported that these “visual feasts” had become fashionable among
wealthy businessmen and government officials. One official told China
Daily that the privileged staged these dinners “as a form of
entertainment and to show off their wealth.”



The demise of the
tiger, the world’s most endangered big cat, was hastened by demand for
traditional Chinese medicine, which ascribed healing properties to
nearly every part of the cat, from whiskers to tail.



But that
has changed, says a new report commissioned by the secretariat of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which
regulates that trade under a treaty signed by 180 nations.



“
‘Wealth’ [is] replacing ‘health’ as a primary form of consumer
motivation,” the report says. Tiger parts “are now consumed less as
medicine and more as exotic luxury products.”
