Nagpur:
The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), an apex body under the
environment ministry to combat organized wildlife crime, has arrested
tiger skin and body parts trader Mishram Jakhad, 81, from Dwarka.
Jakhad has been linked to the Gadchiroli tiger poaching cases.



WCCB
officials said Jakhad controls and directs tiger poaching and illegal
trade of tiger body parts. He not only sponsors the illegal trade
syndicate but also earns huge money from the poachers and smugglers,
and also blackmails them. According to sources, WCCB officials knew
Jakhad as he used to share intelligence with them. The trader’s younger
son had also worked with WCCB.



On July 31, 2023, the special
investigating team (SIT) of WCCB along with the team from Gadchiroli
raided the suspect’s premises. Jakhad was arrested with cash ₹14.8 lakh
suspected to be linked to illegal trade in tiger parts.
