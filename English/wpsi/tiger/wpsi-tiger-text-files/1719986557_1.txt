NTCA proposes reward for frontline staff

 

4 Sep 2019


To
keep the morale high of the frontline staff,  who are the first
line of defence against wildlife poaching, forest fires, timber
smugglers and other activities that degrade the wildlife habitats in
tiger reserves,  the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)
has for the first time come out with a proposal to annually reward the
best among the unsung heroes.

Anup K Nayak, member secretary,
NTCA ,  said that the reward is mainly for extraordinary efforts
put in by the frontline staff in overall tiger conservation.  "The
move was much-needed. These frontline forest staff risk their lives as
they patrol day and night to protect our vulnerable flora and fauna by
chasing and confronting timber smugglers or poachers.

The
proposal to give rewards to such frontline staff in the ranks of
foresters, forest guard and watchers for extraordinary performance was
recommended by 2nd technical committee meeting of the NTCA held
recently,"  he said.
