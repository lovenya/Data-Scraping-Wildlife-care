Nagpur
: In only the second case of its kind in the state and the first in
Vidarbha, four persons were convicted in a tiger poaching case on
Saturday by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court of Sakoli,
Bhandara.

JMFC, AR Surve, sentenced Chandkiran Kodape, Tarachand
Soyam, Sampat Soyam and Shiva Pingare to three years in jail and
imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on them for poisoning a tiger on September
29, 1992, near Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary.

The tiger had killed a cow and the accused had poisoned the carcass later using the chemical Thimet.

Range
Forest Officer (RFO) Pradip Kottewar had investigated the case and
seized the tiger skin from the accused. Assistant Conservator of Forest
(Wildlife) Kishore Mishrikotkar pushed the case to bring about the
conviction.

Assistant Public Prosecutor H P Randive said, “In
the absence of efforts by forest officers like Kottewar and
Mishrikotkar, it’s difficult to get convictions. Most of the time,
officers are transferred and not available to attend proceedings...”

“Maharashtra
doesn’t have dedicated green courts like MP where conviction rate is
higher...,” said wildlife crime expert Nitin Desai, Central India
director of Wildlife Protection Society of India.

Randive said the first conviction for tiger poaching in the state was in Thane.
