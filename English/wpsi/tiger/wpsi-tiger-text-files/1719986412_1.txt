The Tiger brought from Kanha Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh to
Odisha’s Satkosia is reported to be dead after forest officials
stumbled upon its carcass in the wildlife sanctuary’s core area.

Odisha, this is the second case of a tiger dying within three weeks.
Earlier, in October, forest officials discovered the carcass of a male
tiger in Debrigarh Sanctuary. The state Crime Branch, investigating the
case, is interrogating four alleged poachers arrested on this matter.

Releasing
a statement on the preliminary findings, the forest department said, “A
deep lacerated and five-days-old infected wound was observed on the
dorsal neck region of the tiger, which may be the cause of the
mortality”.

It further added that the incident occurred “500 metres from Raigoda to Nuagoda forest road inside… Athgarh Forest Division”.
