Year of the Tiger: Illegal trade thrives amid efforts to save wild tigers

 

31 May 2022In Sin City, the illegal tiger-farming business is thriving.

In
new, covert drone footage, tigers and bears pace inside prison-like
cement and corrugated steel cages near a casino complex — a newly
built, expanded commercial captive-breeding facility on the banks of
the Mekong River in Laos. The video, obtained by the Environmental
Investigation Agency (EIA), reveals that tiger numbers there have
doubled since the U.K. nonprofit’s 2015 “Sin City” exposé.

Farming
tigers for their parts, like pigs and chickens, violates an
international treaty, though it continues here in Laos, and in China,
Vietnam and Thailand. The illicit trade also violates Laos’s commitment
to convert tiger farms to zoos and stop breeding.
