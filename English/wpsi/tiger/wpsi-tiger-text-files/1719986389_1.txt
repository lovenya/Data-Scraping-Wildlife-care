How this Bihar sanctuary tripled tiger numbers in 10 yrs

Many
of the streams flowing through the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar, just
1km from the border with Nepal, are dry this summer. As the sun tilts
west and the breeze turns gentle, herbivores emerge — spotted, barking
and hog deer, monkeys, wild boar and a sloth bear. Close to a waterhole
is a deer carcass, abandoned by a tiger.

“This is a fresh kill,”
field director S Chandrashekhar observes. Divisional Forest Officer
Gaurav Ojha confers with the tiger trackers. “T3 ka shaavak hai (T3’s
cub),” tracker Mithilesh tells the officer after measuring pugmarks,
referring to the codename of the mother. “This cub has made its first
reported kill. Soon he’ll mark his terrain and win mating rights,” Ojha
says.

The 900sqkm reserve has scripted a remarkable success
story in tiger conservation. In the 1980s and 1990s, the forest, then
looked after by the Bihar government, was full of people and machines
engaged in pebble mining. The stone crushing units and gensets threw up
dust and noise. Funds for staff salaries and conservation programmes
were short, and the tiger census was irregular.

Poaching was also rampant and tiger numbers were dwindling.
