60 years after they were last seen, tigers to come back to Madhya Pradesh’s Madhav National Park 

 

26 Sep 2022Tigers
will be reintroduced in the Madhav National Park (MNP) of Madhya
Pradesh more than six decades after they were last seen there, an
official told Down To Earth September 26, 2022.

The National
Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has given the green signal to
relocate five tigers from three national parks of the state to MNP.

“We
will be bringing the tigers from Panna, Bandhavgarh and Satpura
National Parks to the MNP of Shivpuri. This is to ensure genetic
diversity. If the need arises, we will move more individuals from
forests near Bhopal where sightings of tigers are very frequent,” JS
Chouhan, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Madhya Pradesh,
told DTE.

Three tigers – one male and two females — will be
moved to MNP in the first stage with the stated aim of boosting
tourism. MNP already has leopards.

Chouhan said the relocation
was likely to happen sometime in winter and that the park was already
prepared to receive the animals.

“These are wild animals and to
ensure their health and well-being, it is necessary to move them from
one place to another at regular intervals to promote more genetic
diversity.
