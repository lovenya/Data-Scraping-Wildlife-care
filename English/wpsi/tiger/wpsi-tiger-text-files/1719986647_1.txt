Decline in Tiger Population in Odisha Linked to Poaching

 

29 July 2020



New
Delhi: Although the latest tiger census report of National Tiger
Conservation Authority has asserted a steady rise in India's tiger
population, the number of big cats has gone down considerably in the
past few years in Odisha, a cause of concern for the environment,
forest, and also for tiger lovers.

The full report of the
All-India Tiger census results of 2018 was released by Environment and
Forests Minister Prakash Javedakar on Tuesday.

India is ready to
take leadership, work with 13 tiger range countries for management of
tiger reserves, Javadaker said after the release of the report.

While
the all-India results of 2,967 tigers (2018) compared to 2,226 tigers
in 2014 have brought cheer to some, the two tiger reserves of Odisha,
Satkosia and Simlipal, have revealed shocking decline in their
population. Most other states have done well adding huge numbers in the
four year period after 2014.

This is a periodic count undertaken
throughout the country by NTCA in collaboration with state Forest
Departments and NGOs. The camera capture-recapture method is used for
the count, which is the latest available scientific method accepted
worldwide.

According to the report, a total of 141 camera traps
were laid in Simlipal, and 4,400 trap nights were spent in capturing
tiger pictures.
