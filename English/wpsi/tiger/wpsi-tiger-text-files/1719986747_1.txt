NAGPUR:
In a hit-and-run case, an adult male tiger (T1) from Chorbahuli range
of Mansinghdeo wildlife sanctuary in Pench Tiger Reserve, also known as
‘Mystery Male’, was injured on Tuesday.

The tiger is suspected
to have been hit by a speeding vehicle either in the night or during
the wee hours while crossing the NH7. The incident came to light around
10.15am when a family, which was on its way to Nagpur from Narsinghpur
to treat its son, had stopped close to the guide wall near Paoni to
attend nature’s call.

A woman from the family, aged around 58,
went a little deep in the forest and didn’t have any idea about the
tiger that was lying injured.
