Authorities
in Assam’s Kaziranga National Park have found the carcass of a
semi-adult male, taking the number of tiger deaths in the park to four
this year.

P Sivakumar, director of the park, said the carcass
of the two-year-old tiger was found in the Burapahar range of the 430
sq km park, the biggest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world.

“The
carcass was found on Friday. It bore several injury marks and the skull
was almost crushed. Investigation suggests that it had died due to
infighting with other male tigers the previous day,” he said.

This is the second such death reported this month and the fourth one this year. All cases are the outcome of infighting.

On
May 10, the carcass of a semi-adult tigress was found in the Bagori
range and in April an adult tiger was found dead in the Kohora range.
In January, the carcass of a three-month-old tiger was found.
