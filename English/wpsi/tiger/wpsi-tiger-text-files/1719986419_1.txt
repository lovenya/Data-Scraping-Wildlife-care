22nd November 2018



Nagpur: Even as the 79th session of the Indian Road Congress (IRC)
is set to kick off from Thursday without any discussions on mitigation
measures for wildlife, the new road development projects in Tadoba
landscape is set to post a big threat to Maharashtra’s tiger population.On
November 11, Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation
stone for several road development and repair works for 576km worth
Rs5,356 crores in Chandrapur district alone, where Tadoba is located.
Of these, roughly over 100km will cut through tiger corridors making
their dispersal a huge problem.

As per latest WII report
released in June, there is presence of at least 200 tigers in the
Eastern Vidarbha Landscape in Chandrapur, Gondia, Bhandara, Gadchiroli,
Nagpur and Yavatmal districts. In some stretches road development is
already going on while on others it is proposed, all sans any
mitigation steps. Wildlife experts say Tadoba landscape will be most
vulnerable as 60% of the state’s tiger population is present there.
