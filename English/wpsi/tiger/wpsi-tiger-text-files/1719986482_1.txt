27 June 2019



A
tiger was caught on camera in the Uttarakhand’s Kedarnath Wildlife
Sanctuary at an altitude of 3400m (approximately 11,154 ft) above mean
sea level, officials said on Wednesday.

The tiger was spotted on
May 26 at 2:38 am in a valley that falls under the Kedarnath forest
division.The sighting of the tiger at this unusual height indicated
that the big cat was changing its habitat, said experts. “We had put
camera traps in this area at a height of around 3500m and the tiger was
spotted at a height of 3400m. Tiger are generally found in low altitude
areas, and such a sighting clearly shows that tigers are changing their
habitat,” said Amit Kanwar, divisional forest officer, Kedarnath.

In
2016,a tiger was spotted at 3274m (approximately 10,741 ft) in Askot in
Uttarakhand. Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim have also reported the
presence of big cats at similar elevations. India is home to 2,226
tigers, according to the All India Tiger Estimation, 2015. The present
spotting of tiger at 3400m is likely to be the highest in the country.
Before this, a tiger was spotted at 3274 m in Askot landscape in March
2016, which was then said to be the highest in the country by a
Wildlife Institute of India report.
