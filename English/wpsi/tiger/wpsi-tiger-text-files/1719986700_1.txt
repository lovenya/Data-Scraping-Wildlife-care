Kozhikode:
Forest officer T Sasi Kumar of Chethalath range in Wayanad Wildlife
Sanctuary (WWS) will hang up his boots on Monday after an action-packed
career spanning 36 years that left him with two deep, tiger-bite scars
on his head and shoulder. Being at the frontline of man-animal
conflicts in Wayanad, Kumar’s life was saved by a whisker in the two
tiger attacks he faced during the past 10 months.

While a tiger
sank its teeth through the helmet to bite on his head in the first
attack at Panakolli near Pulpally in October 2020, in the second attack
Kumar’s shoulder bones crumbled after the tiger bit deep into his left
shoulder in January. Kumar now has a steel plate on his shoulder after
the second attack that left him hospitalized for 25 days.The first attack took place when he, along with a team, went to drive away a tiger after it strayed into a compound of a house.
