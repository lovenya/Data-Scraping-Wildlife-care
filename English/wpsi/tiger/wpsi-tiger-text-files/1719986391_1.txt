NAGPUR:
Of the 1,697 road, irrigation and railway projects, 399 worth Rs 1.3
lakh crore are coming up in the tiger landscape of Central India and
Eastern Ghats. Spread over eight states, the area is home to 688 (31%)
of the country's 2,226 tigers and these projects threaten the existence
of the big cats. These facts have been highlighted in a report ahead of
International Tiger Day, which is observed on July 29 every year.

Significantly,
proposers of 345 of the 399 projects are not aware of the tiger
corridor status of forestland patches that they seek to divert. Such
unplanned development threatens the future of tigers in the country,
says 'Policy framework for connectivity conservation and smart green
linear infrastructure development in the Central Indian & Eastern
Ghats Tiger Landscape'. The report has been prepared by Wildlife
Conservation Trust researchers Milind Pariwakam, Aditya Joshi, Sheetal
Navgire and Srinivas Vaidyanathan.

"We hope this report will be
of use to all stakeholders for a truly win-win solution for
conservation and smart green development in the spirit of the PM's
statement," said Pariwakam, who is the lead author. Read full story here
