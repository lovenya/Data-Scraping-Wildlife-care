BHOPAL: A
tiger was electrocuted by a live wire trap, probably set for game meat,
in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh. This takes the number of tiger
deaths this year to 14.

The carcass was found in Majhgawan
forest area on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. Forest
officials said the poachers had laid the trap near a canal in Dudhmunia
forest, close to Ranipur wildlife sanctuary of Uttar Pradesh, knowing
that animals would come there to drink water.

The tiger's body
parts - including paws, claws, whiskers and hide - were intact. In the
past two weeks, two tigers and a leopard have been killed by poachers
through electrocution in the Satpura-Maikal landscape of central India
- the world's largest natural habitat of tigers, located between MP and
Maharashtra - in the hope of making cash rain from the skies through
black magic.
