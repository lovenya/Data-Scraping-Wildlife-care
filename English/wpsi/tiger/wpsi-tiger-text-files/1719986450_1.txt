Climate change imperils Sundarbans tiger habitats

 

26th March 2019


In
50 years from now, by 2070, the entire population of Bengal tigers in
the Sundarbans mangroves in Bangladesh is likely to be lost to climate
change and sea level rise, a modeling study by Bangladesh and
Australian researchers has predicted.

Further, by 2050
researchers forecast that a Ceriops decandra-dominated mangrove stretch
along the India-Bangladesh border would potentially be the only refuge
of the big cats in the Sundarbans, underpinning the urgency of
executing transboundary measures in conservation. “If we don’t look
after Bengal tigers and their critical habitats, our studies show a
rapid decline in the Bengal tiger population and suitable tiger
habitats in the Bangladesh Sundarbans area by 2050, and a complete loss
of this species by 2070,” said the corresponding author of the study,
Sharif A. Mukul.

Spanning more than 10,000 square kilometres,
the Sundarbans region of Bangladesh and India is the biggest mangrove
forest in the world and also the most critical area for Bengal tiger
survival. Sprawled out across 6,017 square kilometres, the Bangladesh
side of the forest covers nearly 60 percent of the total area of the
Sundarbans. The rest is in India.
