HYDERABAD:
The state forest department officials proposed diversion of 1,136
hectares or about 2,800 acres of prime forest area forming a part of
the Tiger corridor between Tadoba Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, Kawal
Tiger Reserve in Telangana and Indravathi Tiger Reserve in Chattisgarh
for the construction of Pranahita irrigation canal during the 44th
meeting of standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife that
was held on July 29.The officials proposed the diversions based on a
few compensatory measures to be taken for loss of forest cover like
construction of 16 eco-bridges and provision of drinking water in check
dams. Besides this, officials also said that necessary measures will
taken so that the wildlife will not be disturbed during construction of
the canal.

The National Tiger Conservation Authority did not raise any objection to this.
The
standing committee did not give an immediate go ahead to this plan and
ordered the Wildlife Institute of India to form a team to visit the
proposed area and submit a detailed report to the Ministry of
Environment and Forests in two weeks.
