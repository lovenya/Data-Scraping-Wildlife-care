Are tiger deaths being suppressed?

 

9th Nov., 2016



According to a wildlife enthusiasts group ClaW, the national
authority’s data is not recording all the deaths, as nine tiger deaths
are not accounted for; authority rubbishes claim and says it is the
only authentic source for tally

Something sinister is afoot in
the wildlife, at least according to a group of wildlife enthusiasts.
Member of Conservation Lenses And Wildlife (ClaW) claim that the
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) data is under reporting
cases of tiger deaths as its data of 76 deaths between January and
October in 2016 is at odds with the group’s estimate — with data to
back that claim — of 85 tigers in the same period.

Let’s talk numbers
According
to the data released by Tigernet, a collaboration between NTCA and
Traffic India, states that there have been 78 deaths in 2016 till now,
as against 69 deaths in the same period in 2015. The website also
states that in 2016, there were 20 cases of tiger body parts seized as
against 8 last year.

The highest death rate was reported in
Madhya Pradesh with 25, while Maharashtra and Karnataka follow up with
13 deaths each.
