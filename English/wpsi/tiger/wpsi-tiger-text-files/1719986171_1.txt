Palamu Tiger Reserve's lone male tiger counting its days
 
Jul 24, 2012

DALTONGANJ:
The Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) has just one aging male tiger. The tiger
is about 9 to10 years old. Average life span of a tiger is 12 years
that too only if it is not domesticated or kept in captive.
Sources in the PTR said going by this account the lone male tiger of PTR has not many years to live on.

The
actual crisis will arise when this lone male tiger dies. The PTR
officials when asked conceded this to be a major cause of concern.
However none of the officials were ready to give comment officially.
"We have been asked by the principal chief conservator of the
forest-cum-chief-wildlife warden A K Malhotra not to speak to media,"
said one official.

Sources said there are 5 female tigers in
PTR. Copulation is very rare now and the prey base for a tiger has
shrunk considerably. "A tiger now requires covering 30 to 40 sq km to
hunt its prey which is reducing its copulative power," the official
said.

"For a tiger the maximum prey base where it can have its
prey is 20 sq km. But in PTR the prey is not available and hence the
tigers have to toil a lot and move forward to catch a prey. So there is
very little time left for copulation," quipped the official on
conditions of anonymity.
