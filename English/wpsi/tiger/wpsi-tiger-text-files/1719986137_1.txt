Move comes after WPSI data reveals three tigers, 15
leopards, other endangered species poached in large numbers in state
this year alone

Taking cognizance of increasing incidents of
poaching across sanctuaries and national parks in the state, the forest
ministry plans to strengthen its anti-poaching measures by roping in
informers, and offering rewards for updates on illegal activities
involving wildlife. 

This development comes after the ministry
sought data from the Wildlife Protection Society of India, which claims
that three tigers and around 15 leopards, along with other endangered
animals and birds have been poached in large numbers this year alone in
the state.

The maximum numbers of cases related to poaching and
other illegal activities involving wildlife have been reported in
Maharashtra in 2012. "As the sanctuary areas are well-protected, most
of the incidents of poaching are happening outside the borders. 

We
are strengthening the anti-poaching system of informers and forest
guards to ensure that the corridors between the two paths of the
sanctuaries and the villages are protected," said principal secretary
(Forest) Pravin Pardeshi.
