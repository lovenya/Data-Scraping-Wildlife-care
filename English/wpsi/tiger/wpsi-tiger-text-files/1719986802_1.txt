PUNE:
India registered 146 tiger deaths from January to September 28 this
year, marking the highest figure since 2012, National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA) data shows. The data is a worrying trend
in India’s efforts to protect its tiger population as another source,
www.tigernet.nic.in, stated there has also been a surge in the seizure
of tiger body parts with 14 cases recorded so far this year, the
highest since 2017.

                        

The highest number of tiger deaths reported this year has been from
Madhya Pradesh (34), followed closely by Maharashtra (32).

                        

Of the 146 tiger deaths, 24 were of cubs. This can directly impact the
reproductive potential of the tiger population. Nearly 17 tiger deaths
have been reported from Uttarakhand, 11 from Assam, nine from
Karnataka, and five from Rajasthan, among others.
