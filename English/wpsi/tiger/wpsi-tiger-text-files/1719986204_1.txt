Stakeholders Told To Be On Alert Over Poachers' Use Of Furdan
 

Thursday, 11 July 2013 | PNS | Dehradun 
A
report generated by the Uttarakhand Forest Department has warned
officers, wildlife scientists and activists across Uttarakhand and
other Indian States about poachers using the pesticide Furadan
(Carbofuran) to poach big cats and birds.It
was earlier believed that poachers used Nuvan pesticide but Furadan is
more effective and poses a serious threat to wildlife protection as has
been recently revealed. Surprisingly, the State anti-poaching cell
chief is not aware of this revelation and is en route on a foreign tour.Wildlife
activists point out that poisoning of wildlife by both poachers and
villagers is a serious threat which requires monitoring of vulnerable
areas and regular interaction between the stakeholders. A tiger or
leopard poisoned with Furadan can die within an hour and it is hard to
ascertain its presence in forensic examination unless a particular test
is specifically asked for. There are also reports of poachers suspected
of using this pesticide to kill birds at water bodies to sell in the
local market.When asked about
what steps the State forest department plans to take to check the
threat of Furadan misuse for poaching wildlife, the anti-poaching cell
director SK Dutt said that he was not aware of the alert. “I am going
to Japan but I will talk to the officer concerned regarding this
report,” he said. Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) programme
manager Tito Joseph stressed on the need for regularly monitoring
vulnerable areas prone to misuse of the pesticide.“Since
this product is also legally used for agriculture, it is hard to ban it
because it will then be smuggled from an area where it is not banned.
Due to this, areas farmed near the forests should be monitored to check
on the misuse of Furadan while there should also be regular interaction
between the forest department and villagers.
