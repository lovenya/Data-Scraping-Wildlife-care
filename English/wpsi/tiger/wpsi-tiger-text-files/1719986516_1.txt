India's Tiger Population Rises to Nearly 3,000 Animals

 

29 July 2019



India’s tiger population has grown to nearly 3,000, making the country one of the safest habitats for the endangered animals.

Prime
Minister Narendra Modi released the tiger count for 2018 on Monday said
it’s a “historic achievement” for India as the big cat’s population had
dwindled to 1,400 about 14-15 years ago.

India estimates its
tiger population every four years. Environment Minister Prakash
Javadekar said the tiger population was 2,226 in the last count, in
2014.

The tiger is India’s national animal and it is categorized as endangered under the Wildlife Protection Act.

The
human conflict with tigers has gradually increased since the 1970s,
when India started a tiger conservation program that carved out
sanctuaries in national parks and made it a crime to kill them.
