China
and Vietnam on Wednesday justified making of traditional medicines with
bones and body parts of captive tigers, leading to a strong protest
from participating countries at the ongoing three-day Global Tiger
Recovery Programme (GTRP).

Both claimed that it was legal to
make traditional medicines with bones of captive tigers and that these
medicines are used for research purposes in its universities and
schools. China also refused to come up with any concrete commitments to
stop making of traditional medicines with tiger parts.

According
to sources, as signatories to the Global Tiger Initiative, both nations
have been asked to tighten up anti-poaching measures. China, which
claimed to have a wild tiger population of 40 to 50 cats, has four
species of tigers - the Amur, South China, Indo-China and Royal Bengal.

India, along with Nepal and Russia, shares top rank in big cat conservation among 13 tiger range countries.

According
to sources, India claimed to have not only spent $20 million in village
relocation from tiger reserves, but has also recently added 2,594 sq km
of tiger reserves, taking total area to above 50,000 sq km.

The
successful reintroduction of tigers in the wild at Panna Tiger Reserve
in Madhya Pradesh has also added a new chapter in conservation.

Taking
cue from India’s success story, Russia too claimed to begin its
reintroduction programme of tigers, Siberian tigers having become
extinct from the country. It is carrying out habitat revival strategies
with focus on increasing prey base. The population of snow leopards and
sambars has shown an increase since the last global tiger meet.

Nepal
vied for top honours in tiger conservation for stepping up its
anti-poaching measures. It claimed that not a single rhino or tiger had
been poached during the past 14 months.
