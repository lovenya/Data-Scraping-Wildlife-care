NAGPUR:
The tiger population going up in the state from 103 in 2006 to 169 in
2010 may be good news but the bad news is that there can be no policy
to protect corridors required for the tigers to disperse for a viable
population. 

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Union minister for
environment and forests Jairam Ramesh said protecting corridors was
impossible as all development would come to a standstill. "We cannot
come out with a policy on corridors," Ramesh stressed. 

Today,
tigers are facing the biggest threat from shrinking and fragmented
corridors between protected areas (PAs) connecting each other. Against
this backdrop, Ramesh's statement is disturbing. This is despite the
fact that environment minister himself admitting that one-third of the
tiger population resides outside protected areas (PAs).
