Officials keep watch as Panna tiger takes lost route

For
nearly a fortnight, Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR) authorities are closely
monitoring the movement of a male tiger heading towards Bandhavgarh
Tiger Reserve because if the animal reaches there, it will create
history by retracing a lost corridor.

The distance between the
two parks as the crow flies is about 120 kilometre. The big cats once
prowled freely in the Panna-Bandhavgarh corridor, but a large swathe of
it has now been lost due to fragmented habitat, agriculture and
development.

Named P 212, the tiger had covered nearly 70 km
from the southern boundary of the park at a fast clip before the recent
rains slowed it down. The big cat is being tracked from a radio-collar.

The
park authorities heaved a sigh of relief last week when it crossed a
human settlement. Villagers were reportedly unhappy because elephants
used by the monitoring party threatened crops and some wanted the
feline to be recaptured. The authorities, however, managed to persuade
them.

PTR director R S Murthy told The Indian Express that if
everything goes well, the tiger could take a month to complete the
journey. He said the park is neither guiding the tiger, nor interfering
with its natural movements.
