PANAJI:
The death toll of tigers rose to four in the state within four days,
after a tiger cub was found buried, while, a few meters away, the
carcass of the mother tigress was discovered in a decomposed condition
by forest officials on Wednesday. Earlier, on January 7, combing
operations by forest officials had found a dead cub.

The combing
operations were launched after the carcass of a four-year-old male
tiger was first spotted on January 5, in the forest of Golauli in
Sattari taluka.

Though forest officials said the tigers were
most probably killed after feeding on a poisoned buffalo, postmortem
carried out on three of the tiger carcasses have shown no evidence of
death due to poisoning.

“There is possibility that the tigers
died due to poisoning, but so far we have not found evidences. Our
investigation is in process. After forensic reports are available,
reason for the death of the tigers would be known. On Thursday,
postmortem of the fourth tiger (the cub found on Wednesday) will be
carried out,”
