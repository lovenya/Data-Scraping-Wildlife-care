KOLKATA:
The West Bengal forest department is set to get 14 tigers from
Kaziranga in Assam to be released at Buxa National Park in North
Bengal, state minister Jyotipriyo Mallick said.

The forest
minister said that 10 female and four male tigers would be brought from
Kaziranga forest as their habitat has similarities with the Buxa forest
area."This will be a major step
in increasing the tiger population of the state. The tigers would be
brought very soon," he told in an interview.
However, the state
government needs to relocate a few families living inside Buxa forest
for some years before bringing the big cats, and talks are on with
those families who will be given land for free at nearby human
habitations, Mallik said on the eve of International Tiger Day.

A
top forest official said footage of tigers stated to be of North Bengal
forests, including Buxa, have been found and there were reports of
sighting of the big cats by some tourists.
