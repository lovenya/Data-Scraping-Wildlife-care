BHUBANESWAR:
Similipal and Satakosia are among the 41 protected areas in the
country, where fresh tiger headcount will begin in November. 

The
ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) took this decision following
a three-day workshop where experts deliberated on the Best Management
Practices in Tiger Conservation'. A MoEF release said the November
census, titled Phase IV of the National Tiger Estimation Programme',
will initiate "intensive" annual monitoring of the big cats. 

Significantly,
the MoEF considers Similipal, one of the prime tiger reserves in the
country, as "problematic". It is categorized with Indravati, Palamau
and Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam reserves. Similipal has been in news for a
host of reasons, including Maoist attacks, timber smuggling and
poaching.
