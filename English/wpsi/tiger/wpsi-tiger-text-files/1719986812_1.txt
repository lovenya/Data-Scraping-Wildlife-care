Nagpur: In 2023, when India
celebrated 50 years of Project Tiger and announced presence of 3,682
big cats in the wild as per the All-India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2022,
the country lost 202 tigers.

                        

The figures have been compiled by Wildlife Protection Society of India
(WPSI), a wildlife conservation organization monitoring tiger and
leopard deaths in the country, for the period January 1 to December 24,
2023. 

                        

According to WPSI, the maximum number of tiger deaths in 2023 were
reported in Maharashtra where the toll crossed the half-century mark
for the first time. Almost 50% of tiger deaths in Maharashtra were
reported in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts.

                        

Even the official tiger death graph of National Tiger Conservation
Authority (NTCA), a statutory body monitoring all the tiger reserves in
the country, shows an upward trend since 2012. As per the NTCA tiger
mortality trend, 96 big cats had died in 2019, 106 in 2020, 127 in 2021
and 121 in 2022. As per the official data available with the NTCA,
there have been 168 tiger deaths in 2023, which is the highest in over
a decade.
