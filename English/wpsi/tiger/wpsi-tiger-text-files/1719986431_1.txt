3rd Feb., 2019


Nagpur: In yet another example of how tigers are falling prey to linear
intrusions, a full-grown tiger was seriously injured when it was hit by
a speeding vehicle on NH7 close to the Maharashtra side of the Pench
Tiger Reserve (PTR).
According to Pench chief conservator of forest
(CCF) and field director Ravikiran Govekar, the incident occurred
around 7pm when the tiger was crossing the four-lane highway near
Harnakund village.

Sources said the tiger crossed the road from
the territorial forest area and was going toward Pench when it was hit
by the speeding vehicle (MH40-AR-9585).

“There were blood stains
at the spot. The forest staff heard loud growling of the tiger from the
thickets. It may be injured and in pain. The sound was coming from
about 100 metres away from the highway,” said sources.

“We are
monitoring the situation and a proper decision will be taken after
seeing the condition of the tiger. Being dark, it will take time to
attend to it,” said Govekar.
