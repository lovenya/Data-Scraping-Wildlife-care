DEHRADUN:
After an extensive search that lasted six months, Uttarakhand police
have arrested the alleged mastermind of a tiger poaching gang from
whose possession five tiger skins had been recovered in March.



Ram
Bhagat, the kingpin of the gang, was arrested from Hoshiarpur area of
Punjab on Monday. A joint team of the special task force (STF) of
Uttarakhand police and Haridwar police made the arrest after they
received inputs about Bhagat's presence in Punjab. Police said that
Bhagat broke down during questioning and admitted to his crime.



On
March 13, Bhagat and four other members of his gang were allegedly
smuggling five tiger skins to Punjab. When confronted by an STF team in
Haridwar, Bhagat and three other gang members managed to escape. Their
accomplice Ram Chandra from Bhatinda was nabbed. The team seized five
tiger skins from their possession in what was called the biggest such
haul in the state. The skins were 10 to 12 ft in length and 6 to 7 ft
in breadth.
