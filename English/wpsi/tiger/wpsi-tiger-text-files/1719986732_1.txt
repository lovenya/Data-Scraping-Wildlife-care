NAGPUR: The
seizure of one more tiger skin and various other body parts from the
Gondpipri forest range under Central Chanda Division on Sunday night
just shows the drastic jump in poaching of tigers in Maharashtra. The
state has recorded 35 tiger deaths, with half (17) of the deaths due to
poaching, in the last 10 months.

A comparison of the figures of
last five years from the database by Wildlife Protection Society of
India (WPSI), which works with local communities and government
agencies to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade across the
country, reveals that Maharashtra tops in tiger poaching over the two
top tiger bearing states — Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.
