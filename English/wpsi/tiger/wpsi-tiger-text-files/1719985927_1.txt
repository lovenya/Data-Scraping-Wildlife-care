Sansar Chand discharged in Tiger bone CaseÂ 



In
a blow to the wildlife conservation movement in India, notorious
wildlife trader, Sansar Chand, allegedly involved in possessing and
trading skins of tigers, leopards and other animals, was discharged
today by a Delhi court, after the prosecution failed to prove his guilt
in a case dating back to 1993.

This case was registered against
Sansar Chand on 30th August 1993 when a huge cache of illegal wildlife
goods were siezed at Majnu-ka-Tila and nearby areas in Delhi. The
seized goods included nearly 400 kilograms of tiger bones, 43 leopard
skins, 128 otter skins, 8 tiger skins, and other skins of small cats,
civets and antelopes.

Sansar Chand was discharged on the grounds
of lack of evidence. The prosecution failed to establish any direct
link between the seized goods and Sansar Chand, and the fact that there
was no recovery from him went in his favour. However, charges have been
framed against the co-accused, Mohammad Yakoob. 

Sansar Chand
has been involved in poaching activities for over three decades; his
first wildlife case was registered against him in 1974. Since then,
there have been more than 57 wildlife cases filed against him and his
gang members in different parts of the country. In 2006, under
interrogation by the CBI, Sansar Chand apparently admitted to selling
470 tiger skins and 2,130 leopard skins to just four clients from Nepal
and Tibet. 

So far, Sansar Chand has been acquitted or
discharged in five cases in Delhi. He was convicted in two cases in
Delhi in 1982, and in one case in Rajasthan in 2004. He still has cases
pending against him in Delhi and Uttarakhand, and is currently in
prison in Ajmer in connection with several wildlife cases registered in
Rajasthan, including those in relation to the disappearance of tigers
from Sariska.
