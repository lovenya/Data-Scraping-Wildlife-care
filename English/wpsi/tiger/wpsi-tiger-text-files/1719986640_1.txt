No New Road Projects in Tiger Corridors of Maharashtra Without Complying with NTCA Plan: NGT

 

9 July 2020



The
National Green Tribunal has said that the Ministry of Road Transport
and Highways cannot proceed with new road projects in tiger corridors
in Maharashtra without complying with the action plan prepared by the
National Tiger Conservation Authority.

A bench headed by NGT
Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said compliance with the plan
prepared by NTCA "is necessary for precautions in view of potential of
affecting the wildlife".

The tribunal had taken cognisance of a
news report which claimed obstruction to tiger corridors by new road
projects in Maharashtra. The news report said necessary steps and
precautions in such road projects for protection of the environment and
wildlife were lacking.

On the issue of project expenditure, the
tribunal said it is not for the NGT to comment on the source of funding
and this has to be worked out between the Ministry of Road Transport
and Highways and the Maharashtra government.
