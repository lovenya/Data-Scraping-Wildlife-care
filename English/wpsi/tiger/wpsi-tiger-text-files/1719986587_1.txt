Mumbai:
The Centre has mapped tiger corridors inside and outside protected
areas across the country and developed a conservation plan for big
cats, which includes a strategy to streamline infrastructure projects
with mandatory inclusion of safe passages.

Union minister of
state for environment Babul Supriyo released the details of the plan in
Rajya Sabha on Monday. The plan has been formulated keeping in view the
all India tiger estimation results released in July that showed there
were 2,967 big cats in the country and that there has been a 6% annual
increase in their numbers since 2006.

The National Tiger
Conservation Authority (NTCA), under the Union environment ministry,
has published a document, titled Connecting Tiger Populations for
Long-term Conservation, in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of
India (WII), Dehradun. The document maps 32 major corridors and details
the tiger conservation plan under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
