 Noting
a 6 per cent rise in the tiger population in the country, experts on
Tuesday suggested a need for greater flexibility to increase habitat
for the feline for their protection.



Speaking at the national
workshop on monitoring systems for tigers intensive patrolling and
ecological status, Y V Jhalla, a principal scientist of the Wildlife
Institute of India (WII), said the 6 per cent increase in the
population of big cats was due to several measures taken to protect
them.



The recent count of the big cat has revealed that around
2,200 Royal Bengal Tigers and 7,910 leopards are present in 13 tiger
reserves in the country, he said, adding it was determined through
camera trap method now in use.



Experts from all the 13 tiger
reserves of the country stressed on greater flexibility to increase
tiger habitat and other favourable measures that could boost the
population of the big cat.



The workshop, organised by National
Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), was mainly held for interaction on
