The
Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) has agreed to divert
additional 25% forest land that was earlier categorised as no-go area
for setting up projects concerning infrastructure ministries such as
power, road and coal. This is after the Prime Minister's Office (PMO)
stepped in and pushed the ministry to fast-track project clearances.

Government
sources said the move has come as a huge relief for the industry, as
around 30-50 projects will now be taken up for consideration. It will
also provide access to some of India's best sites for natural resources
deep inside forests in tribal areas. "We are working on the finer
print," an official said. 

Moreover, the ministry has said
environment clearance for projects will come in 60 days and forest
clearance in 180 days after all the documents are submitted. The
environment ministry has also listed priority projects for
consideration of its Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), which is
mandated to examine each project with respect to its environmental
impact.
