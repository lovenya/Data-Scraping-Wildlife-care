India alarm over rising tiger deaths


Â 
14th July 2017

Wildlife activists have accused Indian authorities of a culture of secrecy around steadily rising tiger deaths.

At least 67 tigers have died this year - many as a result of conflict with humans, including poachers, they say.

"There is no transparency in these matters," Theodore Baskaran, a former trustee of WWF-India, told the BBC.

India
is home to 60% of the world's tigers but they face increasing habitat
loss and demand for their body parts in China and other parts of Asia.

Senior
officials of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) confirmed
to the BBC that the bodies of 58 tigers had been recovered between
January and June this year, as well as body parts from nine other tiger
fatalities.

Karnataka state in the south recorded 14 deaths,
more than any other, while the central state of Madhya Pradesh
accounted for 13.

"Wildlife activists are alarmed mainly because
of the secrecy surrounding the deaths. Also there is no co-ordination
between researchers and the forest department," Theodore Baskaran said.
