30 May 2021

A male
Royal Bengal tiger, which had strayed from the core forest area, died
on Sunday while being taken to the Sajnekhali camp of Sunderbans for
treatment, a senior Forest department official said.

The Forest
department said the cause of death of the tiger did not appear to be
cyclone Yaas and its aftermath but old age, while adding that a
post-mortem of the carcass would confirm the real reason.

The
big cat, aged about 11-12 years, was found wobbling around Harikhali
camp the day before and the forest staff kept a close watch on it,
Chief Wildlife Warden V K Yadav told PTI.

As the tiger was later
found lying on the banks of a pond, the staff tried to feed it chicken
on Sunday morning but it refused the food.

The tiger appeared to
be very weak even to have water as forest personnel struggled to pour
water into its throat and was later being taken to the Sajnekhali
forest camp for treatment when it died on way, Yadav said. Adding the
post-mortem would reveal the exact reason.
