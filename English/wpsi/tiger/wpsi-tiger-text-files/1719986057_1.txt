Dehradun,
June 1 -The tenth tiger death that took place in the Jim Corbett
National Park Landscape yesterday was a result of an attempted
poaching. The post-mortem report of the dead eight-year-old tiger today
confirmed that injuries on its neck were caused by a snare. Till
yesterday, the forest authorities of the Ramangar division, where the
tiger death took place, were attributing the death to a struggle for
territory between two tigers.

A joint team of veterinarians,
comprising Rajeev Singh, RK Pathak and Dinesh Arya, who conducted the
post-mortem examination, confirmed the injury marks on the neck of the
tiger were caused by a snare. The team has also sent the viscera of the
dead tiger to a higher centre. Ramanagar Divisional Forest Officer
Ravindra Juyal admitted that the tiger could have died after getting
stuck in a snare. He, however, said the snare could have been put up by
some villagers to trap a deer and not necessarily meant to target a
tiger.
