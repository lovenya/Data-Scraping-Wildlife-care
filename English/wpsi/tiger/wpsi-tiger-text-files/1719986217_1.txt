Even
as an ongoing probe has established the killing of at least five tigers
in Maharashtra and two in the adjoining parts of Madhya Pradesh this
year, Union Minister for Environment Jayanthi Natrajan is apparently
unaware of it.

While forest officials describe it as the
"biggest tiger poaching case" cracked in the state's history, Natrajan
told The Indian Express on Friday, "Which tiger poaching investigation
you are talking about? If there were to be such a serious case, I would
have been told about it by Rajesh Gopal (National Tiger Conservation
Authority's member-secretary). We are very sensitive to wildlife.
Recently, when some people killed a leopard in Uttarakhand, I sent a
team there to investigate. And tiger is our flagship animal. We will do
everything to protect it."

While two tigers were poached in
Melghat, one is now confirmed to have been killed in the new
Umred-Karandla sanctuary in Nagpur district another one near Tumsar in
the proximity of Nagzira Sanctuary in Gondia district. One was killed
at an unknown place by poacher Keru Rajgond.

Sixteen people have so far been arrested in these cases.

Last
month, Surajbhan alias Sarju, a wildlife trader, was arrested by Delhi
Police, which reportedly seized from him five skins he had sourced from
Ramtek near here on May 30.
