Caught on camera: A poacher sneaks into Orang

Guwahati,
Jan. 13: Camera traps, which up to now have clicked pictures of
wildlife in Assam, have now for the first time taken pictures showing
poachers at Orang National Park.

Revealing this at a news
conference today, Assam principal chief conservator of forests
(wildlife), Suresh Chand, said pictures taken by camera traps hung on
trees have been able to take pictures of a group of poachers who had
killed a rhino on January 9. “Cameras which were placed in the trees
got the pictures of poachers who were moving in the area. The poachers
had come with an intent to kill a rhino,” Chand said.

The poachers were carrying .303 rifles.

Camera
trapping is being done by Aaranyak, a wildlife NGO, at Orang National
Park for tiger estimation. Around 70 cameras have been put up at
strategic locations in the park.

Chand said the poachers, who
are believed to be the same, came on January 5. They, however,
succeeded in killing a rhino on January 9. Chand said on January 9, the
poachers had changed their route and were successful in killing the
rhino.
