NAGPUR:
With 94 tiger and 310 leopard deaths in the last six months, an alarm
is being raised over the rise in numbers. During the same period last
year, 56 tiger deaths were recorded as per the data recorded by the
official website of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).

A
review of half-yearly data compiled by Wildlife Protection Society of
India (WPSI), an NGO working to combat wildlife trade and law
enforcement, shows the increase in deaths is shocking as overall tiger
deaths in 2020 were 109 while those of leopards 653. “With six months
still to go, the number of deaths may further go up,” says Nitin Desai,
Central India director of WPSI.

The figure of 94 tiger deaths in the last six months is quite high.
