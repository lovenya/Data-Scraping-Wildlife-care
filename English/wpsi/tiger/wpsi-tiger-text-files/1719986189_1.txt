NEW
DELHI: Tigers and leopards, accorded highest protection under the
Wildlife Act, may now be killed with due permission from authorities if
they pose a threat to human life or are disabled or diseased beyond
recovery.

This is part of new guidelines issued by the National
Tiger Conservation Authority in the wake of increased incidents of
man-animal conflicts.

"Tiger as well as leopard are categorized
under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, with highest
statutory protection against hunting under Section 9 (1) of the said
Act.

"Hence, such species can be killed if they become dangerous
to human life or are so disabled/diseased beyond recovery," the
guidelines for declaration of big cats as 'man-eaters' state.

As
both tigers and leopards are known to turn into man-eaters, "such
confirmed 'man-eaters' should be eliminated as per the statutory
provisions provided in Section 11 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act,
1972."

The guidelines state that the chief wildlife warden of a
state alone has the authority to permit hunting of animals which have
become dangerous to human life or disabled or diseased beyond recovery.

As
per the statutory requirement, a chief wildlife warden has to give in
writing the reasons for permitting elimination before hunting, they say.

According
to the NTCA, there are several reasons for a big cat to get habituated
as a 'man-eater' including disability due to old age, incapacitation
due to serious injury or loss of its canines, among others.

"However,
there may be several exceptions, and hence specific reasons have to be
ascertained on a case-to-case basis," the NTCA said.
