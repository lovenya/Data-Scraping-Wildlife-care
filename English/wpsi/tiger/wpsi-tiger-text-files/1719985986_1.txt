THE TRUTH ABOUT TIGERS - A film by Shekar Dattatri
 



The
Truth About Tigers is an unflinching look at the ground realities that
prevail in India's forests.  It’s a film that tells it like it is;
it is a must see for all those who are interested in helping to save
our national animal.  The film guides the viewer through the life
of the tiger, from birth to death, clearly explaining the reasons why
tigers are declining.  More importantly, it provides pointers on
what the government should do to reverse the decline, and what ordinary
citizens can meaningfully do to contribute. An accompanying website, www.truthabouttigers.org provides additional information on tigers and their conservation.

The
film was made by award-winning wildlife and conservation filmmaker,
Shekar Dattatri. Two years in the making, the film combines stunning
footage shot by some of the world’s leading cinematographers with deep
insights from experts such as renowned tiger biologist Dr. Ullas
Karanth of the Wildlife Conservation Society, and wildlife crime
fighter, Belinda Wright of the Wildlife Protection Society of India.
