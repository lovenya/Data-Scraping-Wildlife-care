Expressing
concern over the death of a tiger and trapping of another by poachers’
snares, activists have raised several questions over neglect of basic
standard operating procedures (SOPs) and non-use of available resources
like metal detectors.

Kishore Rithe, Member of State Wildlife
Board, in a letter to Principal Secretary (Forest) Pravin Pardeshi has
said: “The Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) had donated metal
detectors to Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). I request you to
initiate an inquiry into where these detectors were kept and what was
the mechanism in place to use the detectors in patrolling.”

Rithe
further says: “If the inquiry reveals that the detectors were either
not used or were not useful as per the opinion of staff, it must be
found out whether it was informed to the donor that they are of no use.
This is simply ignoring the seriousness, efforts and sentiments of
donor agencies and individuals by government system,” he said.

Nitin
Desai of Wildlife Protection Society of India and a wildlife crime
expert says, “It is possible to detect the traps even without using
metal detectors. Poachers normally block all tracks leading to the spot
they fix the snares except those on which they fix the snares.
