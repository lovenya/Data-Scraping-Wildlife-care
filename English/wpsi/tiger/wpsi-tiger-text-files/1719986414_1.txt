Nagpur: Even as the death of three tiger cubs by the speeding
Chanda Fort-Gondia passenger train on Thursday in Chichpalli
(Chandrapur district) is a grim reminder of how linear projects are
killing the country’s wildlife, experts warned of more such incidents
considering the proposed expansion of railway network in Central India
that threatens to cut at least 13 tiger corridors across 23 tiger
reserves.
Wildlife experts state Indian Railways have taken up
trebling of railway line network sans mitigation measures which will
cut multiple corridors in Central Indian Tiger Landscape (CITL). A
third line to be added to major trunk routes threatens the viability of
tigers in CITL.

While the third line work of section through
Ratapani wildlife sanctuary in MP has been cleared with mitigation
measures by the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), such planning
during expansion for other lines still remains a grey area.

Indian
Railways is on a massive expansion of railway network to add third
lines with an aim to increase freight and passenger traffic. Third
lines are being laid between Delhi-Chennai and Mumbai-Howrah route.
Both these lines pass through Nagpur and cut across major swathes of
forests in Central India.
