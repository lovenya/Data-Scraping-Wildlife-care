1st March 2019


In
the second week of February 2019, the presence of a tiger was confirmed
in the Mahisagar area of Gujarat but the happiness was short lived as
the big cat was found dead few days ago which is within a month of its
discovery in the area.

According to news reports, the presence
of tiger was confirmed in Gujarat’s Mahisagar area on February 12 which
shares the border with Rajasthan and is quite close to Madhya Pradesh
in the first week of February 2019 when a school teacher near Boriya
village in Mahisagar district saw the tiger crossing the road.

He
clicked the picture, shared it and it quickly became viral following
which Gujarat’s forest department used camera traps to ascertain the
big cat’s presence. The camera trap captured photos and videos of the
tiger establishing his presence. The news of the presence of the big
cat in the area was significant as it was nearly after three decades
(after the mid-1980s) that tigers were spotted in Gujarat making it the
only state to have three big cats – lions, tigers, and leopards.
