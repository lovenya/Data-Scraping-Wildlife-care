Injured tigress dies after being tranquilised in Tipeshwar 

 

19th March 2019


An
ailing tigress carrying a nylon wire noose around her neck for more
than a year died during a rescue operation near Tipeshwar Wildlife
Sanctuary in Yavatmal district on Sunday. T4, aged around 4.5 years,
had not been seen for the past ten months in the area – on the fringes
of Tipeshwar.

“On Sunday, two forest staffers had gone to fix
cameras at a spot for monitoring of two recently radio-collared
Tipeshwar tigers. Soon, they noticed T4 at just about 10 feet distance.
They climbed up a tree and watched her. They noticed that she had
become very weak and could hardly move,” said Tipeshwar divisional
Forest Officer Pramod Panchbai.

Panchbai further said upon
getting the news, he left for Nagpur with a veterinarian. “I directed
them to call a rescue van from Pandharkawada to try and rescue her. I
also started from Nagpur along with veterinarian Chetan Patond. After
the rescue van reached the spot, our staff felt she could probably be
caught in a net. But even in her bad condition, she attacked one of the
staffers, a guide called Guddu, who received injuries on his wrist,” he
said.
