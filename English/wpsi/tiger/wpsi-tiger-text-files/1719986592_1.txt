Development
is a sign of progress but when it impedes the natural habitat of a
living being it definitely needs a rethink. Time and again, we get to
hear of stories where animals are either hit by trains or by cars while
they are trying to cross the roads. In yet another tragic incident, a
pregnant tigress was crushed to death by a speeding vehicle on
Ramnagar-Haldwani road in Chunakha area of Terai West forest division
of Kumaon, a report in the Times of India stated.

As per the
post mortem report, the tigress was carrying three foetuses and was
around nine-years-old. "Losing a tigress that was expecting three cubs
to a road accident is absolutely shocking, and we have directed the
concerned officials to identify the vehicle so that the culprit can be
punished", Chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department,
Rajiv Bhartari, said as quoted to as saying by TOI.
