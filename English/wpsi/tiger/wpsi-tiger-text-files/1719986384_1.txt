New Study Shows Over a Third of Protected Areas Surveyed are Severely at Risk of Losing Tigers


 
28th Feb., 2018


A
new survey of over a hundred tiger conservation areas, where an
estimated 70 percent of the world’s wild tigers live, found that only
13 percent of them are able to meet global standards. At least
one-third of them are severely at risk of losing their tigers.
Alarmingly, most of these sites are in Southeast Asia, where tigers
have suffered the most dramatic decline in the past decade.

Reassuringly,
two-thirds of the areas surveyed reported fair to strong management.
Yet, basic needs such as enforcement against poaching, engaging local
communities and managing conflict between people and wildlife, remain
weak for all areas surveyed.

“Ineffective management of tiger
conservation areas leads to tiger extinction. To halt and reverse the
decline of wild tigers, effective management is thus the single most
important action. To achieve this, long-term investment in tiger
conservation areas is absolutely essential, and this is a
responsibility that must be led by tiger range governments,” said S.P
Yadav, Assistant Secretary General, Global Tiger Forum.

The
survey, driven by 11 leading conservation organizations and tiger range
governments that are part of the CA|TS Partnership, is the first and
largest rapid assessment of site-based tiger conservation across Asia.
