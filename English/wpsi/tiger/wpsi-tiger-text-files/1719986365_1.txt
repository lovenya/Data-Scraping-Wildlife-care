KOLKATA:
For the second year in a row, tiger population in the Indian Sunderbans
has shown an increase. This year, a camera-trap exercise has captured
at least six more tigers in the mangroves.
According to a forester
associated with the exercise, 87 unique frames were captured by the
camera traps in the mangroves, including the tiger reserve area and the
South 24-Parganas forest division. The count was 81 last year. The
latest exercise was conducted between December 2016 and June this year.

Eighty-seven
unique frames means the mangroves is home to at least 87 tigers, with
the possibility of more big cats being present, said the forester.
“It’s not possible to photograph all the tigers in a forest,” he said.

While the mean figure is yet to be analysed, officials expect the number to be around 90 this time, compared to last year’s 86.
