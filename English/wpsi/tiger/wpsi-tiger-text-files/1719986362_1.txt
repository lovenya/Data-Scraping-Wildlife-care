India to get new tiger hubs, rise in big cat population expected

Â 

4th June, 2017


For many tiger lovers wandering across India's 50-odd national
parks to get a glimpse of the majestic big cats without success, there
is good news. Next opening of the park gates may bring to you a louder
roar of the felines.

If the National Tiger Conservation
Authority (NTCA), the apex body formulating policies for the
conservation of big cats, is to be believed, then the next tiger census
due in 2018 is set to show a "significant rise". The last census done
in 2014 put the tiger number at 2,226 and this is set to touch 2,600 or
more by the 2018 tigers census, says NTCA chief Dr Debabrata Swain.
"Going by the estimated annual growth of 6-7 per cent of tigers being
added to current population and the same being corroborated by the
ongoing field census by our experts and scientists on ground, about
2,650 tigers could be a reality in 2018," says Dr Swain, who is also
the additional director general of Project Tiger.

A top NTCA
insider explained the encouraging trend. "We conduct the phase 4
exercise towards the end of every census done once in four years, the
last was done in 2014. We have fairly good scientific and tech-enabled
evidence gathered from the ongoing study, which started in October
2016, showing a possible significant rise in tiger population and there
are certain reserves showing proof of 'sizeable big cats population' by
next census due in 2018.
