NEW
DELHI: Notorious poacher and wildlife smuggler Sansar Chand, often
termed as "the Veerapan of North India" was today granted bail by a
Delhi court in a 2005 case, involving violation of the Wildlife Act.

Additional
Sessions Judge Pawan Kumar Jain granted bail to Sansar Chand, who is
currently lodged in a Jaipur jail in Rajasthan for various other
wildlife offences.

Chand was arrested in June 2005 by Delhi Police from Paharganj area here after which the CBI had taken him in the custody.

During
his interrogation, Chand had provided several clues to the CBI and also
pointed at the existence of an organised crime syndicate engaged in a
large-scale operation across various wildlife sanctuaries across the
country.

The agency subsequently in 2005 had chargesheeted him
under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA),
a first against any wildlife criminal.

Sansar Chand was granted
bail on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 and one surety of the same amount.
He, however, would not be out of jail owing to several other cases
pending against him in other courts.

He is an accused in numerous cases under the Wildlife Protection Act for poaching of tigers in the Sariska tiger reserve.

The
ASJ granted bail to him after his counsel Pramod Dubey submitted that
he has been in jail for over six years while the maximum punishment
under the Wildlife Act itself is seven years.

His bail plea was
opposed by the CBI on the ground that he has been charged under MCOCA.
The court, however, said mere pendency of MCOCA case cannot be a ground
for denying bail.
