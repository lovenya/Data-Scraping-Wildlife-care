Seven
notorious poachers, including Tota Ram Bawaria, were arrested on Monday
in a joint operation by the Forest Department and Champawat police SOG
for poaching a tiger in Uttarakhand a few days ago.

According to
the State Forest and Environment Advisory Committee vice-chairman Anil
Baluni, the bones of the tiger poached were also recovered from Tota
Ram who had made a deal with a Nepal resident for the tiger skin.

The
trap, weapons and tools used for poaching and skinning the tiger were
also recovered from them after they were nabbed from different
locations in the Terai. On October 14, the department personnel had
discovered the skin of a freshly poached tiger in the Sharda range near
Tanakpur, following which the authorities had launched a manhunt for
the poachers.

According to Baluni Tota Ram and his son Ram
Chander played the main role in the tiger poaching, along with Naresha,
Hasim Gujjar, his son Yakub and Karim who were all arrested on Monday.
