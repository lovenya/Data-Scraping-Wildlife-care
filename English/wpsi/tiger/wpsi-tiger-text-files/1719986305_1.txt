DEHRADUN:
A day after the special task force (STF) of Uttarakhand police seized
the skins of five big cats from a gang of poachers, a red alert was
issued in the entire Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR). It also emerged that
the state forest department, which went into a huddle soon after what
was being called as "the biggest seizures", had prior information about
Bawaria gang operating in CTR.

"We had provided specific
intelligence inputs to both forest department and STF. We also took the
police team to the spot where the Bawaria gang was hiding," Tito
Joseph, program manager of Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI),
said.

Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) DVS
Khati admitted that the forest department had information about the
Bawaria gang and its operations in Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand principal
chief conservator of forests Rajender Kumar Mahajan too expressed deep
concern over the recent unprecedented incidents of poaching in the
state.

"While the police has gained expertise in dealing with
such cases, the forest department hasn't. The department has somehow
confined itself to forestry and conservation works. Wildlife protection
is equally important. Forest department staff must be trained to deal
with this issue," said Joseph.
