Electric fences killing tigers in Maharashtra 


 
18th November 2017

The
electrocution of a tigress in the Chimur forest range in Chandrapur
district of Maharashtra on November 7 brings the tiger death toll due
to electrocution in the Vidarbha area alone to five this year.

Why are tigers dying?

In
a desperate attempt to prevent herbivores like nilgai (blue bulls) and
wild boar from destroying their crops, farmers often set up illegal
high-voltage electrical fences around their fields drawing power from
electrical lines meant for home or agricultural use. Tigers, which use
human-dominated landscapes including agricultural fields to move about,
die when they come in contact with these fences. In some places,
poachers erect live wiretraps using overhead 11 kv lines to kill
animals, says Nitin Desai, director (central India) of the Wildlife
Protection Society of India, an NGO that operates in the area. “This is
fatal to any animal that comes in contact with it and is generally done
at night,” he points out.
