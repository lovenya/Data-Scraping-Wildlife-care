A
carcass of a tiger was found deep inside the forests of the Western
Ghats in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Goa prompting a probe by the
Forest department.

Chief Wildlife Warden for Goa Santosh Kumar
said the cause of death was not immediately known. “Our team is at the
site . At this moment, I cannot say more regarding the reasons behind
this until I speak to the team when they return. After that we will get
a post mortem done,” Kumar said.

Sources have revealed that the tiger could have been poisoned to death.

Back
in 2009, a tiger was killed after it was ensnared in a trap set by
villagers to catch wild boar and later shot dead to put it out of its
misery leading to the arrest of five villagers.
