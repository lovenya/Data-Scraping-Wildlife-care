NAGPUR:
Perturbed by the series of tiger deaths due to electrocution in the
past few weeks, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a
statutory body under MoEFCC to monitor all tiger reserves, has asked
all tiger range states to step up patrolling in buffer and fringe areas
of tiger reserves. They have also asked related agencies like police
and power supply companies to be involved in the activity.

Data
submitted by the states shows Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh top the
chart in tiger electrocution cases. According to NTCA, of the 33 tiger
deaths due to electrocution in the last nine years beginning January
2012, MP reported 20 deaths followed by Maharashtra 10, and Telangana,
Karnataka, and Odisha one each.

However, Maharashtra has put its
figure on the lower side. As per the data collected by Wildlife
Protection Society of India (WPSI), an NGO working to tackle growing
wildlife crime, in the last five years (2016-20), 18 tigers and 18
leopards have been electrocuted in Maharashtra with the latest one in
Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) landscape in Gondia on November
16.
