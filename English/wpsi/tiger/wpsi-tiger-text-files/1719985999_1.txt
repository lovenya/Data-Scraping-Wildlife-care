Tehelka Magazine, Vol 7, Issue 51, Dated December 25, 2010More depressing news on tigers - a sting conducted near the Indo-Nepal border by Tehelka maagzine:

"A
TIGHTLY knit cross-country poaching network straddling China, Nepal and
India is depleting India’s forests of its magnificent wildlife,
especially its tigers. A tiger is killed every two weeks in India. A
leopard is killed and skinned every day. Several foxes and otters are
ruthlessly hunted down every day for their fur. To deconstruct this
story, the TEHELKA team went on a dangerous mission, posing as the
Delhi agents of a tiger skin buyer."
