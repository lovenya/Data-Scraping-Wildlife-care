RANCHI: The state forest department here is facing acute shortage of field staff, while it has 20 chief conservator of forests.

Sources
in forest department said, in mid-1970s there used to be one chief
conservator of forest, who managed the entire state. To assist him,
there were middle-level officers and an army of forest guards and
rangers.

"At present over 80% post of forest guards and rangers
are vacant but instead of appointing them, the state government has
notified appointment of 20 officers in the rank of chief conservator of
forests to supervise various projects," said sources.

An officer
in the department confided that when there is no one to protect the
forest at the lowest level, then appointment at senior positions is of
no use. The cadre strength of Indian Forest Service (IFS) was also
recently increased from 130 to 145.

There are just 950 forest
guards in the state against sanctioned strength of 3,368 and 530
rangers against total post of 1062. "If the forest department will not
appoint these officers at the lowest level then days are not far off
when there will be no jungle and managers will sit in their air
conditioned offices with no work in hand," said an officer.
