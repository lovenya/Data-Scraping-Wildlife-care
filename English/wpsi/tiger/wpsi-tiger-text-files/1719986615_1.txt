Park in Peril — Proposed Highway Through Pakke Tiger Reserve, Arunachal Pradesh

 

2 Mar 2020



The
future of the Pakke Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh is threatened by
a proposal to construct a two-lane Highway through it. The proposed
road, from Seijosa, Pakke Kessang district to Bhalukpong, West Kameng
district would form part of the 692 km long East-West Industrial
Corridor project that seeks to connect towns/villages in the foothill
areas of Arunachal Pradesh, from Kanubari in the east to Bhairabkund in
the west.

In Phase I of the proposed project, the developers /
state government are planning to connect Pasighat in central Arunachal
to Bhairabkund in the west. A section of the highway is to pass through
Pakke Tiger Reserve, one of the best managed Protected Areas in
Arunachal Pradesh, causing severe disruption and permanent
fragmentation. 48.8 km of the highway is proposed as an elevated
corridor through the Tiger Reserve, at an estimated cost of Rs. 2452.8
crores.
