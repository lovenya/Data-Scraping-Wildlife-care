BHOPAL:
After keeping in enclosure for more than 40 days, translocated
Bandhavgarh tigress Sundari was released in Satkoshia Tiger Reserve by
the authorities there.Madhya
Pradesh government was in a fix over further translocation of the
tigress as a wildlife activist had shot a complaint to National Tiger
Conservation Authority(NTCA) accusing Odisha forest officials of
subjecting Sundari to undue hardships by keeping her in an enclosure
for over a month.

The tigress was released under supervision of the top wildlife officials of the Odisha government, said sources.

"She
would not have been able to hunt in the wild if she was kept in
enclosure for more days. Now that it has been released I would appeal
Satkoshia authorities to ensure its safety. State government’s decision
to gift our tigers to Odisha was not good," said wildlife activist Ajay
Dubey.
