28 April 2023First
a camera trap captured an adult tiger sauntering in Himachal Pradesh.
Now the tiger, seems the similar one, has been caught on camera,
raising hopes of wildlife enthusiasts to work on establishing a
multistate tiger reserve comprising Rajaji Uttarakhand, Kalesar in
Haryana and Simbalbara in Himachal Pradesh.

Haryana Forests and
Wildlife Minister Kanwar Pal on Thursday said a tiger was caught on a
camera trap in April in state's Kalesar National Park, the first
sighting in the area in 110 years.

"It is a proud moment for the
state as the tiger was seen in the Kalesar area after 110 years. The
last sighting was reported in 1913," Kanwar Pal wrote on his Facebook
post. He also tagged two pictures of the wild cat.
