SHAHJAHANPUR:
A day after an adult male tiger - caught in a poacher’s snare - died
during a botched rescue operation, investigating officer and field
director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve Ramesh Pandey on Thursday arrested six
accused, including a forest beat watcher.
Investigation revealed
that the tiger was trapped on Tuesday midnight and local forest
officials from Maheshpur range of Lakhimpur Kheri district sought the
help of rescue team almost 10 hours after the incident.

Poachers
had installed the snare near a wheat field in connivance with the
watcher to trap a wild boar. But when the tiger was trapped, the
watcher did not share any information with senior officials which
delayed the rescue operation, says investigation report.
