NAGPUR:
Tadoba's legendary tigress Maya (T-12), who ruled the park for 13
years, is feared dead. Foresters who launched a combing operation to
search for the missing tigress found a skeleton in compartment number
82 on Saturday morning.

                        

The remains of a tiger skeleton scattered over a 100m radius were
collected for DNA analysis by wildlife veterinarians and biologists for
analysis.

                        

The body parts were in a very advanced stage of decomposition and not
fit for autopsy.

                        

Well-known wildlife cinematographer and filmmaker Subbiah Nallamuthu,
who filmed Maya and contributed to TOI's Tiger Anthem, said, "The body
parts are of a tigress and it could be Maya. How it happened is a
mystery but it could be a fallout of a territorial fight. Maya will
always be in our memories."
