Â 
Nov.25, 2010

In
a remarkable followup to the arrest of tiger-poaching kingpin, Shalik
Gedam, on 19th November, a complete skeleton of a tiger was recovered
yesterday from Doni Nala, on the boundary of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger
Reserve in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra. 

The Forest
Department team was led to the spot by Shalik Gedam. Along with the
tiger skeleton, a skull, four canines and a claw were recovered. The
team was led by Mr. Dhabekar, Assistant Conservator of Forests,
Chandrapur Division, accompanied by a field officer from the Wildlife
Protection Society of India (WPSI). 

A resident of Doni village
in Chandrapur district, Shalik Gedam is an accused in a case dating
back to March 2009, when tiger claws were recovered from three of his
alleged accomplices based on information provided by WPSI. Shalik Gedam
had been absconding for the past 20 months, until he was arrested last
Friday on further information provided by WPSI (see full story below).
Upon interrogation, Gedam allegedly confessed to having killed a male
tiger in October-November 2008. This lead to the recovery of the
skeleton yesterday. 

The information that led to the arrest and
the recovery of the tiger skeleton, was developed through a Secret
Information Reward Scheme which is being run by WPSI in collaboration
with the Maharashtra Forest Department in the Tadoba landscape.

According to WPSI's Wildlife Crime Database, 27 tiger deaths are attributable to poaching or seizures so far in India in 2010.
