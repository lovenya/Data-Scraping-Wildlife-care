CHANDRAPUR/NAGPUR:
A tigress was founddead and its sub-adult cub has been traced close by
on the premises of Lohara teak research centre, 3km from Chandrapur, on
Sunday.

This is the second tiger death in a month in the
district. On January 23, a full-grown tiger was electrocuted in Zaran
in FDCM area near Chandrapur.

The tigress seems to have died
after being hit by an unidentified vehicle while crossing the road.
Experts say the spot seems to be a favourite crossing as a tigress had
met the same fate in February 2006.

Senior officials confirmed
presence of a cub nearby, who is unable to stand on its legs after the
accident. "The cub, suspected to be sub-adult, is in a state of shock.
We are closely monitoring movement of the cub and have installed camera
traps. A bait has also been tied near the cub. A search of the area has
revealed that there is only one cub," they said. However, experts
suspect that there might be another cub which must have moved ahead.

On
Sunday, patrolling staff of the teak centre noticed carcass of the
tigress in compartment no. 397 close to the Chandrapur-Mul road. It
took more than five hours for the senior officers ofChandrapur circle
to reach the spot after the carcass was noticed.

A visit to the
spot revealed that the carcass was fresh and blood was oozing out from
the nose and the right hind limb was slashed. The 8-year-old beast may
have died early in the morning.

"All the body parts of the
tigress are intact and hence possibility of poaching is ruled out,"
officials said. The big cat was 2.40 metres in length and 94cm in
height.

Sources claimed that the tigress had its location in the
teak research nursery and forest around. The tigress had a 20-cm-long
gash in the right hind limb. A deep cut ripped the skin revealing bone
close to the claw.
