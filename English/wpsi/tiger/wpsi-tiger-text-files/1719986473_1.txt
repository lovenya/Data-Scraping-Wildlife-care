Tigers killing and eating elephants in Corbett National Park: Government study reveals worrying phenomenon

 

16 June 2019

NEW DELHI:
Tigers have been found to be killing elephants, mainly young ones, in
the famed Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and in a few cases
eating them too, according to an official study.

The findings,
which is a part of the study conducted by the park authority, signals a
worrying trend in wildlife as tigers usually don't eat elephants,
wildlife experts say.

A total of nine tigers, 21 elephants and
six leopards were found dead from 2014 to May 31, 2019, due to
infighting and clashes over issues related of mating, according to the
study.
"Out of the total 36 cases for the three species, 21 were
reported in case of wild elephants alone. However, a very surprising
aspect was that around 60 per cent of wild elephant death cases (13)
were due to attack by tigers mostly on young ones," it said.

Senior
IFS officer and in-charge of the national park, Sanjiv Chaturvedi said
the phenomenon of tigers eating elephants is unique.
