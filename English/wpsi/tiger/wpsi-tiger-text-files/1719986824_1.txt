A
tiger that was camera-trapped in Toda Reserve Forest under the Bonai
Division of Sundargarh reportedly walked over 1000 kilometres to
establish its new territory. 

                        

According to the Forest Department sources, the big cat has migrated
from Sanjay Dubri Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh to Toda Reserve
Forest. On its way to Odisha, it has passed through three tiger
sanctuaries and corridors of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. 

                        

It was the Bonai DFO who first informed about this tiger being tracked
through camera. 

                        

Though it has been in Toda Reserve Forest for a year now, it had not
been caught by cameras. After it was camera-trapped, the Tiger cell of
NTCA reportedly confirmed its presence.
