BAREILLY:
Razor wires put up by poachers to trap wild boar, deer and blue bulls
-- nilgai -- for their meat ensnared a full-grown tiger on Sunday night
and led to its painful and agonising death in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri
district, which has already seen at least five big cat killings in the
last two years. The region, sources claim, has turned into a hotbed for
poachers. In March, 2019, a big cat was killed just 12-km away from the
spot where the adult male tiger’s bloodied carcass was recovered on
Monday morning.

Abutting Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, the district’s
lush sugarcane fields have become a refuge for stray tigers. In a
recent survey using camera traps, the presence of over 10 tigers was
confirmed in the forests of Mohammadi range of social forestry. But it
has also exposed them to villagers and poachers amid them. Sources said
that the poachers trap and kill wild boar and ‘nilgai’ for their meat
which fetches them somewhere between Rs 400 and 500 per kg.
