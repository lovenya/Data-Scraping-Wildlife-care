NEW
DELHI: In view of increasing cases of tigers straying from protected
areas, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) chief Rajesh
Gopal has suggested restricting the movement of people by imposing
Section 144 CrPC on such tracts to avoid lethal man-animal encounters. 

Lawyers
handling wildlife cases have given a thumbs-up to the "pro-conservation
advisory" but doubted if it could be smoothly implemented as the
Section, which also allows for preventive detention, is usually
enforced as a precautionary measure against untoward incidents like
riots or protests. 

The suggestion came in the wake of
increasing cases of tiger straying particularly in Uttar Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Maharashtra where due to a mob frenzy either the locals
get killed by the straying animal or vice-versa, threatening the
conservation efforts. 

Lamenting that such moving tigers get
"branded" as "man-eaters" and eventually land in 'zoos' or get
eliminated, Gopal stressed on a need to address the issue actively at
the ground level with enforcement of Section 144 CrPc being one of the
solution.
