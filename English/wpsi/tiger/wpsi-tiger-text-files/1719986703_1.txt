Walk to remember: Tiger covers 100km in 4 months to reach Sundarbans in Bangladesh from Indian forest

 

7 June 2021

A tiger
which had been radio-collared in India was found to have travelled
around 100km to reach Sundarbans in Bangladesh over a period of four
months, West Bengal’s chief wildlife warden VK Yadav was quoted as
saying.

The male tiger was radio-collared in December 2020 to
enable foresters to track his movement patterns near human beings. He
was captured from Harinbhanga forest just opposite the Harikhali camp
under Bashirhat range in Bengal and later released with the satellite
collar on December 27, reports said.

His long and arduous journey to Bangladesh involved several hurdles including some rivers wider than a kilometre.
