NAGPUR:
Two young male tigers, one travelling 1,160km and another 450km, seem
to be among the longest distances covered by any individual tiger and
dispersal recorded by big cats. A radio-collared tiger C1 from
Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Pandharkawda in Yavatmal had stepped
out of the sanctuary in search of new territory on June 21, 2019.

C1
was one of three cubs of T1, a resident tigress of the park. It was
collared on February 27, 2019. It went out of the park on June 21 and
has so far travelled 1,160km and counting.
The tiger survived
getting entangled in a wire snare before collaring has covered six
districts in two states of Telangana and Maharashtra. It went towards
Painganga wildlife sanctuary and went towards Kawal tiger reserve in
Telangana.

After exploring areas near Kawal, C1 turned back and
went to Painganga followed by Isapur bird sanctuary, Pusad, Hingoli,
Washim and now Akola.
