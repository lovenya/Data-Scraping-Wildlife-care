Tiger numbers double since 2006 but no presence in three reserves: Census

 

30 July 2019



India’s
tiger population has jumped to an estimated 2,967, a rise by 33% over
2,226 reported in 2014. This is also an incredible 210% rise from 1,411
recorded in 2006, according to the all-India estimation — ‘Status of
Tigers, Co-predators, Prey and their Habitat, 2018’ — released by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.

Behind the big headline,
hidden in fine print is a discrepancy in methodology: In 2014, tigers
aged 1.5 years or older were counted. The current report has the
cut-off age as 1 year.

Principal scientists with Wildlife

comparable, how many tigers are in the 12-18 month age group in the
population of 2,967, and how the estimation determines the age of a
tiger.
