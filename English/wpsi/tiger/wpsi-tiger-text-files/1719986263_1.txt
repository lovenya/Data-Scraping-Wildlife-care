The
government on Wednesday announced a slew of measures to preserve the
country’s tiger population including use of drones to keep an eye on
poachers.

Introduction of e-surveillance is at the centre of the
government’s new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) announced by
Union Environment And Forests Minister Prakash Javadekar for the
management of the tiger habitat.  

As per the All India
Tiger Estimation Result 2014, India’s tiger population grew by around
30 percent from 1,706 in 2010 to 2,226 in 2014. There are 47 tiger
reserves spread across 17 states in the country. Despite the
significant increase in the species’ count, poaching remained a major
cause of worry for sustaining the tiger population in the country.

The
minister released the SOPs after interaction with chief wildlife
wardens of tiger range states and field directors of tiger reserves.
The National Tiger Conservation Authority devised the measures.

Besides e-surveillance, Javadekar said the government would soon set up a Special Task Force for rhinoceros.
