Nagpur
: The man-tiger conflict was reported from an entirely new area in
Vidarbha with a tigress and her two cubs killing and eating a farmer,
eight km from Tipeshwar Sanctuary in Yavatmal district, on Monday
afternoon.

Prahlad Madavi (55) was killed when the tigress
pounced upon him while he was plucking pulse legumes in his field.
Sources said, “The field is about 500 metres from the forest that is
contiguous with Tipeshwar Sanctuary, but eight km from the sanctuary
border.”

“The tigress was followed by her two cubs, aged about
18 months, and the three literally tore apart the farmer’s body and ate
it,” sources added. “The head, legs and hands were severed from the
body,” they said.

“The way this happened, it appears the tiger
family was very hungry, which in turn could be because of scarce or no
preybase in the area,” Central India director of Wildlife Protection
Society of India Nitin Desai said.
