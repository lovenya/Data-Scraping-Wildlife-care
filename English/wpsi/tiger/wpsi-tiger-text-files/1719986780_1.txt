No construction in core areas of tiger reserves, national parks: Supreme Court

 

9 Feb 2023The
Supreme Court on Wednesday banned all construction activities in the
core areas of tiger reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries
after it was brought to its notice by a court-appointed panel that
illegal constructions for establishment of a tiger safari was being
done within in the buffer area of the Corbett Tiger Reserve in
Uttarakhand.

A bench of Justices BR Gavai and Vikram Nath sought
response from the Centre and the National Tiger Conservation Authority
(NTCA) on the recommendation of SC-appointed central empowered
committee (CEC) to review guidelines for setting up of zoos and safaris
within tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries in India in order to
discourage tourism in wildlife habitat.
