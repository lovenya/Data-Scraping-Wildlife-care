The
Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the Union Environment Ministry has
put on hold the Odisha Mining Corporation’s (OMC) proposal seeking
diversion of dense forest land in the State’s Keonjhar district after
it found that the land in question is proposed to be a tiger corridor
connecting two tiger reserves — Similipal and Satkosia.

The FAC recommends clearances for projects on forest lands.

In
a meeting, the FAC noted the forest area that the OMC wants to be
diverted is of pristine nature with over 2,72,535 trees and is also the
proposed tiger corridor interlinking Similipal Tiger and Satkosia Tiger
Reserves which is crucial for long-term conservation tigers and
wildlife in the country.

Out of 846.3995 hectares forest land, the OMC sought diversion of 746.3325 ha.

As
per the minutes of the meeting, those opposing the mining project told
the FAC that the forest spread across Jajpur and Keonjhar districts is
home to dry deciduous Sal forests and has been identified as an
inviolate forest or no-go zone area mining projects.

The wildlife officers also brought to the notice of the FAC that the last tiger in these forests was seen in 1997.

The
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has identified the patch
as a tiger corridor which is crucial to connect source populations from
different protected areas for genetic exchange and for dispersal of the
wild cats.Read full story here
