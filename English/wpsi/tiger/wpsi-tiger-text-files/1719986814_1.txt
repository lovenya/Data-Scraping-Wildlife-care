The Sikkim forest and environment
department has claimed that a royal Bengal tiger and a gaur, photos of
which have been recently clicked by trap cameras in the upper reaches
of the state, have set new national and world records.

                        

Sources said that the photo of a tiger was clicked at an elevation of
3,966 metres from sea level, making it a national record, and that of a
gaur at a height of 3,568 metres, making it a world record.

                        

Sources in the Sikkim forest department said along with the Wildlife
Institute of India, they had installed trap cameras in high-altitude
regions of the Himalayan state “to understand the impact of climate
change on large mammals”.
