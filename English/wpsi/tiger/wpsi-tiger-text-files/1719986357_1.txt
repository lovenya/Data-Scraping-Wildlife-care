Debate: Will the Govt Use the New Method for Counting Tigers?

 

12th Apr., 2017



Researchers at the Indian Statistical Institute, Bengaluru, and
the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) have come up with a new
methodology that has the potential to revolutionise the way tigers and
other big animals are counted over large geographical areas.

How many tigers are there in India?
According
to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, in 2006,
the number was estimated at 1,411 and in 2010 it was 1,706. In 2016,
the world rejoiced when India announced that it had nearly 2,500
members of this critically endangered big cat.

However, there were many who were not sure of this.

The
methods used to count tigers do not measure up to rigorous scientific
scrutiny but the country’s big cat conservation body the National Tiger
Conservation Agency (NTCA) brushed those objections under the carpet.
The new method is aimed at making the tiger count robust and reliable.
