WPSI, WSO and Aaranyak Recommendations on the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Bill 2013 
 
18.09.2013



"The
Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2013 has been introduced in the
Rajya Sabha to amend the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Bill
proposes increased penalties for offences, a new regulatory framework
for invasive and CITES listed species, and other changes to the Act.
There are, however, a few concerns with the Bill's provisions, which
WPSI, Wildlife Society of Orissa, and Aaranyak have jointly raised to
the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology,
Environment and Forests. A copy of our letter can be found at the link
below."
