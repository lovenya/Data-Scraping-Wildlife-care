Bhopal/ New Delhi:

Two
days after a massive forest fire broke out at the Bandhavgarh National
Park in Madhya Pradesh, efforts are still on to put out the blaze,
according to locals. Spread across an area of over 100 square km,
Bandhavgarh is one of the most popular national parks in India in the
Vindhya Hills of the Umaria district, about 470 km from state capital
Bhopal; it is known for Royal Bengal tigers.

The fire is
believed to have spread to several zones including one of the three
major zones- Magdi. Frightening visuals showed trees engulfed in blaze
and vast expanse of grasslands covered in plumes of smoke.

Inadequate
resources are believed to one of the reasons, sources said, that it's
taking so long to douse the forest fire. Locals have said the
authorities did not take timely action when the blaze broke out.
