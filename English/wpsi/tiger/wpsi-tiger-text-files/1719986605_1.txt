NAGPUR/CHANDRAPUR:
A collared tigress (E-4), whose GPS tracking signal broke down four
months ago, was found dead in Gadchiroli forest on Saturday morning
during a routine patrol.Last
sighted in December during a ground-tracking exercise, the
three-year-old tigress’s carcass was discovered in a decomposed
condition in the dense forest falling under the Chatgaon range. Post
mortem has ruled out foul play in the tigress’s death, which was
collared last year at Brahmapuri.

Chief conservator of forest
(CCF), Chandrapur, SV Ramarao said “The carcass seems to be at least
two weeks old but we can say that it was a natural death. The skin was
intact and no other body part was missing. The carcass was found deep
in the forest early in morning and we immediately moved our team
members to the spot.”
