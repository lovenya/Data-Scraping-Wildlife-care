The Moodie Davitt ‘Roarport’ Days 4 & 5: The team earn their stripes but not a tiger in sight

 

4 Aug. 2019



There
are 39 tiger reserves in India but arguably the most famous is Pench
Tiger Reserve in Seoni, a vast nature reserve that straddles the
central Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Besides
being one of the world’s most renowned tiger habitats, it is also among
India’s most important bird sanctuaries. The Pench Tiger Reserve and
the surrounding area were the original setting for Rudyard Kipling’s
famous work, The Jungle Book. Not surprisingly then, given that tiger
conservation is the prime motivation for the Wild Tiger Roar Trip,
Pench was a compulsory stop for the Roar Trip co-pilots Gautom Menon
and Paul George V.

Day 4 saw our intrepid duo make the ten-hour,
600km drive from Hyderabad to the tiger reserve. But first there was an
important stop in the city of Nagpur, two hours to the south of Pench.
There Gautom and Paul caught up with one of India’s most famous
wildlife conservationists, Nitin Desai (pictured below).

Desai
is Director, Central India with the Wildlife Protection Society of
India (WPSI). Having worked as a volunteer with the World Wildlife Fund
in 1987, he became increasingly concerned by the impact of poaching and
the illegal wildlife trade.
