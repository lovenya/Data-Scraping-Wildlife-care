Naxals trying to make inroads into tiger reserve area: cops

A
senior Naxal cadre has allegedly corroborated the police’s suspicion
that Naxals are trying to constitute a dalam (military unit) for
villages in and around the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR).

A
state committee (CPI-Maoist) member and secretary of Chandrapur Area
Committee, Bhimrao alias Bhanu alias Bhaskar Bhovte was arrested along
with his wife Sunanda alias Megha alias Vanaja Vasant Ramteke in Gondia
district a day before Home Minister P Chidambaram’s visit to Gadchiroli
in December last year.

“Bhovte told us that a survey was done in
TATR and surrounding villages in the recent past with the intention to
form a dalam,” a senior police officer said.

A series of raids
followed the couple’s arrests at the dens of Naxal activists in places
such as Mul and Sindewahi, situated near the tiger reserve.

Some
hand-written material, most of them survey reports, was seized. One of
the reports was about the survey in the tiger reserve.

“A
crackdown had ensued on some youth members of an organisation claiming
to be a students’ body in Chandrapur a few years ago. While many of the
youths, including some girls, had been deputed as dalam members under
the North Gadchiroli Gondia Committee of CPI(Maoist), some were engaged
by the Chandrapur Area Committee to work in the TATR landscape on
building a dalam, our interrogation has revealed,” the official said.

The
report mentions the “demarcation of a 8-km road from Mul to Somnath” (a
Shiv temple nestling in the north-eastern TATR fringe) and
“identification of our men in the villages along it.”
