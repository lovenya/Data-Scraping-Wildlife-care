Kolkata,
August 1 (PTI): The West Bengal forest department is bringing six
tigers to Buxa Tiger Reserve in Alipurduar district, as part of its
effort to augment the population of big cats in the national park, an
official said on Saturday.

The six big cats are being brought from Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Chief Wildlife Warden Ravikant Sinha told PTI.

“Arrangements have been made to ensure safe and smooth transit of the animals,” he said.

Sinha
said the government wanted to increase the population of Royal Bengal
tigers in BTR, the largest forest in North Bengal with an area of 745
sq-km.

“Recently, two Royal Bengal tigers have been spotted in
Buxa through our camera traps. These two big cats were seen from
various locations of the core area of the forest. So, at least two
tigers are there already and we need to raise the number,” Sinha said.
