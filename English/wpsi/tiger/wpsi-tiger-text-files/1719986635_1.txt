NTCA changes stripes, now cites lockdown for tiger report delay

 

25 May 2020



Nagpur:
Even after a delay of 10 months, the National Tiger Conservation
Authority (NTCA), a statutory body under MoEFCC (ministry of
environment, forest and climate change) monitoring all tiger reserves
in the country, has failed to release final All-India Tiger Estimation
(AITE) 2018 report.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi released
‘Status of tiger in India-2018’ report on July 28, 2019 (World Tiger
Day), NTCA-WII had promised to release the final report in a month with
figures of individual tiger reserves and clusters.

“If the
NTCA-WII did not have figures of individual tiger reserves, then how
did it arrive at the figure of 2,967 tigers in the country as per
AITE-2018, an increase by 33% from 2,226 tigers in 2014,” say wildlife
experts and independent scientists.

On December 17, TOI reported
how doubts were being raised over the increase in number of tigers and
time was being taken to revamp the report to substantiate its own
figures.The NTCA conducts tiger
estimation every four years. In 2014, the preliminary (summary) report
was released on January 20, 2015, and final report was quietly released
in March.
