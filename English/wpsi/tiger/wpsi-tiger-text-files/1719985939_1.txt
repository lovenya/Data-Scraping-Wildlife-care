Students from the British School Raise Funds for Tiger Conservation


April 28, 2010

Eight
young students from the British School in New Delhi, who call
themselves the ‘Tiger Club’, have raised Rs. 13,000 to help save wild
tigers. They presented their hard-earned funds to the Executive
Director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), Belinda
Wright, on Wednesday 21 April 2010.

Dalrymple, Belinda Wright, Kavan Sinha, Auustin Carre, Ronaldo Ngoga
and Weihan Soh.The funds were
raised by the Tiger Club in a four-day sale at their school. Three of
the students, Sam Dalrymple, Augustin Carre and Weihan Soh, made a
collection of Origami figures of dragons, phoenixes and roses, while
the others, Edward Grey, Eduard Lock Feixas, Kavan Sinha and Jai Singh,
made chocolate brownies and other items. Edward sold hand-made
postcards of tigers from photographs he had taken in Bandhavgarh Tiger
Reserve. After the boys approached WPSI with their fund raising plans,
WPSI encouraged the efforts of these enthusiastic young tiger
conservationists with pocket calendars, bookmarks, save-the-tiger
ribbons, and tiger badges.

Eminent tiger conservationist,
Belinda Wright, congratulated the Tiger Club for their remarkable
achievement and assured the students that their donation would be used
effectively in WPSI’s anti-poaching investigations and efforts to curb
the illegal trade in tiger parts.
