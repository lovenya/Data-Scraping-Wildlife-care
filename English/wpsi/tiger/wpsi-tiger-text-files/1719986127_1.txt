BHOPAL:
The Madya Pradesh government is likely to recommend a CBI probe into
the alleged disappearance and poaching of wild cats from Panna Tiger
Reserve based on a report submitted by sanctuary authorities.

Sources
said the report was submitted to the Madhya Pradesh government last
month after a year-long follow up by the state administration and the
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) with PTR over the issue.

They
said the report contained all necessary evidence and reasons for tiger
deaths and their disappearance from the reserve, adding the State may
recommend a CBI probe into at least three such cases between 2005 and
2009 in the PTR.

"The report has been submitted to the MP Forest
department, which is carrying out discussions with the Home Department
to decide on a CBI probe," a senior State government official said.

Various
social activists and wildlife experts had written to both the State and
Central governments to constitute a CBI inquiry into cases of tiger
death in PTR.
