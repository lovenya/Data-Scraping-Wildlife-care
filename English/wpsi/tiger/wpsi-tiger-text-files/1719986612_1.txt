Nagpur:
At a time insufficient mitigation measures on NH-44 (NH-7) near Pench
Tiger Reserve have come in for criticism, a report by Wildlife
Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, claims 11 individuals tigers are
using six of the nine wildlife underpasses.

The report, based on
one-year camera trap survey data from March-December 2019, states that
18 wild animal species, excluding rhesus macaque and grey langur, were
found using these underpasses. Over 5,450 wild animal captures were
recorded on camera traps in 10 months.

NH-7 has been in the news
for frequent wild animal deaths. In the latest, a leopard was knocked
dead on January 24 near Deolapar. In the last 15 months, three leopards
have been killed, and a tiger was recorded jumping over the crash
barrier to cross towards Pench Tiger Reserve.
