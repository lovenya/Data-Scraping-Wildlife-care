Experts blame human pressure for rising tiger kills in Sundarbans

Experts
say the rising count of people dying in tiger attacks in the swampy
marshland of Sundarbans in West Bengal is a result of human residents
pushing further into the big cats’ path.

Two women were killed
by tigers in Sundarbans in two days adding to the number of people
being mauled to death by the big cats to 11 since December 2018.

The
Sundarbans is spread over 16,900 sq km, two-thirds of which is in
Bangladesh. The archipelago comprising more than one hundred islands is
famous for the world’s largest mangrove forest and the Royal Bengal
Tiger. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.

topography of Sunderbans changed in 2009 when Cyclone Aila brought
giant waves that submerged the islands in brackish water, leaving
thousands of acres unfit for traditional rainwater farming.
