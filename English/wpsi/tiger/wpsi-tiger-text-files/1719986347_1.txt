As
Asian Luxury Market Grows, A Surge in Tiger Killings in India

From
1990 to 2013, the notorious tiger poacher Kuttu Bahelia and his
extended family — brothers, uncles, and their wives and children —
reportedly killed hundreds of tigers and leopards in the tiger-rich
Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, according to law
enforcement informants and media reports. “Even if half that [estimate]
is correct, it is still a very significant number,” says Belinda
Wright, who directs the non-profit Wildlife Protection Society of India
(WPSI). 



So there was relief when, after years of eluding the
police, Kuttu was arrested in 2015. He faced at least six counts of
tiger poaching in forests across the central state of Maharashtra and
was held without bail. On January 21, 2016, he was taken to court to
stand trial in the first of those cases, for allegedly poaching a pair
of tigers three years earlier. After his court appearance, while being
transported back to jail, he begged to make a restroom stop — and fled
into the forest, handcuffed, successfully evading his two police
escorts. 



Authorities launched a manhunt, but Kuttu — who is descended from a
long line of traditional hunters — had vanished.
