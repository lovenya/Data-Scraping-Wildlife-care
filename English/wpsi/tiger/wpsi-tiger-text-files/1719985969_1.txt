Bhopal
: A six-month old orphaned tiger cub, who had lost its mother to a car
accident earlier this year, was killed by a tiger who entered its
fenced enclosure, according to forest authorities at Bandhavgarh
National Park. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) H S Pabla
confirmed the death of one cub and said the cub’s two siblings were
found to be safe on Sunday evening.

The three cubs had been
orphaned when their mother got run over by a vehicle inside the park
and died a day later, on May 19. A National Tiger Conservation
Authority (NTCA) probe had revealed that the tigress was run over by
one of the two vehicles allowed inside the park after visiting hours,
on May 18. One vehicle, according to the probe, had forest officials
and the other had a local political leader.

The state government
had first claimed that a tourist vehicle hit the tigress but later
suspended three forest officials in connection with the case.

The
park has remained closed to visitors since July 1 and is due to reopen
on October 15. The only people who have access to the park right now
are forest officials. There have also been rumours about one or more
cubs missing from the park.

PTI, Tue Aug 10 2010

Bhopal,
Aug 10 (PTI) Two months after the death of a tigress, one of its three
cubs was found dead two days ago in an enclosure in Madhya Pradesh''s
Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, officials said today. 

"Mangled
remains of around seven months old were found in the enclosure spread
over an area of 42 hectares," Reserve Deputy Director K S Alawa told
PTI over phone. He said the cub had been killed by a tiger in the
enclosure, adding that it was hard to identify its sex given that a few
body parts of the striped animal were found. 

A day after the
cub was found dead in the enclosure, forest officials got the area
fully fenced to ensure that such incidents don''t recur as the place
has two more cubs that are being reared, sources said. 

On May
19, a tigress succumbed to her injuries after being hit by a jeep in
Bandhavgarh Reserve. The tigress had three cubs. The remaining two cubs
are being raised in the enclosure in the Bandhavgarh Reserve spread
over an area of 694 sq km in Umaria district, officials said.
