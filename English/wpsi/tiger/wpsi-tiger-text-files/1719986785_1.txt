The Sunderbans tiger hits a ton

 

10 April 2023The
big cat count in the Sunderbans has hit a century, a report on tiger
census across the country that was released by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi on Sunday said.

The report, titled Status of Tigers 2022,
was released by the Prime Minister at a programme in Mysore to
commemorate 50 years of Project Tiger.

“There are at least 100
tigers in the Sunderbans. The actual number would be more because the
estimate does not include cubs as they have a high mortality rate,”
said a state forest department official. In the Sunderbans, the tiger
count hovered around the 96 mark in two successive state-level
censuses, in 2019-20 and 2020-21.

The report says 100 different
tigers were photographed across the Sunderbans — in the Sunderbans
Tiger Reserve and the South 24-Parganas range. The country-wide
estimate of big cats is conducted every four years.
