All three tiger reserves of Chhattisgarh now in Maoist territory

 

17 Aug 2021

The
threat of Maoist conflict is now looming in Chhattisgarh’s Achanakmar
Tiger Reserve. The central government recently included Mungeli
district, where the tiger reserve is located, in the list of
Maoist-affected districts of the state.

The classification of
districts affected by Maoist insurgency is done to deploy resources and
plan interventions. Mungeli has been included in the list of districts
that are covered under the  Security Related Expenditure (SRE)
scheme as well as under a new category, ‘Districts of Concern’, created
to counter the spread of Maoist ideology and insurgency to new areas
and stop resurgence in some areas where it is controlled.
