3 tigers fleeing floods in Kaziranga National Park take shelter in fringe villages, rescue teams give safe passage

Everyone
in our family has seen a tiger, but today my mother could touch one,
she patted on its back,” said Kamal Sharma who hosted a Royal Bengal
tiger at his house in Kandhulimari village of Assam’s Golaghat district
on Monday.

A sub-adult tiger swam into the peripheral village,
just 200 metres from the flooded Agaratoli range of Kaziranga National
Park, and took shelter under the thatched goat-shed inside Sharma’s
house. It stayed all night in close proximity with the goats before
returning to the highlands next day at dusk - causing no harm to
livestock or humans.

“We heard noises at around 1:30am, but I
did not bother to look. Next morning, we saw fresh pug marks on ground,
and believed it was a tiger that might have rested for a while and
gone. My mother went inside the goat-shed to feed them hay and clean it
when she saw a sack like object lying below in water. She touched it
and without uttering a word hurried back to the house. She was
shivering for nearly 15 minutes and told us it was a tiger,” said
Sharma, a dairy farmer in the area.
