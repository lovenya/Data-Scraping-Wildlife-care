Tigers confirmed as six subspecies, and that is a big deal for conservation

 

26th October 2018



During my time as a zookeeper I had the privilege of working with
both Sumatran and Amur tigers. If they did not both have stripes, you
would think they were different species altogether.

The Sumatran
tiger is the smallest alive today. At around 100kg, it’s “only” about
the weight of a large adult male human. It is suited to the warm and
wet forests of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is reflected in
its smaller size and short, dark rusty orange coat which has many thin
black stripes to conceal it in dense vegetation from their prey.

The
Amur – or Siberian – tiger is much larger, averaging around 170kg
(though there are historic reports of males clocking in at 300kg or
more) and is now found mainly one corner of far-eastern Russia. It has
a thicker but relatively pale coat, with sparse dark brown stripes,
which enables it to survive in freezing and snowy winters.
