Explained: India’s newest Tiger Reserve, No 4 in Chhattisgarh

 

13 Oct 2021

On Tuesday
(October 5), the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) approved
the Chhattisgarh government’s proposal to declare the combined areas of
the Guru Ghasidas National Park and Tamor Pingla Wildlife Sanctuary as
a Tiger Reserve.

The new Reserve is located in the northern part
of the state, bordering Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. This will be the
fourth Tiger Reserve in Chhattisgarh, after the Udanti-Sitanadi,
Achanakmar, and Indravati Reserves.

The proposal was considered
by the 11th Technical Committee of the NTCA on September 1, and
approval was granted a month later under Section 38V(1) of The Wildlife
(Protection) Act, 1972. (“Tiger Conservation Plan: The State Government
shall, on the recommendation of the Tiger Conservation Authority,
notify an area as a tiger reserve.”)
