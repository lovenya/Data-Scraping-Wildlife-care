IUCN Nepal has celebrated this June 5th event, over the years, with its members and partners. This year was no different, as IUCN Nepal celebrated World Environment Day jointly with the Central Zoo - National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City, WWF Nepal and Bird Conservation Nepal (BCN). NTNC and BCN are also Institutional Members of IUCN.

A green walk was oranised in the streets Lalitpur, Nepal, drawing around 3,000 participants and a decorated elephant. Enthusiastic participants included school children from over 50 schools, government and non-government organizations representatives, and local community members. The walk was organized as a way to spread awareness on illegal wildlife trade issues. 

The rally ended with a formal programme, in which school children who had taken part in various competitions in the week leading up to the World Environment Day were awarded prizes. Miss Nepal, 2016, Asmee Shrestha, also administered a conservation oath. 

The chief guest at the event, Mr. Agni Sapkota, Honorable Minister of Forest and Soil Conservation, said the government was committed to developing eco-friendly measures in natural resource management and fighting against illegal wildlife trade. “The government has prioritised nature conservation and balance it alongside development. To do this, we have revised policies and our activities should also be nature-sensitive,” he said. Stressing the need for individual willpower for the conservation of natural resources, he also added that the Government will always support these initiatives.

During the event, the chief guest also released the Conservation Education Book published by IUCN Nepal.
