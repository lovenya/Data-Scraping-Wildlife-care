			Ali Kaka joined the conservation World in 1977 after returning home from studies at the University of Colorado, USA. He immediately joined the Wildlife Conservation and Management Department (WCMD) of the Kenya Government – which in later years transformed into Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) starting from a humble position of field Ranger and left in the position of acting Deputy Director. He served under no less than 5 different Directors! During his 23 years tenure with WCMD/KWS, he worked in almost all possible functions ranging from anti-poaching/ intelligence to wildlife and park management (both terrestrial and marine) and tourism. He was recruited by the East African Wildlife Society (EAWLS) in 2000 as their Executive Director. During his nine years tenure, the Society recovered financially and regained its role as the leading voice for conservation in Kenya and to some extent the wider East African region. Membership and the flagship publications of SWARA and African Journal of Ecology were revived with greater readership and membership in the region and abroad. In 2009, Ali was recruited by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the global leader in environmental conservation with its Headquarters in Switzerland. He was appointed as Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa based in Kenya. In his 5 years at the helm, new conservation programmes were initiated with improved participation by IUCN member as well as non-member governments. Ali decided to retire in 2014 from mainstream conservation to dedicate more time for volunteer and mentorship work. In 2016, at the World Conservation Congress of IUCN, he was elected by members of IUCN to the post of Regional Councilor from Africa as a member of the governing Council of IUCN. Ali continues his active involvement in conservation serving on a number of Trusts, Boards and Foundation in Kenya and abroad, including the Tusk Trust incorporating the Prince William Awards for Conservation in Africa. He has been awarded, among others, Kenya’s Order of Grand Warrior (OGW) and the National Geographic Society’s Howard Buffet Award for Leadership in Conservation in Africa. Ali also serves in national Task Forces on appointments by relevant governments in East and Southern Africa.
