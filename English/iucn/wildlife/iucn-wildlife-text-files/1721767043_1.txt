“THE POSEIDON PATROL - The Reef Riders” is the second in a two-part comic series targeted at children and focused on ocean conservation. This theme is aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 – Life Below Water - conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

“THE POSEIDON PATROL - The Reef Riders” is a story about the Poseidon Patrol which teams up with Reef Riders to protect coral reefs from plastic pollution. Coral reefs are important marine ecosystems. They are home to millions of species, including fish, corals, lobsters, clams, seahorses, sponges, and sea turtles, and offer food and safe places for these species to hide. They also protect coastal areas from flooding and dangerous storms.

Coral reefs are also very fragile and vulnerable to human-induced climate change, overfishing, pollution, ghost, and now plastic pollution.

Comics are an excellent way of capturing the attention of children and teaching them about environmental issues. The goal of this particular series is to get as many children as possible to be aware of and interested in ocean conservation and the threats facing them. This series also aims to teach children that the things we do on a daily basis, such as using single-use plastics, can have devastating impacts on marine and other wildlife.

The “THE POSEIDON PATROL - The Reef Riders” comic book has been released in English and French. Over the next few months, it will be released in Kanak, French Antilles Creole and Tahitian.
