At the heart of the TREPA and COMBIO projects' presence was a commitment to engage visitors in understanding the overarching missions and objectives of these initiatives while raising awareness about their crucial roles in restoring lands and biodiversity. The occasion provided a valuable opportunity for dialogue with beneficiaries, enabling the gathering of invaluable feedback to further enhance project outcomes.

Drawing significant interest from a broad spectrum of attendees, including government officials, security agencies, and students, the exhibition stands of the TREPA and COMBIO projects served as focal points for learning about TREPA and COMBIO projects’ dedication to nature conservation and their tangible impacts on communities across the Eastern Province.

COMBIO project is result of the partnership agreement between the Ministry of Environment and the Swedish Government, aimed at bolstering community resilience to climate change through the COMBIO Project. This collaborative effort, spanning seven districts in the Eastern Province, underscores a collective commitment to biodiversity restoration and climate adaptation.

The COMBIO project's involved approach, supported by key stakeholders such as the Rwanda Forestry Authority, IUCN and Enabel, focuses on mitigating climate change vulnerabilities through community-led restoration initiatives. By restoring degraded ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity, the project not only safeguards natural resources but also strengthens local livelihoods and ecosystem services.

Meanwhile, the TREPA project led by a consortium team of IUCN, Enabel, RFA, CIFOR- ICRAF, Cordaid, and World Visio continues its stride towards transforming 60,000 hectares of degraded landscapes into resilient ecosystems, employing strategies such as reforestation, agroforestry, and soil erosion control measures. With a targeted reach of 75,000 smallholder farmers, TREPA aims to bolster food security and foster financial inclusion for rural households, thereby building climate resilience from the ground up.

In a show of appreciation, the leadership of Rwamagana District, led by the Mayor of Rwamagana, Mr. Radjab Mbonyumuvunyi lauded the transformative impact of both the TREPA and COMBIO projects, recognizing their pivotal role in safeguarding natural resources and fostering resilient communities in the Eastern Province.

As these initiatives continue to gain momentum, they exemplify a collaborative vision for sustainable development, biodiversity conservation and where community well-being intertwines to forge a path towards a more resilient and prosperous future for Rwanda's Eastern Province.

Mukeshimana Angelique, one of the beneficiaries of the COMBIO project from Gahini Sector, Kayonza District, expressed her thoughts on the initiative. "As a farmer now part of this agroforestry project," she said, "I see it as more than just planting trees; it's sowing the seeds of a sustainable future.

Each tree we plant is a promise of nourishment for our land, our families, and generations to come."

She emphasized the importance of planting native species of trees around roadsides and on farms, underlining their role in biodiversity preservation and erosion control.

Mr. Radjab Mbonyumuvunyi, the Mayor of Rwamagana District, echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the significance of native tree species along roadsides.

He further elaborated on the importance of these trees, stating, "As our farmers deeply rooted in the lands, we know firsthand the significance of planting native tree species along roadsides and throughout their farms.

These trees not only enhance the beauty of our district surroundings but also serve as guardians of biodiversity, protectors against erosion, and providers of vital habitat for local wildlife. They're the steadfast guardians of agricultural heritage, ensuring a resilient and sustainable ecosystem for generations ahead."

Mr. Mbonyumuvunyi also discussed initiatives like TREPA, highlighting the expected benefits of rehabilitated forests in terms of timber production and carbon emissions reduction.

He emphasized the importance of proper forest management practices, such as using tree species adapted to local conditions, establishing water retention ditches, and providing training on silvicultural techniques.

Additionally, he mentioned that these projects would link farmers to investors for better returns and management.
