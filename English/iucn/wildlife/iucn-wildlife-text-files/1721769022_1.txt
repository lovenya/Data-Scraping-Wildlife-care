Mr. Danish Rashdi, Head IUCN Karachi Programme Office delivering the keynote speech noted that Mangroves and migratory birds play a crucial role in Pakistan's coastal ecosystems. Mangroves act as a natural barrier against coastal erosion and provide essential breeding and feeding grounds for various marine species, contributing to the livelihoods of coastal communities. They also sequester carbon and mitigate the impacts of climate change. 


Mr. Naveed Ali Soomro, Manager Sindh Programme, IUCN Pakistan highlighted the role of migratory birds and mentioned that they use the mangrove habitats as rest stops during their long journeys, aiding in global biodiversity conservation. Their presence reflects the health of these ecosystems, and their activities contribute to the local economy through ecotourism. Protecting and preserving both mangroves and migratory birds in Pakistan is not just a matter of environmental conservation but also a means of sustaining coastal communities and mitigating climate change effects.

Dr. Babar Hussain, Natural Resource Management Coordinator, IUCN Pakistan  commended the Kakkapeer communities for their dedicated role as custodians of the mangroves. He acknowledged the community's efforts in promoting ecotourism through activities like bird watching.


Guests of honour Mr. Farhan Hassany, CEO Haroon Oils, and Mr. Abdul Basit, Director Deewan Group, praised the community's interventions pertaining to mangrove conservation.

The event concluded with a symbolic mangrove plantation activity involving participants and local communities at the Sandspit backwaters. This event highlighted the shared responsibility of local communities and dedicated conservation organizations, such as IUCN Pakistan, in protecting and preserving these vital habitats. It emphasized the importance of conserving these habitats and reaffirmed the collective commitment to protecting the rich biodiversity in Sandspit, Karachi.

The Azad Pattan observance event saw the active participation of the AJ&K Wildlife Department, local communities, academia, and the IUCN project team. Dr. ZB Mirza, a renowned wildlife expert, delivered an informative lecture, shedding light on the significance of migratory avifauna in Pakistan.
