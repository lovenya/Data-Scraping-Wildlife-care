"Concerns about the state of the world’s oceans are widespread. At the same time, interest in the economic potential of the oceans is escalating, with their contribution to the global economy projected to double from US$1.5 trillion in 2010 to US$3 trillion by 2030.

Numerous governments and corporations herald ocean sectors as lucrative frontiers for investment, including fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, bio-prospecting, seabed mining, oil and gas, renewable energy, and shipping. The blue economy — a term that originally implied socially equitable and sustainable development but has come to encapsulate international interest in the growth of ocean-based economic development — has been a central theme of recent global ocean policy conferences.

Many coastal countries and small-island developing states (SIDS) also see promise in ocean-based growth6,7. Indeed, SIDS were among the first to advocate for attention to the blue economy, which, in their vision, features social equity and environmental sustainability as core tenets7,8 (Fig. 1). We are concerned that the push for economic growth through ocean development is sidelining these tenets in policy and practice. Unbridled ocean development risks producing substantial harms for both the marine environment and human wellbeing." (Bennett et al., 2019).
