November 6, 2014, SOS reported on a revised population count for Critically Endangered Javan Rhinos in Ujung Kulon National Park. The survey which began in 2013 used extensive camera trapping to assess the population. It also relied heavily on the knowledge and energies of the Rhino Protection Units that patrol the park virtually non-stop.
Encouragingly the total tally was closer to 60 individuals as opposed to the official estimate of 35-44 animals.
Reading about such news is one thing, but seeing some of the world's rarest mammals is another - helping connect us with the precious nature and wildlife we are trying to protect.
And perhaps it is fitting that connection was enabled by new technologies such as remote camera traps and GPS.Â 
Few have seen a Javan Rhino in the flesh - they are elusive and very rare after all, but seeing a real live one move across the screen of our desktops or mobile devices can remind us that nature is infinitely more complex and precious than the tools with which we work to protect it.
