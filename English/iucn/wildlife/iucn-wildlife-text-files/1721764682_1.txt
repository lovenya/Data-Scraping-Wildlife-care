But we have little quantitative information on wild biodiversity conservation in category V. A new volume from IUCN and GIZ, produced by the WCPA Protected Landscapes Specialist Group, provides the first global survey of wild biodiversity conservation in protected landscapes and seascapes, with detailed case studies from Croatia, Spain, Germany, Mozambique, Colombia, Mexico, India and Canada.
The research shows that category V protected areas can – if managed sensitively and effectively – be effective vehicles for biodiversity conservation. It also shows that communities living in and around such areas are often deeply committed to the maintenance of natural values. The book includes a more general global assessment and a detailed list of recommendations.
