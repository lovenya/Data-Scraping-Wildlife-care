His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej has led the nation for 70 years and is a central figure in modern Asian history. Under his reign, the country’s strides in economic and social development have been enormous, many of which are unprecedented.

His Majesty is widely recognised for his visionary leadership and compassion. He played an instrumental role in the conservation of Thailand’s vast natural resources - soil, water, wildlife and forest ecosystems. During his reign, the Kingdom of Thailand (then, Siam) was one of the signatories of the constitution that established IUCN in 1948.  His insightful and forward thinking about the Sufficiency Economy and his philosophy on nature-based solutions has steered the country towards a future that is based on sustainability, equity and a better life for all Thai people. 

IUCN draws immense inspiration from His Majesty’s lifelong and selfless dedication and efforts to promote nature conservation and sustainable development.  We join the people of Thailand during this period of national mourning and reflection.
