IUCN participated in this meeting in its capacity as longstanding observer to the initiative, as ECOLEX partner and as project consultant. Having developed the Thesaurus on Environmental Law and Conventions (more than 500 concepts also referred to as LEO - Law and Environment Ontology) at the IUCN Environmental Law Centre, the second phase of this consultancy included


	assisting selected MEAs in using the thesaurus
	mapping ECOLEX keywords to the thesaurus to make ECOLEX resources retrievable in the InforMEA portal
	testing automated tagging tools


The results were presented during the meeting and discussed in respective working groups.

The project is ongoing and aims at analysis of national reports in the context of the thesaurus as well as further mapping efforts between thesaurus and SDGs.

 

New features in the InforMEA portal include a Goals section, presenting the collective contribution by MEAs towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and additional e-learning tools.

The MEA-IKM initiative is supported by the European Union (EU) and co-chaired by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
