Environmental degradation and climate change are two of the biggest challenges facing the world today. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which consists of hundreds of scientists from around the world, has stated that human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of climate change. Other international organizations, such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), have also identified environmental degradation and climate change as major challenges that require urgent action to protect the planet and its inhabitants.

The urgency of these issues requires that all voices are heard and accounted for in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, women, who are often on the front lines of environmental degradation, are still largely underrepresented in environmental policy and action on the ground. An example of women being on the front lines of environmental degradation but underrepresented in environmental policy and action is the case of Berta CÃ¡ceres, an indigenous Lenca woman and environmental activist in Honduras. She led the fight against the construction of the Agua Zarca Dam, which would have displaced the Lenca people and destroyed the Gualcarque River, a sacred site for the community. Despite receiving death threats, she continued to fight for environmental justice. In 2016, she was assassinated in her home. Her murder is a tragic example of the violence and discrimination faced by women environmental defenders, who are often marginalized and excluded from decision-making processes, even though their communities are directly affected by environmental degradation. Her case also highlights the urgent need to empower and amplify the voices of women in environmental policy and action.

The role of women in environmental management and conservation has long been recognized by many scholars and practitioners. Women often have deep knowledge of their local ecosystems, and are habitually the primary caregivers and providers for their families. They are more likely to be directly impacted by environmental degradation, particularly in developing countries where they may rely heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods. Yet, women are still excluded from decision-making processes, especially at the national and international levels where environmental policies are made. According to data from the Global Gender Gap Report 2021 by the World Economic Forum, women remain underrepresented in political leadership positions around the world. The report found that only 25.5% of parliamentary seats globally are held by women, as well as only 22.5% of ministerial positions. These disparities are particularly acute in the environmental sector, where women are often excluded from decision-making processes and leadership positions, despite being disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and climate change. For example, a study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found that women account for only 12% of negotiators in climate change decision-making processes and only 27% of national delegations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conferences. These statistics demonstrate that women are still excluded from decision-making processes at the national and international levels where environmental policies are made, and highlight the urgent need to address gender inequality in environmental policy and action.

One of the reasons for this exclusion is the historical and ongoing gender inequalities that exist in many societies. Women are often relegated to subordinate roles, and their voices and perspectives are often dismissed or overlooked. As a result, policies and programs that are developed and implemented without considering women's needs and interests can fail to achieve their intended goals, and even worsen existing inequalities.

Women's participation in environmental policy and action is not only a matter of equity and justice, but also essential for achieving sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment in achieving its 17 sustainable development goals. It states that "gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world."

In the context of environmental policy and action, empowering women means ensuring their meaningful participation in decision-making processes and providing them with the necessary resources and opportunities to take action. This includes recognizing their knowledge and expertise, and supporting their leadership and entrepreneurship. Women-led initiatives have been shown to be effective in promoting sustainable resource management, improving livelihoods, and reducing poverty. For example, in many parts of Africa, women have been leading efforts to restore degraded land through the planting of trees and other vegetation. This has not only improved the environment, but also provided them with additional sources of income.

Another area where women's participation is crucial is in climate change adaptation and mitigation. Climate change impacts women and men differently, and women are often more vulnerable due to their lower socio-economic status, gender roles, and limited access to resources. However, women are also important agents of change in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable lifestyles. For instance, women are often responsible for household energy use, and promoting energy-efficient technologies and practices can help reduce emissions and improve their health and well-being.

In conclusion, empowering women and amplifying their voices in environmental policy and action is crucial to achieve sustainable development and address the urgent environmental challenges facing the world today. It requires recognizing the gender inequalities that exist, and working to overcome them through inclusive and gender-responsive policies and programs. It also requires valuing women's knowledge and expertise, and supporting their leadership and entrepreneurship. Only by doing so can we ensure that the environmental policies and actions we take are effective, equitable, and sustainable for all.
