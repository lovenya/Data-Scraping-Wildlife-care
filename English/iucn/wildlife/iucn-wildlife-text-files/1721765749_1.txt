In March 2016, IUCN carried out a monitoring mission to Chitwan National Park to assess its state of conservation, following a request by the World Heritage Committee.

Nestled at the foot of the Himalayas, the park was listed as a natural World Heritage site in 1984 for its rich fauna and flora. For the past 15 years, it has been facing a number of threats, and most recently from proposed road and railroad developments.

The mission report, now available online, makes a set of 13 recommendations to the government of Nepal, including: improving access to education and health facilities for isolated communities; carrying out environmental impact assessments for a proposed road outside the park and a suspension bridge; committing to not approve further proposed road developments, current or future, that would bisect the park; and seeking solutions to encroachment of important wildlife habitats in the park’s buffer zone, in an effort to secure wildlife corridors and reduce human-wildlife conflict.

IUCN is the official advisory body on natural World Heritage. The World Heritage Committee gathers annually to discuss the state of conservation of sites affected by threats and make decisions, following IUCN’s recommendations.

The recent mission to Chitwan National Park will serve as a valuable source of information for discussion in 2017 for the 41st World Heritage Committee, due to take place in Kraków, Poland in July.
