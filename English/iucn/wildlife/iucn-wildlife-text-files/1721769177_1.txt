The call is open for all Vietnamese citizens from 21 – 45 years old and interested in environmental protection and wildlife conservation especially sea turtles. In 2024, given the high demand of the programme, IUCN have discussed with Con Dao NP to increase the number of volunteer trips to seven trips (compared with six trips in 2023) and the number of volunteers each trip is 22 instead of 16 volunteers as 2023.

The dates for each trip are listed below:

Trip 1: 13/6 – 24/6/2024
Trip 2: 23/6 – 04/7/2024
Trip 3: 03/7 – 12/7/2024
Trip 4: 11/7 – 22/7/2024
Trip 5: 21/7 – 01/8/2024
Trip 6: 31/7 – 11/8/2024
