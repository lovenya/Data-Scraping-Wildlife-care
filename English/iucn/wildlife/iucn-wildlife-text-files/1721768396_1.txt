The May webinar will be presented by Professor Colin Reid, University of Dundee, on 18 May 2022 at 5pm (AEST, Sydney time). The session will be chaired by Associate Professor Peter Davies. The title of Professor Colin Reid’s webinar is “Towards a Biodiversity Law – The Changing Nature of Wildlife Law.” The talk considers features of the development of wildlife law. It has evolved from simply restraining the most directly harmful conduct directed against a few favoured sites and species towards a more holistic approach. This has required the law to become more pervasive, applying in ever more situations, and more positive, as shown by the change in terminology from protection to conservation.
