Extremely diverse, Myanmar is home to 10% of the world's freshwater turtles and tortoises on just over 1% of the world's land area, at least 250 mammal species and more than 1,000 bird species. The country has also acquired a reputation for sustainable forest management, establishing protected areas and protecting wildlife.

“IUCN is extremely honoured to have the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, represented by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, join IUCN as a State Member,” says Aban Marker Kabraji, IUCN Regional Director, Asia. “As an IUCN Member, the Government can look forward to increased access to technical assistance, project partnership, and global networking and influence”.

In 2014, Myanmar joined Mangroves for the Future (MFF) as the 11th member country. MFF's work in Myanmar is overseen by the National Coordinating Body (NCB), which is chaired by the Director General of the Forest Department. 

In the same year, IUCN, in partnership with Fauna and Flora International, conducted research on the coral reefs of the Myeik Archipelago. The results formed the basis of a Marine Protected Area plan for the archipelago. 

In 2015, IUCN assisted the then Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (MOECAF) to prepare a revised National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) for 2015-20. Together with HELVETAS and local NGOs NAG and BANCA, IUCN is also a partner in the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation’s Community-Led Coastal Management in the Gulf of Mottama Project.

In 2016, a Host Country Agreement (HCA) to establish an IUCN Country Office in Nay Pyi Taw was signed by IUCN and the Forest Department. IUCN also has a project office in Mawlamyine.

IUCN looks forward to continuing to support Myanmar in its efforts toward biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.
