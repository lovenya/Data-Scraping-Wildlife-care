It was against this background that the Kingdom of Bahrain in partnership with UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre and IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas hosted a workshop from 24 to 26 February 2009. The focus was to build on previous analyses of inadequacies and imperatives of the Convention with regard to the marine environment and to develop a clear road map of actions. The road map, which when implemented, would significantly move the world community closer to more effective application of the Convention in the marine environment. The roadmap is called the Bahrain Plan of Action for marine World Heritage.
 
This report reviews recent progress on developing the marine World Heritage programme and within the global and regional context sets out the Bahrain Action Plan.
