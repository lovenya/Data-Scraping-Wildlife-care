Richard contributed greatly to IUCN and the work of our Members. He played a key role in efforts to combat elephant and rhino poaching, campaigned for protection of great apes, and led calls to tackle threats to biodiversity.

In an illustrious career spanning six decades, Richard was Director of Kenya’s National Museums, Director of the Wildlife Conservation and Management department, founding Director and Chairman of the Kenya Wildlife Service, Member of Parliament in Kenya, Head of the Public Service and Secretary to the Cabinet. He founded and led the Turkana Basin Institute, and was appointed Professor of Anthropology at Stony Brook University.

Since 2011 as an IUCN Patron of Nature and adviser to the Director General, Richard helped rally global leaders and mobilise resources in support of the Union’s vision of a just world which values and conserves nature.

We send our deepest condolences to Richard’s family and his many friends and colleagues; you can post personal tributes here.
