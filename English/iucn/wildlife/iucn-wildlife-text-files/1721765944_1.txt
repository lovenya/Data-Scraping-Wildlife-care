The reports mostly concern physicaly injured or poisoned birds. To a lesser extent the assistance is given to mammals, mostly bats spotted in the buildings or other niches where their survival is unsafe or to reptiles, mainly snakes found in and around houses. „Birds remain, however, by far the most important group of animals we rescue“, says Ilija Miljković, a member of the field team, together with Nikola Danilović and Nebojša Stojanović. They work practically throughout the week, transporting safely the reported animals most often to the Recovery Center for Wild Animals in Palić Zoo, where urgent veterinarian care is available. After the recovery, the animals are released back to nature. In December 2016 the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection donated a special vehicle (a donation of Delegation of European Union to Serbia) to the Institute, aiming to assure a more effective implementation of the CITES convention and national nature conservation legislation. This vehicle is, therefore, also used for the work of inspections and police in cases of other illegal activities involving wildlife crime, e.g. capturing, trade, and illegal killing of wild animals.
