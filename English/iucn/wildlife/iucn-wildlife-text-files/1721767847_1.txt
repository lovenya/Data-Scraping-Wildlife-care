The online series was funded through a USAID Kenya and East Africa programme called ‘Conserving Natural Capital and Enhancing Collaborative Management of Transboundary Resources (CONNECT)’ which specifically focusses on the East African region but the content is relevant to all working on this IWT.

The series was based on the application of the ‘Local Communities: First Line of Defence against Illegal Wildlife Trade’ (FLoD) approach, which aims to support designers and implementers of anti-IWT strategies and projects to effectively engage local communities as partners.

The FLoD approach takes advantage of an iterative learning process to help local communities, project designers and implementers at site and landscape levels to understand the context-specific motivations and assumptions that underpin the activities (legal and illegal) of local communities.

As Holly Dublin, SULi steering committee member highlighted “We have found that many times anti-IWT interventions weren’t based on local realities. The FLoD tool helps to empower those communities, strengthen their voice and enhance collaboration while building trust. Ultimately it helps in the design of more effective interventions to combat IWT with the help of communities.”

Recordings and presentations from the training sessions are available at https://www.peoplenotpoaching.org/training/communities-combating-illegal-wildlife-trade-online-learning-series-east-african-community and will supplement a comprehensive training course on FLoD, which is currently under development with support from the BIOPAMA programme supported by the European Union and the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States. And you can read a Q&A with some of the participants here: https://www.iied.org/qa-communities-combating-illegal-wildlife-trade-east-africa

The IIED/SULi web portal - https://www.peoplenotpoaching.org/ - includes a database of over 100 case studies from around the world and in a fantastic resource for anyone interested in exploring practical examples of community engagement. We are always looking for more examples, so if you have case studies you would like to add please get in touch!

Her work focuses on the human dimensions of conservation – including understanding and supporting the necessary conditions for effective communitybased conservation. A strong element of her current work is on engaging local communities in tackling illegal wildlife trade and, more broadly, enhancing community voices in conservation policymaking and strategies for linking biodiversity conservation with human wellbeing and social justice.
