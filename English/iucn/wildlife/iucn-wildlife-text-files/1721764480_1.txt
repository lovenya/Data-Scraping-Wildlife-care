The latest issue of World Conservation magazine takes stock of the Convention on Biological Diversity conference that took place in Japan last October where governments approved a ‘Big Plan’ for saving biodiversity and looks ahead to what’s in store for conservation in the coming years. We cover some of the latest thinking and new approaches that might be used and hear prominent figures outline what they see as the greatest priority for saving biodiversity. Which new partners will become engaged in conservation? What progress will be made in curbing burgeoning levels of wildlife trade? What future for the oceans?
