Our mission was funded by the European Union's generous contribution to the BIOPAMA project, which focuses on capacity building and creating synergies for Melanesian countries. Our team comprised experts in Marine, Protected and Conserved Areas, and Nature-Based Solutions. This is my third trip to this remarkable part of the world promised new adventures and insights into conservation efforts and the rich natural heritage of the region.

 

A Sunny Day with Looming Concerns

The day dawned with a radiant sun, blessing Port Moresby with its warm embrace. After months of unpredictable weather, this was a welcome change. As we gathered for breakfast, our spirits were high, fueled by a healthy spread of fresh fruits, cereals, and local coffee. The breakfast table not only nourished our bodies but also our excitement for the day ahead. However, the news of tropical cyclones preparing to strike some countries in the region served as a stark reminder of the fragility of these paradisiacal places and the urgency of our mission.

Meeting the Guardians of Conservation

Our first stop was to meet senior government officials at the Conservation and Environment Protection Agency (CEPA) of Papua New Guinea. CEPA plays a pivotal role in overseeing environmental and climate change matters in the country. The importance of this agency cannot be overstated, as it serves as a guardian of the nation's invaluable natural resources. We discussed ongoing initiatives, shared ideas, and planned future collaborations. The dedication of the CEPA team to preserving the environment was truly inspiring.

Recognising the work of BIOPAMA Grantee 

With the morning meetings concluded, we embarked on a field trip to a nearby site where one of the BIOPAMA grantees had been actively involved in conservation efforts. This was a perfect opportunity to see first-hand the impact of the BIOPAMA project. We were greeted by dedicated locals who had been working tirelessly to protect their natural heritage.

One of the highlights of our visit was the Nature Park in Port Moresby. This park is a sanctuary for various species, both native and exotic. What sets it apart is its extensive network of partnerships with local and international organizations. The park is a shining example of how collaboration can enhance conservation efforts.

Port Moresby Nature Park: A Biodiversity Oasis

Port Moresby Nature Park, our next destination, was a revelation in itself. This remarkable park is home to over 2,500 individual animals, representing more than 450 different species. It is an oasis of biodiversity, where visitors can witness a wide range of wildlife up close, from vibrant parrots to graceful tree kangaroos and elusive reptiles. The park's dedication to preserving Papua New Guinea's unique biodiversity has earned it numerous awards and recognitions, making it a shining example of conservation efforts in the region.

Port Moresby Nature Park has been recognized for its outstanding contribution to wildlife conservation. Awards and recognitions include the Paga Hill Estate Conservation Award and the prestigious Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Gold Award for Environment.

This incredible park is not only a testament to the dedication of its staff but also to the support it receives. It relies on funding from various sources, including the European Union's BIOPAMA project. Additionally, it collaborates with a wide range of partners, including local and international conservation organizations, universities, and research institutions. These partnerships enable the park to conduct vital research and education programs that contribute to the long-term preservation of Papua New Guinea's unique biodiversity.

Supporting BIOPAMA Grantees: Tree Kangaroos and Tenkile

The BIOPAMA project supports a variety of grantees, some of which we had the privilege to meet during our visit. Tree Kangaroos and Tenkile are two such grantees that have made significant contributions to conservation in Papua New Guinea. The Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program works diligently to protect the endangered tree kangaroos, which are emblematic of the region's unique wildlife. The Tenkile Conservation Alliance, on the other hand, focuses on safeguarding the critically endangered Tenkile tree kangaroo. These organizations are living proof that with determination, expertise, and support, we can make a difference in the conservation of these incredible species.

Our journey to Port Moresby was not only about experiencing the breathtaking natural beauty of Papua New Guinea but also about connecting with the passionate individuals and organizations working tirelessly to protect it. The sunny day and vibrant biodiversity of Port Moresby provided a stark contrast to the looming cyclones in the region. It reminded us that the work we do, supported by projects like BIOPAMA and the European Union, is essential to preserving the precious natural heritage of Melanesian countries.

Upcoming Adventure: Varirata National Park

As our day in Port Moresby drew to a close, the team ventured into Varirata National Park, an untouched wilderness teeming with life. Our goal was to explore this natural wonder and gain valuable insights into the conservation efforts underway in this pristine environment.

The sun may have set on our day at Port Moresby Nature Park, but our commitment to preserving the extraordinary biodiversity of Papua New Guinea remains as bright as ever. Join us in our journey of exploration and conservation as we continue to uncover the natural wonders of this beautiful country.
