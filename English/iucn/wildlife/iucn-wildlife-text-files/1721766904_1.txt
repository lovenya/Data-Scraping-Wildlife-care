The event built on two Red List training and assessment workshops in Yezin in 2017 and 2018, which resulted in the national Red List assessments of 70 reptile species.

With the support of the Forest Department’s Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division, WCS, and WWF, IUCN led a 1-day refresher training on applying the Red List Categories and Criteria for members of the Myanmar National Red List Mammals Working Group (MWG) that includes representatives of several universities and international and local NGOs such as WCS, WWF, FFI, and BANCA).

Following the refresher training, MWG members spent three days working with the two IUCN trainers to assess 43 mammal species.  This included 11 species of primates, 10 species of carnivores, 10 species of bats, and four species of rodents. These draft assessments will undergo a review process prior to publishing.
