In this context, comprehensive, integrated regulatory response to the ever-growing challenge of waste plastics in the environment requires a complex mix of legal measures applied in a coherent manner at the global, regional and domestic levels of administration to a range of environmental media and related activities, including sustainable production and consumption, circular economy, waste management, freshwater resources management, biodiversity protection, and marine pollution. Measures to address the problem of plastic pollution are to be found across several sub-fields of international law, biodiversity law, natural resources law, international wildlife law, fisheries and oceans laws, and international freshwater law. Therefore, a clear need for effective mechanisms of interaction between any new plastics treaty and other pertinent international regimes exists. This reflects recent efforts of Conferences of the Parties for various multilateral environmental agreements to create synergies and mechanisms of coordination between treaty regimes with overlapping terms and areas of regulation. This is Briefing 5 of 6 for INC-2.
