This study demonstrated  scenarios for such governance from three agro-ecological zones in  different geographical, biophysical and socio-cultural settings: (i)  Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary in the temperate forests of the Central  Himalayas, (ii) Kolleru Lake, a freshwater lake in the Krishna Basin and  (iii) the downstream Ganges seasonal floodplains in Bangladesh. The  cross-disciplinary set of approaches in these examples involves the use  of spatial tools and socioeconomic surveys to build a scenario-based  framework with cross-scaling prospects. 
The comparative analysis between  these sites is significant in the context of providing guidance for  trans-boundary environmental governance and the underlying challenges  that occur in politically complex and common property resource  institutional arrangements. 
Meeting these challenges will assist in the  efforts, locally and nationally, to make wise use of all wetlands, as  required under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Kedarnath Wildlife  Sanctuary symbolizes a case of increasing anthropogenic pressure,  limited livelihood options and with gaps in the governance structure.  Kolleru Lake represents a case of inadequate understanding of the  ecological dimensions of livelihood interventions and the consequential  community conflict. The case of floodplains in Bangladesh illustrates  the potential of collective action, supported by appropriate  institutional arrangements, for improving rice-fish productivity. The  case studies support the argument that monitoring and assessment of the  resource structure and its dynamics, with the application of geospatial  tools, adds value when shaping a framework for policy debate and for  ensuring the wise use of wetlands.
