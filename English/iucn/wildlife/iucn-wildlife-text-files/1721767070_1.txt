Chapter 6 in IPBES' regional assessment report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services For the Americas emphasizes that in most countries of the region, the environment is mostly dealt with as a separate sector in national planning, and has hitherto not been effectively mainstreamed across development sectors. Indeed, despite reported reductions in the rate of loss in specific biomes in the Americas, the net loss that is currently evident in almost every aspect of the region’s natural ecosystems is expected to continue through to 2050, driven largely by unsustainable agricultural practices and climate change. However, ecological restoration is having positive effects at local scales, speeding up ecosystem recovery in many cases. In this regard, there is an overall lack of policy evaluation in the Americas, which is more pronounced in Latin America and the Caribbean than it is in North America.

To read more about the cross roads between the lack of policy evaluation, biodiversity net-loss, local environmental restoration, and the development sector in the Americas, read the rest of Chapter 6 here.
