The event was presided by the Honorable Minister of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) Mr. Varawut Silpa-archa, Permanent Secretary of MONRE, Mr. Jatuporn Burutpat, Director General of DNP, Mr. Rutchada Suriyakul Na Ayuttaya, and Director General of DMCR, Mr. Sopon Thongdee. More than 650 rangers attended the event from the Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant conservation (DNP), Royal Forest Department (RFD) and Department of Marine and Coastal Resource (DMCR).

Mr. Pasha emphasized the importance of protecting and conserving Thailand’s natural resources as a country with high endemism and biological diversity, as well as the responsibility of rangers in protecting this. 

He further stated, “today, species are going extinct 1,000 times faster than at any point in Earth's history, and even within protected areas. Despite the high proportions of threatened species, rangers are working hard to reverse, or at least halt the decline in biodiversity. A ranger’s work is one of the most dynamic and diverse jobs, which includes patrolling forests, marine and coastal areas through SMART patrol, while also monitoring wildlife, combating poaching, and engaging with local communities to manage forest fires and facilitate tourism initiatives.”

On this very special day, IUCN would like to recognize and remember the many rangers who have lost their lives in the line of duty protecting Thailand’s forests, wildlife, coastal and marine protected areas. IUCN stands with the world’s rangers and salutes their valor, dedication and passion. Rangers are the true custodians of our planet.
