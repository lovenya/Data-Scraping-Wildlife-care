Over five days the trainees entered and reviewed data for each protected area. These data will be used as the basis of a State of the Parks report for Myanmar. Training was delivered by IUCN WCPA members Dr. Marc Hockings, Sue Stolton, and Nigel Dudley and held at the Forest Department training center near Yangon. The training was funded by the Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA) and organized in cooperation with the Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division (NWCD).
