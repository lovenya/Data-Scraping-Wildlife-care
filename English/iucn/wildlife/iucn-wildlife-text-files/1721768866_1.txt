In his meeting with the IUCN Thailand National Committee, discussions focused on engagement with stakeholders beyond the IUCN Membership – particularly the private sector. Members were reassured that as IUCN continues to establish new partnerships, there will be strict and rigorous processes in place, and that Members would be regularly kept updated.

At the beginning of his Thailand mission, the Director General also visited the Dong Phayayen Khaoyai Forest Complex (Tap Lan and Khao Yai National Parks), where he met with the national park’s superintendents, as well as the representatives of Freeland Foundation, an IUCN Member, to discuss issues such as human-wildlife conflict management and wildlife tourism. Learning about the success of implementing the SMART Patrol system within the forest complex, Dr Oberle stressed the importance of empowering park rangers and using technology in addressing conservation issues. 

On the same mission, Dr Oberle also met with Thailand’s Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, along with the Director General of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dr Oberle thanked the Thai Government for supporting IUCN in implementing national projects, and for strengthening IUCN’s presence in the country.
