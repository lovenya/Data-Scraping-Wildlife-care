The origin and mutation of the novel version of the corona virus (COVID-19) still seems murky. It seems though that it is product of natural evolution.[i][ii] 75% of all emerging infectious diseases come from wildlife. The relevant factors to this evolution include ecosystem and land use change; species endangerment or extinction; illegal and poorly regulated wildlife trade; and climate change[iii] aggravated by rampant environmental crime.  The COVID-19 pandemic, exists above and adds pressure to underlying vulnerabilities. Vulnerability factors such as persisting inequality, poverty and unemployment affecting wellbeing in the hemisphere, are expected to rise while GDP plunges as a result of the pandemic. These factors coupled with the climate crisis and air pollution, the largest environmental public health risk in the Americas linked to pandemic case increase and deaths, add pressure and amplify existing risks increasing susceptibility of communities in the region.

The hemisphere is at the intersection of environmental change, security, and rule of law facing non-traditional threats to security. A disaster, the casualty and spillover effect of the COVID-19 pandemic extends to and goes deep into the people and planet relationship. It is just another symptom of unchanged behavior that negatively affects human and nature systems. Nature continues to follow a dangerous decline path, furthering inequality and reflecting on the ongoing undermining and poor state of compliance with global sustainability, [iv][v]  disaster[vi]  and Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA)[vii]  goals.

The study of environmental law, in principle is the study of society at risk, of science’s overwhelming facts and understanding of the limits and current socio-environmental problems. Given these compelling circumstances it is time for environmental law to react in a society at risk generating new solutions to new and urgent social demands. There is no one recipe for the necessary post pandemic transformation in the Americas and beyond.

The Berlin Principles on “One Planet One Health” [viii] call for a vision capable of considering every aspect of the global crisis. The post pandemic model requires coherent, targeted and scaled up social protection policies and assistance packages[ix] that incorporate the unintended effects of the measures in place to contain the pandemic, reduced pollution and carbon emissions to prevent returning to the model that contributed to the pandemic causality.

Risk reduction, management, resilience, and rule of law are key concepts. The principles and elements of environmental law in a society at risk must be applied in tandem with disaster law as a common value set that maximizes the effectiveness of environmental protection. Judiciaries have an important role esspecially in the current scenario leading to lawsuits.

Resilience at all levels calls for deliberately reducing underlying risk factors within the appropriate frameworks from domestic EIA planning to the post 2020 Biodiversity framework,[x] National Determined Contributions (NDCs) and all MEAs. This means, a holistic commitment to nature conservation, encouraging sustainability and principled based compliance and enforcement with budget. It also means prioritizing climate justice based on the rule of law. Internalizing these values with the precautionary principle should be central.

We are before the ethical challenge of our time. One that will shape what the next time looks like. Success and effectiveness in the legal response to the pandemic and preparing for the next time must be a coherent, non-optional, decision from the national to the global level.  It is time of rethinking and paying attention to the human-ecology balance and to society’s common approach. It's time to take better care of nature. It is time to take care of each other.
