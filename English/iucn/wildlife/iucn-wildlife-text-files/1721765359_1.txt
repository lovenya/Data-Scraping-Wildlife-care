The intentional genetic manipulation of wildlife for profit or amenity reasons is becoming increasingly acute. For antelopes this mainly concerns production of unnatural colour morphs or enlarged horns, but it is a much wider problem, affecting many other taxa. IUCN SSC is in the process of developing overall guidelines in response. 

 ASG has received several requests to clarify our position on this issue, therefore we have developed a position statement (see download).
