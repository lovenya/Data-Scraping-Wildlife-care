The proposed 30% objective for effective area-based conservation will require a significant scaling of investment into governance, management and monitoring. Parties are rightly seeking solutions for the cost implications of expanded area-based conservation coverage.

This session will highlight case studies and proposals for increasing public and private investment into attainment and progress on Target 3. Co-hosts will share insights into innovative and transferable financial mechanisms that could support country- and system-scale investment. Presenters will show how the proposed GBF Target 3’s focus on effectiveness, and metrics for measuring impact and improvement, could help unlock potential investment streams and financial flows.

Case studies will demonstrate the potential of sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs – Chile, Fiji) and related outcome-based financing (such as wildlife recovery bonds, GEF/Kenya) and make comparisons with similar Sustainable Development Goal investment models could be adapted to the GBF and Target 3 through a focus on SDGs 14 and 15 (Uzbekistan). Additional country-led perspectives on how financing for performance will help achieve the proposed Target 3 will be shared (Peru and Colombia, Seychelles, and the Landscape Legacy Fund and KfW investments in several countries).
