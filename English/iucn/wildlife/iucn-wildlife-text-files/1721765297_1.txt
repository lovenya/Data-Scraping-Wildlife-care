Over the last centuries, vast forest areas worldwide have been cleared to meet the needs of a growing population. In fact, about 30% of global forest cover has been cleared and a further 20 % has

been degraded. This has led to significant reduction in biomass, biodiversity and ecosystem services from forests. FLR provides the opportunity for breaking the spiral of loss and degradation while

generating multiple benefits. For example, restored landscapes support livelihoods and biodiversity through provision of clean water, reducing soil erosion, providing wildlife habitat, biofuels and

other forest products. In addition, restoration of forest landscapes plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon. Restoration of trees in agricultural landscapes can boost food productivity through enhanced soil fertility and moisture conservation. It is important to note that forest landscape restoration activities must complement and not displace existing land uses to result in a mos aic of different land uses, including for example agriculture, agroforestry systems and improved fallow systems, ecological corridors, discrete areas of forests and woodlands, and river or lakeside plantings to protect waterways.
