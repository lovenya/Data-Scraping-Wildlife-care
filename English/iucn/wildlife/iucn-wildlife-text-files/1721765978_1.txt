The symposium was convened by members of the Species Working Group of the Pacific Islands Roundtable for Nature Conservation, highlighting species conservation priorities and promoting collaboration amongst Pacific Islanders working in species conservation.

This special journal edition provided a first time for some Pacific Island authors to publish their work.

Speaking at the launch, Helen Pippard of IUCN Oceania, one of the three editors of the issue, reiterated the key messages from the Symposium: that high quality, robust scientific research is being undertaken on a variety of species in the Pacific; that such data is important to improving our understanding of species and can feed into species management plans, protected area designation, national legislation and international Conventions; that increasing networking and collaborative opportunities can help to achieve conservation outcomes; and that the publication of results and findings is vital – collaborative efforts are only useful if messages reach government, decision makers, and community conservation managers.

IUCN Oceania is delighted to have been able to fund the printing of the hard copies of this edition.

Said Helen Pippard, “It has been a privilege to be involved in the production of this fantastic publication, and to provide support to the work of such a diverse group of Pacific Island scientists and conservationists”.

The special edition is dedicated to the legacy of Johnson Seeto, a long-standing staff member of USP, who was a colleague, friend and true mentor to the students of USP.

IUCN Oceania also acknowledges the input and support of fellow editors Dr Gilliane Brodie and Dr Cara Miller from USP, as well as the Wildlife Conservation Society for additional publication support; and last but by no means least, the 36 authors and co-authors from the Pacific without whom, this publication would not exist.
