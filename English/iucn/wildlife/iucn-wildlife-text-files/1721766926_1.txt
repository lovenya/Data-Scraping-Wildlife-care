Kenya will in November 2019 host the inaugural African Protected Areas Congress (APAC) to discuss conservation of the continent’s protected areas. This comes after the launch of APAC  at the Nairobi National Park’s historic Ivory Burning Site on 14th February 2019.

The congress which  wil be held from 18 - 23 November 2019 is expected to review Africa’s overall progress towards implementing global commitments related to conservation as well as discuss challenges related to biodiversity and showcase inspiring African examples of sustainable solutions that harmonize conservation and human development goals.

Speaking at the launch of the congress, Dr Margaret Mwakima, principal secretary in the State Department of Tourism and Wildlife said: “Africa’s biodiversity hotspots are grappling with threats linked to climate change, human encroachment and invasive species. We are the cradle of biodiversity and wildlife and the November congress will chart a road-map to enhance protection of these natural treasures that are the bedrock of our sustainability agenda.”

Mr Luther Anukur, IUCN Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa said: “APAC is a joint effort from  IUCN - World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA), conservation partners and African leaders. It is expected to contribute to African Union’s Agenda 2063 of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in international arena.”

According to Dr John Waithaka, IUCN-WCPA Regional Chair, the congress will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to develop a united voice in conservation of biodiversity and promoting sustainable development. It will be a moment for the continent to set a common agenda to facilitate action towards greater investment in protected areas so that they can contribute to the regions’ development goals.

The congress is expected to bring together resentatives from all 54 African Governments, NGOs, protected area managers and communities
