Today, the launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration calls us to action. By working ambitiously together and deploying the arsenal of restoration tools at our disposal, we will summon transformative change on a global scale. Together, we can rebuild degraded areas to improve habitat for wildlife, protect our soils and watersheds, engender economic and human health resiliency, and better confront the realities of a changing climate.



IUCN hears the call. 



We will support restoration, spur understanding of the science behind it, and mobilise the political and financial will to dramatically advance restoration on hundreds of millions of hectares in every type of ecosystem, from the mountaintops to the sea floor.



We will restore.
