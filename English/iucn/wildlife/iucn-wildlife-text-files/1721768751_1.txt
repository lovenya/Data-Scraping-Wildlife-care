Five of the imprisoned environmentalists are from IUCN Member organisation Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF) â€“ Niloufar Bayani, Taher Ghadirian, Sepideh Kashani, Houman Jowkar and Morad Tahbaz. Taher Ghadirian and Houman Jowkar are members of the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; Taher Ghadirian is also a member of the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group.

The PWHF conservationists were detained alongside four others, including Amir Hossein Khaleqi, member of the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group, of the IUCN Commission on Education and Communication and of the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas.

IUCN issued a statement of solidarity with them in 2018 and again in 2019, and continues to appeal for their release.
