As at previous CoPs, elephants and ivory trade will be prominent on the agenda. With around 20,000 elephants per year currently slaughtered for the illegal ivory trade, IFAW believes elephants need the highest protection. It is vital to end the ivory trade and prevent any further sales of stockpiled ivory, which can provide a smokescreen for poaching and illegal trade. In Geneva, CITES delegates will also consider the protection of giraffes for the first time. Known as the ‘silent extinction’, giraffe numbers have plummeted by up to 40% over the last 30 years due to threats including international trade in their parts, habitat loss, civil unrest, and illegal hunting. Also under the spotlight will be sharks and rays, whose populations have been declining rapidly due to demand for their fins and meat, with the trade often unregulated locally or globally. A total of 18 of the most threatened of these species will be considered for protection, including both the longfin and shortfin mako shark, which are both endangered. In addition, CoP18 will address how to deal with emerging issues such as the online trade in wildlife, which enables consumers to illegally buy many species of live animals and their parts at the click of a mouse. The conference will also discuss what to do with the ever-increasing number of live animals rescued from traffickers. Matt Collis Deputy Vice President - Policy Policymakers’ decisions about wildlife have to be seen as an integral part of governance—not just an add-on.
