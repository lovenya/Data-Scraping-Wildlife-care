Historic flooding creates need for both animals and people An earthquake affects thousands On the island of Sulawesi, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake has killed at least 42 people, injured hundreds, and left thousands displaced.  Our longtime partner, Centre for Orangutan Protection (COP), has helped set up an animal assistance service center for families to bring their animals for veterinary care and pick up pet food. We’re providing aid to support COP’s efforts of rescuing animals, providing pet food to displaced families, and feeding pets that were left behind. Volcanic activity threatens communities Mt. Merapi, located on the island of Java, is Indonesia’s most active volcano.  It has remained on Alert Level 3 (on a scale of 1-4) since November, 2020.  Eruptions have increased in frequency, spewing hot lava rocks, ash, and volcanic gases over distances of up to three quarters of a mile. With IFAW’s support, COP continues to assist the local community by providing fresh grasses and water to livestock at three evacuation centers. Responders are also assisting with cleaning at the centers and supporting as veterinary assistants.  Feed and pet food are being delivered to families in need, and enclosures have been built as a temporary shelter for pets. We are also providing aid to Animal Friends Jogja, to support their efforts in feeding pets within the evacuation zone, and delivering pet food to families who have lost their incomes. Stay tuned for more updates from these ongoing responses.
