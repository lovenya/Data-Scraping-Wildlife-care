It’s a whale! No, it’s a dolphin! Wait… This might blow you away Food for thought The pod life Both dolphins and baleen whales often travel in groups. This is for safety, as well as to hunt for food. On average, dolphin pods can range from a few individuals to hundreds or thousands because of their very social nature. In contrast, humpback whales tend to be more solitary and travel with only one or two other individuals. The very size of whales makes them less susceptible to attack compared to dolphins. Both species procreate less than other smaller animal—resembling humans in that regard. Dolphins and baleen whales only have one baby at a time, but dolphins give birth every two to three years, while baleen whales might go two to five years or more. In terms of gestation, most dolphins are pregnant for 10-12 months depending on the species, while orcas carry their calves for 18 months! Are they endangered? Like too many animals today, climate change and human encroachment are putting marine mammals in danger. Human-made threats like ship strikes and entanglement in fishing nets are pushing species to the brink of extinction. There are only 9-10 remaining vaquitas left in the world and the Maui dolphin in New Zealand has about 55 individuals remaining. With fewer than 360 individuals left, the North Atlantic right whale is also critically endangered. How you can help Help us protect our ocean and the animals that call it home. IFAW has pioneered field health assessments and treatments for stranded dolphins and whales that enable the animals to not only survive, but thrive after release. Since 1998, we’ve increased our dolphin release rates from 15% to more than 79%. Today, IFAW is a leading expert resource in rescuing stranded and entangled marine animals, sharing our knowledge with other professionals around the world. Together, we’re developing a global stranding network that can help protect marine animals everywhere.
