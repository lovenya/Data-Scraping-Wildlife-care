whales don’t stop to pose unique markings on their heads tracking whales is a national effort Outside government agencies that also conduct aerial surveys of right whales by flying helicopters and planes in a grid-like pattern can also provide critical information as part of whale conservation collaboration. As part of a group initiative, photos get emailed to other central agencies that are members of the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium, which also tracks the whales. The pictures get added to the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog of photo identification curated by the New England Aquarium in Boston. The expansive collection holds more than 73,000 photographed sightings of right whales since 1935. Each whale is assigned a number, and often, a name like Fermata, or Stumpy, or Quasimodo. “We're contributing a small piece to the pie, which helps scientists better understand the status of the right whales, the areas they're using or not using, and where they might be feeding, breeding, or giving birth,” says McLanaghan. “We need to understand everything we can about how they live their lives to be able to better protect them,” he says. “And ultimately, that's what we are trying to do. We are trying to stop their decline and reverse it.”
