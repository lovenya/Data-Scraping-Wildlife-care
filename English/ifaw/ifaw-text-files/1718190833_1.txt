Throughout the night, the rangers checked on the calf and fed her cow's milk they had sourced from neighbouring homes. The following morning, they woke up early to set to work tracking the mother's footprints from where they had left off the previous day. Luckily, the rangers spotted the mother seven kilometers away from the spot where the calf had been rescued. Now it was time to guide the calf back to her mother. Three rangers surrounded her—one on either side of her and another behind—and slowly nudged her toward an open area close to where the ranger had spotted the mother. As soon as the mother was in sight, her calf ran toward her. The pair quickly reunited and walked side by side toward Amboseli. Much to the relief of the patrol team, they were able to confirm that the mother and calf were still together and doing well the following day. The two were seen heading towards a swamp for a drink. In addition to reuniting lost calves with their mothers, the OCWR rangers serve as a critical first line of defense against the poaching and retaliatory killing of giraffes, elephants, lions, cheetahs, and other iconic wildlife in and around Amboseli National Park.
