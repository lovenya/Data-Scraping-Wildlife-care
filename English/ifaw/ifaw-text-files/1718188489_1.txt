Oatley Flora & Fauna Conservation Society (recipient) worked with Greater Sydney Local Land Services (project manager) and numerous local community groups to purchase, install, and monitor water stations for native animals. More than 100 volunteers were trained in constructing and installing the long-term water stations. It was a true example of a community coming together to make a difference for these animals. Thanks to cameras placed around the stations, we now know that at least 24 native species, including kangaroos, possums and wombats and many bird species – have been recorded drinking from the IFAW-supported stations, providing desperate animals with much-needed hydration. Quite literally a life line. What I find particularly interesting is that even once the rain began to fall, wildlife chose the water stations over natural sources because they could seemingly recognize the contamination left behind by ash, silt and mud. The long-lasting impact this initiative will have on various native species in Australia will be shown time and time again as we prepare for another potential bushfire season ahead. This IFAW grant supported the costs of Water for Wildlife stations during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire and drought emergency season. -Josey Sharrad, Wildlife Campaigner, Australia Josey Sharrad Campaigner - Australian Wildlife
