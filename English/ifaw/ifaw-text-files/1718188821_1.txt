History of Kasungu National Park Recovery and livelihood Sewing a vibrant future Today the talented women also support themselves and their families through the sale of beautiful handcrafted goods. Using Singer treadle sewing machines, the Lifupa Women’s Group hand-pick traditional Malawi chitenje fabrics that contribute to a vibrant range of sunhats, hand bags, laptop pouches, and more. Bright and beautiful patterns are what make cotton, wax-dye chitenje so striking. It is a multi-purpose fabric and has a myriad of uses, from being worn as a sarong to swaddling a baby. Every small town has its chitenje market, and everyone has a favorite stallholder. The group operates as a true co-operative. Every woman pays a small annual membership fee and all decision-making happens as a group. Every cent earned goes into a central pot and is shared equally. The 44 women then decide as a group how much they will contribute as additional earnings to the individuals who have done the bulk of the work on a specific project. For women like Sinaya Yusufu, the Lifupa Women's Group has changed their lives. “I was depending on my husband for nearly everything because I had no means of earning an income on my own, " said Yusufu. "But now the story is different because I am able to get my income through tailoring. Through this business, I am empowered economically. I have managed to send my children to school. My husband’s income could not have been enough to educate our children." The Lifupa Women’s Group’s work has helped secure their family’s incomes and future. Children are well fed and thriving at school, seed supplies can be purchased to grow future crops, and there is finally a little money over for life's extras.
