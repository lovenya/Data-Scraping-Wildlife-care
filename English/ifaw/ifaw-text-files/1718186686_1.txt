Any business that allows you to interact with tigers, lions or other big cats for a photo opportunity is not a conservation organization or a true sanctuary, even though they will try to convince you otherwise. So what is a safe selfie? If you love animals and want to share that, take one with a pet or domesticated animal. If you insist on taking photos of the great wildlife you see, take them from a distance, ensuring the safety of you and the animal in the photo. We’re asking you to stand up for animals everywhere. Take our pledge to “Practice #SafeSelfies.” --Kerry Branon
