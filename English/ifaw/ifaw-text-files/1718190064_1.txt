aid to shelter dogs and livestock in flood-hit areas Since the first floods began inundating Pakistan, IFAW supporters have helped us respond immediately to help animals: prior updates >> September 2nd, 2022 Pakistan is currently experiencing its worst flooding in history. Floodwaters have submerged around a third of the country in what is being called a “climate catastrophe.” Local media report more than 3,000 human casualties so far, with hundreds of villages still not accessible to authorities. The unprecedented rainfall has now flooded over two million acres of farmland as well, killing more than 700,000 farm animals. For a country that typically sees three or four rainy periods per year, the eight cycles of monsoon rains that Pakistan has experienced this year is an anomaly. Melting glaciers and glacial lake outbursts, driven by extreme heat and the effects of La Niña, also account for significant flooding and mudslides in multiple districts. In response, IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) has rushed an emergency grant to our local partner, Education, Awareness and Community Health (EACH). The grant supports the purchase and distribution of food for 1,000 cattle and other farm animals belonging to more than 200 families in Chiniot District in the province of Punjab. Today, EACH responders will access several villages previously deemed unsafe by authorities and can begin to assess unmet animal needs. Here are some other ways IFAW is responding to the urgent need in Pakistan: This work is fueled by IFAW supporters. Please make a gift today to support these emergency efforts and protect animals around the world. Keep checking back for more updates.
