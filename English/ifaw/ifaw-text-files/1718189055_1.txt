Next steps for Venus and Cupid The IFAW-sponsored vet team at Friends of the Koala hope through their treatment, Venus will regain sight in at least one eye. Koalas can be released back into the wild with one eye, so there’s hope for Venus. The vet team will continue monitoring her health to see how she progresses. The vets will continue to help Cupid gain strength so he’s the correct weight for a joey and will release him back into the wild when it's time for him to leave his mum.
