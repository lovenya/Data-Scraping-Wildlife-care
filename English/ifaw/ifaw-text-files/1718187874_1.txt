That’s why true sanctuaries are so important to support. This time, IFAW and I visited Lions Tigers and Bears, a true sanctuary accredited by both the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFAS) and the American Sanctuary Association at their gorgeous 93 acre facility just outside Alpine, CA. I met Maverick – a tiger rescued from a famous musician who didn’t have proper permitting or the training to raise a 400lb tiger. I met Hank – who spent the first decade of his life in prison-like conditions at a breeding facility. He’s a white tiger which isn’t a species that occurs naturally in the wild. It’s a result of inbreeding fathers with daughters and granddaughters often resulting in chronic health issues, mental impairments and facial malformations. I met Shadow – a black leopard rescued from a “sanctuary” that had to be shut down after a tiger mauling. Shadow was declawed, resulting in lifelong pain and trouble walking. I met Bobbi – the founder and owner of LTB Sanctuary who dedicates her life to rescuing and protecting these animals. She’s a force and someone I’m so proud to know and support. Although it was so hard to hear about animals suffering such dire and preventable tragedies, it was so inspiring to chat with IFAW’s team about what we can do to fix this. You can help by encouraging your friends and family to support true sanctuaries like Lions Tigers and Bears and steer clear of places that perpetuate a lifetime of suffering for these beautiful creatures. Together, we can get this done. We can protect big cats. Stay tuned and thank you so much for helping! XOXO Minka
