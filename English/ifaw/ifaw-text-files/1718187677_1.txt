The heavy rains over the past few months have erased all traces of the wild animals’ presence. Obeying their migratory instincts, they have temporarily abandoned the area, gracing other regions with their magnificent presence. Water has filled the footprints they had left near the water hole where Nania is bathing – half-sea creature, half-submarine – under Whisty’s wondering gaze. I know that they will be back soon, that it’s a matter of days, but right now, so far from her wild kin, Nania seems to be more of an orphan than ever. Twenty years ago, more than 100 elephants roamed on the park’s 56,000 hectares of land. Today, only 30 to 40 have survived the poaching, overgrazing and conflicts with neighboring settlements. Nania’s mother may be one of them. Help us find her! -Céline Sissler-Bienvenu, France & Francophone Africa Director Céline Sissler-Bienvenu Director – European Disaster Response
