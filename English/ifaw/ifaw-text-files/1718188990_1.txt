The last few weeks have been very eventful for IFAW’s EU team. The EU institutions have taken several political decisions that will have a direct impact on the conservation and welfare of wild animals. Of note are the agreements on the texts of the landmark Nature Restoration Law and the revision to the Environmental Crime Directive. Both laws represent a step forward. However, the compromises between the institutions also mean that shortcomings remain. IFAW will continue to work to close any remaining gaps. Together with its partners, IFAW has taken stock of the situation one year after the revision of the EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking. In addition, IFAW has also set up a global e-learning platform that will enable law enforcement officials to better deal with confiscated wildlife species. Finally, the COP28 climate conference closed last week. IFAW was on site and championing the role of nature, and specifically animals, as a solution to the climate crisis. Read our assessment of the conference and its results below. At the end of this year, it is a good time to reflect on victories for animals in 2023. Check out our summary video. And now all that remains is for us to thank our partners and supporters for their excellent cooperation. We wish you happy holidays and a peaceful New Year. In November 2023, following challenging negotiations, the EU institutions agreed on the Nature Restoration Law, aiming for a minimum of 20% restoration of EU land and sea by 2030. This is a major milestone for the protection of nature and wildlife. While commendable expansions were made, loopholes might hinder efforts, especially in preventing deterioration. Concerns remain about its effectiveness due to compromises diluting key aspects and offering member states more flexibility. Also in November, the EU completed the revision of the Environmental Crime Directive, broadening the scope of offences and imposing higher penalties for serious, long-lasting, and irreversible ecosystem damage. IFAW welcomed the updated directive which now also includes measures for a wider range of environmental crimes, improved implementation strategies, and specific thresholds and sanctions. Notably, it addresses for the first time underwater noise pollution impacting marine mammals, a change supported by IFAW. Unfortunately, maximum limits for penalties and sanctions on environmental crimes remain inadequate. In November's plenary session, the European Parliament adopted its position on revising the Ship-Source Pollution Directive. IFAW appreciated this move due to the alarming rise in maritime transport-related pollution over recent decades. While acknowledging the incorporation of several recommendations into the text, IFAW noted that the Directive's scope remains limited, and the number of enforceable measures falls short. In Brussels on November 16, representatives from Member States, the EU Commission, the European Parliament, experts, and civil society convened to mark one year since the publication of the Revised EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking. Discussions highlighted progress, urging dedicated implementation, and addressing challenges such as care for confiscated animals, enforcement hurdles, and legislative gaps enabling illegal species entry into the EU. The COP28 climate change conference in Dubai marked a significant shift towards integrating nature into global climate strategies. IFAW's experts highlighted a pivotal shift towards including biodiversity in global climate strategies, emphasizing the crucial role of animals in combating climate breakdown. While recognizing the importance of protecting ecosystems, urgent action remains paramount for an integrated approach merging climate and biodiversity agendas. Law enforcement agencies globally can now access a pioneering online learning initiative focused on safely and compassionately handling live animals seized in illegal trade. This program developed by IFAW and several partners aids law enforcement officers in safe confiscation practices. Available or soon to be offered in eight languages, it aims for widespread accessibility. The courses are hosted through IFAW's Academy of Rescue and Conservation and are exclusively accessible to authorized law enforcement agencies. To mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction on 13 October, EurActiv published an op-ed by Staci McLennan, Director of Policy, Europe. Among other things, the author called for animal welfare to be recognised as part of the response to emergencies and disasters. As 2023 draws to a close, let us reflect on ten impactful ways your support has empowered us to safeguard and preserve animals throughout this year. Through the generosity of our supporters, IFAW facilitated the transportation of a dozen big cats from conflict-affected regions in Ukraine, inaugurated a new Dolphin Rescue Center, and provided swift aid in response to global disasters. -- Download the December 2023 issue of the newsletter. As we return from summer, for many a time to connect with nature, Europe and the world have been reminded that failure to protect nature not only contributes to biodiversity loss it comprises our best defence to climate change-induced natural disasters. The EU Nature Restoration Law, perhaps the most important piece of EU biodiversity legislation in the last 30 years, comes at a time of the rapidly progressing and mutually reinforcing triple crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation. Yet it only passed in a narrow vote this July, and upcoming negotiations will be crucial. IFAW will join forces with other stakeholders to ensure this vital tool of the European Green Deal is adopted. With our vision for Room to Roam, IFAW participated in the Africa Climate Summit this September where nations collectively acknowledged the value of nature and biodiversity for African development and the vital fight against climate change. All eyes will now turn to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) kicks off in Dubai this November. For more on IFAW’s priorities, check out 8 nature-based climate solutions that protect our planet. Sadly, this summer was a stark reminder that disasters are escalating in frequency and severity around the world. IFAW recently responded to the ecological disaster resulting from wildfires in Greece and we’re rushing aid and supplies to Morocco and Libya following a recent earthquake, storm, and dam failure. IFAW knows that helping animals impacted by disasters can contribute to nature’s recovery as illustrated by this beautiful success story of a koala bushfire survivor spotted back in the wild with her second joey! Read more about our latest work below. And please don’t forget to add your name to the more than 85,500 signatories who have supported our Blue Speeds campaign to protect Europe’s marine life. With over 80% of European habitats deteriorated, the Nature Restoration Law aims to restore ecosystems, habitats and species across the EU’s land and sea. The goal is to enable long-term and sustained recovery of ecosystem health and bolster resilience against climate change. IFAW launched a new report this month, identifying the scale and economic value of the trade in shark products by the EU and spotlighting a potential lack of enforcement and underreporting of illegal trade by Member States. Not only is the scale of the trade staggering, but the EU also seems to provide a platform for transit of illegal shark products. In June, the citizens of the EU will exercise their democratic rights by heading to the polls to elect their representatives for the European Parliament. We call for decisive actions by policymakers in 2024 and beyond, with the goal of creating a better world for animals, people, and the planet. The information we receive from Jack’s GPS collar is integral to our Room to Roam initiative. With every ping of Jack’s GPS, we learn about the dynamics and travel habits of his herd. By pinpointing their routes, we can ensure those specific areas remain accessible and safe into the future. Currently, most climate investments focus on emissions reduction, carbon removal, or adaptation. Yet investment in nature is the most effective tool we have to address the climate crisis. To sustain the level of impact we’ve had to date, new approaches and partnerships can drive solutions forward. The world’s largest land animal faces many threats, and so do the people who live alongside them.

Since the time of our last newsletter, important international policy decisions were taken at 19th Conference of the Parties (CoP19) of CITES and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in late 2022, pushing forward steps to protect species and restore biodiversity: In the first months of 2023, the health of our oceans has been a top priority: The year ahead promises to focus increasingly on climate change and disaster resilience: Read more below! In February 2022, under intense bombing, Ukrainian families grabbed their pets and anything they could carry and fled to Poland and other neighboring countries. After one year of giving aid, the war is ongoing and IFAW must constantly adapt to tackle the changing needs on the ground, guided by one unwavering principle: Helping animals also helps those who care about them. What's next? From wildfires to floods that have ravaged parts of Europe, disaster events damage infrastructure, cause significant economic losses and claim lives. Adding to it the crisis of war, and environmental impacts yet to be understood. Humans are not alone in facing the outcomes of disasters; animals and wildlife are impacted by these events and endure the aftermath that can produce widespread death, habitat fragmentation and destruction. See how animals matter and what the EU can do here. After nearly two decades of talks, United Nations member states have agreed on a legal framework aimed at greater protection and management of the open ocean. Once in force, the UN High Seas Treaty will enable the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas—the parts of the ocean that lie outside of national boundaries and cover half of our planet’s surface. This represents the largest habitat on Earth, home to millions of species, and our greatest ally against climate change. Read more here. As we take a look back on 2022, we were inspired by many significant ways in which people have helped animals over the past year. Big cats, elephants, blue whales, orangutans and sharks all feature in our past year’s efforts to conserve, rescue and protect individuals, populations and species around the globe. Enjoy and share here. This March, IFAW and MEP Michal Wiezik (Renew Europe) organized a screening of the documentary film Wolf at the European Parliament in Brussels. In a political context, where the return of wolves to regions in Europe where they had been absent for decades remains a highly controversial issue, the documentary presents the crucial role of the apex predator in preserving our biodiversity. Lessons of coexistence apply to wildlife in Europe as well as Africa where IFAW is implementing Room to Roam. Learn more about IFAW’s collaboration here. The EU Action Plan on “Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient fisheries” was published by the EU Commission in February. This long-awaited document aims to make EU fisheries more resilient, encouraging sustainable fishing practices while ensuring that fishing interests contribute to the protection and restoration of the marine ecosystems on which they depend. But does it lack true ambition to see it through? Learn more here. -- Download the May 2023 issue of the newsletter. Underwater noise pollution has been impacting marine mammals for decades. The increasing number of ships travelling across the seas is disrupting the underwater lives of these animals and putting their survival at risk. IFAW has come up with a realistic, quick-to-implement and effective solution: reduce shipping speeds (aka blue speeds). The latest economic research shows that in addition to reducing to ocean noise, the risk of ship strikes and greenhouse gas emissions, blue speeds could also lead to an estimated 4.5 billion euros in socioeconomic benefits. Read more about our Blue Speeds Campaign below and sign the petition calling on European institutions to adopt Blue Speeds, an EU-wide measure for the implementation of slower ship speeds as a condition of entry into European ports. Around the world, disasters are escalating in frequency and severity. In Europe, severe flooding hit Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sicily in 2021, and summer heat waves and wildfires scorched France and other countries in southern Europe in 2021 and 2022. Launched on 13 October, the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, IFAW’s report Beyond Rescue: Animals in Disasters – Europe finds that current humanitarian models of disaster management in Europe neglect the inclusion of animals in policies and planning, thus endangering the lives of people and animals. This is why IFAW is advocating for critical policy changes to include animals in disaster. Our team continues to combat wildlife crime in Europe. Following our advocacy efforts, the adoption last summer of the Digital Services Act sets the foundation to tackle wildlife cybercrime. Looking to Southeast Asia, the EU is funding the Partners against Wildlife Crime initiative where IFAW organized a workshop to share lessons learned and best practices in counter wildlife cybercrime efforts. While progress is being made to fight wildlife trafficking our latest joint report Stolen Wildlife revealed the EU continues to be a main hub and destination for wildlife, which has been ‘stolen’ from Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania. Speed reduction for commercial ships entering and leaving EU waters could bring up to 4.5 billion Euros in socioeconomic benefits, along with having a sizable effect in to reduce noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and the risk of collision with whales. Read the IFAW-commissioned independent CE Delft study here. A new report released by IFAW finds that an increase in the frequency and severity of disasters in Europe requires critical policy changes to address the impact on animals. Read more here. The European Parliament urged the European Commission and Member States to take a stronger stand against illegal wildlife trade and to further protect threatened species at CITES CoP19.

This joint report exposes European complicity in illegal wildlife trade, with EU citizens not only being involved in the smuggling of nationally protected wildlife, but also perpetuating the market for these animals. Read more here. -- Download the November 2022 issue of the newsletter. As summer arrives and many prepare for holidays, it is time to reflect on both the challenges and accomplishments of these last months. We find ourselves at a pivotal time in Europe and globally. How we move forward will have profound impacts on animals, people and the places we call home. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, IFAW’s Disaster Response team, together with our partners, has been at the forefront of the crisis providing urgent support to animals. We have worked to support refugees and their pets, fund shelters and zoos in need of critical supplies, and aid with animal rescues. More than 42,000 companion and wild animals, predominately cats and dogs, and wild animals like bears, bats and tigers have been directly helped. We have seen first-hand that the lack of awareness, training and recognition of the role of animals in Disaster Response policy can hamper the capacity of civil protection and veterinary services to offer timely and critical aid. IFAW will advocate to rectify this significant gap in European policy. Below you can read a first-hand account of our Communications Manager who deployed near the Ukrainian border, as well as, an IFAW report Animals, people and war: the impact of conflict. This edition of our EU newsletter includes our latest Annual Report highlighting incredible stories and successes. One such story takes place in IFAW funded leased habitat in the Panda Masuie Forest Reserve in Zimbabwe. In this reserve located in the network of protected areas of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, four rescued and rehabilitated orphaned elephant calves successfully began living among wild elephant herds. The released elephants are tracked with collars to provide insights into their integration in the wild. In early June 2022, there was further good news for elephant conservation, as the UK ban on ivory trade adopted over 3.5 years earlier finally came into force. Now we look ahead and focus our work on the revision of the Environmental Crime Directive, the adoption of the Digital Services Act to help tackle wildlife cybercrime and calling for strong EU leadership at the CITES 19th Conference of the Parties (CoP 19) in Panama this November. We wish you a rejuvenating summer break and look forward to meeting in-person this autumn to work together to protect animals, people and the places we call home. IFAW has remained steadfast in our dedication to protecting animals, people & the places we call home. Read about incredible stories & successes from the past year in our annual report.

We first ended 2021 with the adoption of the long awaited European Commission’s new rules severely restricting trade in ivory. While there is more work to be done to protect elephants, this was a great step after so many years of hard work and a success to celebrate for IFAW and all our supporters.

With the slow return of the sun, we look forward to more happening in 2022. A good omen has been the adoption of the European Parliament’s position on the Digital Services Act, which will introduce new transparency requirements for companies that will make the detection of illegal wildlife products and law enforcement easier. Iceland has also announced the historic end of whaling for 2024, after over 20 years of campaigning by IFAW in the country.

Between the revision of the EU Wildlife Trafficking Action Plan and of the Environmental Crime Directive, this year has crucial topics on the EU agenda and we hope to celebrate more victories for animals and our planet.

To begin with, this month, IFAW released a new report on the global shark trade and the major role the EU plays in it. We are working hard to make sure that wish for our recommendations are heard and that strong international measures will be taken at international level during the CITES Conference of the Parties, planned at the end of the year.

We hope the content of this new edition of our newsletter interests you and as always, we remain available to discuss any issues further with you.

As we all look forward to the summer, stretching in the sunlight from the confinement of this past year, we finally feel hope for the future. The spread of vaccines and a stronger international political will on environmental issues seem to confirm it. The end of captive breeding and canned hunting of lions in South Africa, a potential ban on EU ivory trade, the steep decline in demand for seal products, or the upcoming UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP 15) in October in China, are among the things to follow. With this fourth issue of our newsletter, we wanted to share with you some of the latest work on wildlife cybercrime, the Belgian government’s efforts to tackle underwater noise, continued threats to harp seals, and detection dogs sniffing out wildlife crime in Benin.

We had high expectations for 2020, especially when it comes to biodiversity, but things went rogue and a global pandemic – a result of our unhealthy relationship with nature, shook us to the core. Despite these unprecedented challenges, our work never stopped and IFAW achieved some great successes in 2020. We also witnessed positive developments at the European level with the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030, the agreement on the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) for 2021-2027, and the recognition of the need for a Marine Action Plan to restore marine ecosystems. We are now looking forward with hope and ready to make this year a strong stepping-stone for sustainable and meaningful change. Nature will not allow us another decade of failures, so let’s get to work! 2020 was meant to be the ‘Super Year of Biodiversity’ but things went sideways, though some sparks of hope occurred.

It has been seven months since COVID-19 was officially declared as a pandemic, our lives have been changed, and we must shift towards a new way of living, working, consuming and engaging with our environment. This second issue of our newsletter will indeed discuss our relationship with wildlife, which was a key factor that led us to the immensely tenuous situation we find ourselves in today. Our latest report “Beyond COVID-19” addresses that fact and discusses a wide range of actions to change the way we interact with our environment. Some of these actions are at the core of our international policy work, especially at the European level. As the EU looks at ways to build back better and greener, the EU Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 offer ambitious prospects for the future that must be aligned with external action. IFAW’s Director of International Policy, Matthew Collis, outlines the important role of EU leadership in this newsletter. We are calling for programme and funding to protect biodiversity in the new EU budget. Our rescue efforts in the California wildfires or the patrol missions of our Team Lioness in Kenya can only be sustainable with the support of proper policies and sufficient funding to address wildlife and conservation issues. The role of the EU will be central in this regard, so that animals and people can thrive together.
