Communities are at the heart of our conservation approach For decades, IFAW has placed community engagement at the core of our work across the Room to Roam landscapes in Africa. In no other area of our work is healthy coexistence between people and animals more urgent and critical. Our efforts are solidly based on listening and learning, partnership and local leadership, inclusive participation, sustainable impact, and evidence-based engagement. Many conservation efforts have relied on solutions that are externally created and managed, which is often costly and short-term. We see a better way. We engage with those living closest to the animals and habitats we strive to protect to ensure positive and sustained change. We believe that protecting critical habitats drives long-term benefits for both wildlife and people. We embed conservation actions into local society, and culture and enhance leadership and participation at the grassroots level. It’s a bottom-up approach to create locally defined solutions for locally defined challenges. Examples of these collaborations have included empowering landowners, scholarship programs, skills building, improving life-giving water supplies, and other transformation and impact. We are committed to working respectfully and collaboratively with communities to find lasting solutions that work for wildlife, people and the animals under their stewardship. Next week we join APAC in bringing governments, private sector, civil society, academia and Indigenous Peoples & Local Communities together in important conversations that will help shape Africa’s future.
