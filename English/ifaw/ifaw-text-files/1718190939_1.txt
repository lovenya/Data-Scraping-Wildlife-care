Additionally, IFAW plans to deliver pet food to shelters, pet volunteers, and rescue teams in Mykolaiv and finance two veterinary ambulances—one in Mykolaiv and one in central Ukraine. We’re also expanding our work to new regions in central and south Ukraine to increase veterinary support, and we plan to ship up to 30 tons of pet food to the Mykolaiv region in the coming weeks to support evacuated animals. IFAW has been working with partner organizations in Ukraine since February 2022, providing support to shelters, rehabilitation centers, and other teams working on the ground to rescue, evacuate, and provide lifesaving veterinary care to animals affected by the conflict.
