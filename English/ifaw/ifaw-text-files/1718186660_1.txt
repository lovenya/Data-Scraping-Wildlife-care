Why can’t we dye elephant tusks or rhino horns pink? Dye grows out of tusks and horns Sedation distresses the animals Water source dyes are disruptive Why don’t you poison rhino horns? “Pure” rhino horn demand would increase Logistical issues makes it nearly impossible to implement Why not just safely dehorn and remove tusks from rhinos and elephants? Horn and tusk stumps are still valuable on the black market Horns and tusks are important for rhino and elephant survival
