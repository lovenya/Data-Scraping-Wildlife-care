To address many of those threats, IFAW works on the frontlines of animal protection, from fighting wildlife crime to conserving key habitats to rescuing and rehabilitating injured and orphaned animals. This year, we have selected ten of our most powerful images of wildlife from the past year to commemorate World Wildlife Day. These wildlife photos include translocated elephants and giraffes, rescued orphan koalas and a critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. These photos, and the incredible stories behind them, highlight the plights that species and individual animals face in their ecosystems, and also offer a glimpse into the lifesaving work of IFAW and our partners that keeps wildlife around the globe safe.
