In the first few weeks after the war began, several trains came in every 24 hours, each carrying hundreds of people and pets. “When a train arrived, it was all hands on deck,” says Veronika. “We would spend two to three hours processing all the animals non-stop, giving them vaccinations, chipping them and filling out paperwork. Most of the animals coming through were dogs and cats, and the one thing they all had in common is that they were very, very stressed.” Veronika was able to bring some ease to the minds of pets and owners. “It was easy for me to have a quick chat with people when they came in to explain to them what we were doing and why, as many refugees were weary after the difficulties they faced while trying to flee their country as they passed numerous Russian checkpoints. It made treating their animals and making sure they got the care they needed that much easier.” IFAW is equally grateful for Veronika’s incredible dedication and unwavering commitment. “She really impressed us with her stamina, solving any problem she came across and doing it all with a positive and optimistic mindset,” says Sissler-Bienvenu. “We are therefore very excited to welcome Veronika as a fulltime IFAW employee.” Veronika will work as operations coordinator for IFAW’s rescue efforts in Ukraine. She will be in charge of implementing project activities aimed at mitigating the effects of the war on animals and developing better welfare measures during the recovery phase. “I am so happy to be able to continue helping my country and the animals that so desperately need our help,” she says.
