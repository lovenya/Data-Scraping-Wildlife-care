A nose unlike any other As part of Operation Jaguar, detection dogs will be trained to use their superb sense of smell to help track down jaguar parts and ultimately disrupt wildlife trafficking. IFAW has enlisted the help of Wesley Visscher of Scent Imprint Conservation Dogs, who has trained his dogs Bruce and Boris specifically in detecting jaguar parts. ARTIS Zoo in Amsterdam, who have a jaguar enclosure, assisted him with that. They allowed the dogs to meet the jaguars from a safe distance, and provided samples of jaguar teeth and urine to familiarize the dogs with the scent. During the training, the Labrador retriever and Patterdale terrier are placed in different environments where they try to track jaguar scents from boxes, packages, cars and containers. “Since dogs are fond of playing, the scent sample is sometimes also applied to a toy. This way, the dog thinks that he is looking for his toy and will be extra motivated to find it,” says Wesley. Next steps for Bruce and Boris The exact destination of the mission remains a secret, but soon the Dutch detection dogs Bruce and Boris will leave for South America. They will be deployed to sea ports and airports, where they will sniff packages, luggage and vehicles in search of jaguar parts. Here, the dogs will become critical members of our team, helping to expose poachers and smugglers, and make a real difference for jaguars.
