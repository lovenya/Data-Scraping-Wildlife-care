IFAW funds workshop for Somaliland Veterinarians The training consisted of lectures and hands-on practical sessions covering physical examination, emergency care principles, syndromes of disease when re-feeding a malnourished animal, dietary insufficiencies, and preventative care. The veterinarians were taught about Somalilandâ€™s laws forbidding poaching and trade, the importance of keeping cheetahs in the wild, and the need to promote conservation of wildlife through education and engagement with local communities. A second training session is planned on 19-22 February with eight veterinary doctors from the Somali Regional State of Ethiopia. The goal of the two trainings is to develop a network of veterinarians trained in cheetah care on both sides of the Ethiopia-Somaliland border in areas where illegal trade and conflict are known to occur most frequently.
