Full-circle approach to help koalas This crucial habitat restoration work is part of IFAW’s full-circle approach to conservation in Australia. Through our expertise and network of wildlife carers, we help to rescue injured animals and provide the critical resources for their rehabilitation so they can be released back into the wild where they belong. But for rehabilitated animals to be released back into the wild, they need safe places to call home. That’s where we all have a part to play. This isn’t a problem fixed by one individual or group. We all need to work together to be part of the solution. How you can help: This National Tree Day, we’re asking you to post a photo or video of yourself on Instagram and tell us why #WeNeedTrees. Tag three friends or family members and get them involved so we can show the world why trees are vital.
