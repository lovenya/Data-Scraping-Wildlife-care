including animals in disaster plans Recently, a training event held on the nearby island of Bali on International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (October 13, 2022) focused on including animals in disaster preparedness. Residents of Bonyoh, a small town on the island situated between two volcanos, gathered to practice evacuation and first response techniques created by the local Community Disaster Management Group. They also participated in exercises to construct emergency shelters and safely load and unload cows and goats from evacuation vehicles. The training was a collaboration between IFAW and the Bali Animal Welfare Association. “Many individuals or families refuse to leave their animals behind when evacuation orders are given. Including animals in disaster plans in communities like Bonyoh can mean the difference between life and death for some people,” says Gardner.
