The rescuers stayed with Washburn in the back of the vehicle and monitored her health on the drive to the short-term rehabilitation facility in Connecticut. Everyone was hoping she would bounce back. Several hours later she was swimming freely in the warm pool at Mystic Aquarium and by morning she was munching as much romaine lettuce and spinach as she could get into her mouth—all good signs. She continued to make gains and then a few days later a routine ultrasound revealed something amazing; Washburn was pregnant! Four days after the rescue, thermometers near Washburn Island registered 67 degrees Fahrenheit. The team breathed a sigh of relief knowing they saved Washburn and her expecting calf in the nick of time. Watch the rescue here. The ultimate goal was to release Washburn back to the wild in her usual habitat off the coast of Florida; after swimming north all summer, she needed some time to rest and eat. A few more weeks of care and she was strong enough to head home. How would Washburn make the 1,200 mile journey back? A special flight was arranged for her on a Coast Guard airplane. After five hours in the air in a cushioned transportation crate, one last short stay in rehabilitation and a lot more lettuce, she was fitted with temporary satellite tag and released back out to the wild off the East Coast of Volusia County, Florida in an area known for its abundance of seagrass—one of manatees’ favorite food sources. Wildlife experts immediately began monitoring her progress and she was spotted swimming south, all the way to the Bahamas in late November. That is more than 300 miles! Everyone will be on the look-out for a healthy newborn manatee calf in the spring. — Kerry Branon
