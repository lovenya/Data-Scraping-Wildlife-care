Gray seals (Halichoerus grypus): Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina): Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus): Hooded seals (Cystophora cristata): What if I see stranded seals on Cape Cod? It is common for seals to haul out on land, either by themselves or in a group, to rest. It is not necessary for seals to be wet and they can go for days without eating, so beachgoers should not attempt to feed or wet a seal on land. In fact, seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act which recommends staying at least 150 feet away. The law makes it illegal to hunt, feed, disturb, or otherwise harass any marine mammal. It is also important to remember that seals are wild animals. All seals have sharp teeth and claws; they also can carry diseases that are transmittable to both pets and humans. DO NOT approach them or push them back into the water! Read even more facts about seals and how the IFAW organization began by saving seals 50 years ago. Allison Hardman was an intern with the IFAW Marine Mammal Rescue and Research team based at IFAW headquarters. Allison has interned with several stranding organizations from Maine to Virginia rescuing stranded animals, providing care at rehabilitation facilities, and participating in outreach events and research initiatives. At IFAW she assisted the team with responses to live dolphins and seals and data collection from dead stranded animals.
