Physical injury from wildfires Loss of habitat One of the most dangerous aspects of wildfires is their ability to spread quickly and wipe out critical habitat. Wildfires can burn through a forest at a speed of 10 kilometers (6 miles) an hour. Loss of habitat greatly impacts all animals. Species that annually return to the same breeding ground and nesting sites are especially threatened by wildfires. In some cases, it can take years for a species to recover after missing a breeding season and reestablishing a secure home. Limited food and water sources Food sources are often destroyed or contaminated during wildfires, leaving wildlife with no choice but to enter a new territory beyond their home range. As the animals travel in search of food and habitat, they are at risk of additional threats like vehicle strikes, attacks from domestic pets, and new predators. Once they arrive at a new territory, they often face territorial disputes and have to compete with other animals over limited resources. In times of disasters like wildfires, it’s very common to see wildlife in unusual places as they disperse in search of resources and safe land. What you can do to protect wildlife from wildfires
