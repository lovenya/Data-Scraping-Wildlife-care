Restoring a crucial wildlife corridor Being a part of the solution While these community projects are key to helping our wildlife, they also instill a desire for local landowners to be part of the solution. IFAW is committed to being a part of the solution by ensuring our work involves not only rescue and rehabilitation but recovery and restoration. Our Northern Rivers project – like many others – includes a combination of rescue, rehabilitation, landscape conservation, and policy work to secure a sustainable future for our wildlife and planet. Our work has continued as we partner with more groups to expand our restoration efforts, including the Great Eastern Ranges, a large-scale conservation initiative to restore and reconnect 3,600km of land from Far North Queensland to Western Victoria. Finding ways for people and animals to co-exist This investment in restoration and regrowth – much like our commitment to securing the migration routes of elephants in Africa and India and whales in the north Atlantic, Indian Ocean and more - will support generations of animals to come. Just as koalas could once be spotted in the wild, elephants used to travel freely across unpopulated lands in Africa and North Atlantic right whales once lived full and productive lives. Now, the future survival of all three species is under threat. Koalas could become extinct by 2050 if they aren’t given greater protections and a secured habitat. We could lose Africa’s elephants in the next 40 years if rates of habitat loss combined with deaths from poaching continue. If right whales continue to be exposed to ship collisions and net entanglements, we will lose them. Now, more than ever, we must find successful ways to co-exist with and protect our wildlife. Together with our partners, we’re on the ground connecting protected spaces to create the room these species need to roam. Our goal is to increase the chances of survival of our wildlife and help animals and people thrive together.
