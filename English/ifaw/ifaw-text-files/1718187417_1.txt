In July 2018, IFAW took over the management of the Group Ranch community rangers and by extension the security of wildlife in the Group Ranch. While officially handing over the newly-constructed structures to the community rangers, IFAW President and CEO Azzedine Downes stated that he was greatly pleased to be offering solutions to wildlife security by ensuring that those charged with wildlife protection are comfortable and are best placed to do their work as efficiently as possible. He gave his word that the community wildlife rangers would at the very least have a warm place to rest, a warm meal at the end of the day and a paycheck at the end of every month to cater for theirs’ and their families’ needs. Improving the working conditions of the community rangers has a positive impact on their health conditions and their performance. These rangers have the arduous responsibility of providing the first line of defense for Amboseli’s elephants and other wildlife -Jacqueline Nyagah, IFAW Communications Manager This blog was produced for the Strengthening Community Support for Law Enforcement and Anti-Poaching Efforts in the Greater Kilimanjaro Trans Frontier Conservation Area (TFCA) project, which is co-funded by the European Union and implemented by IFAW in partnership with African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) and Big Life Foundation.
