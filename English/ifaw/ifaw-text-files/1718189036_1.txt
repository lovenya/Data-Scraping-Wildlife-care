Phytoplankton: the hidden workers that feed our oceans That’s not all—they also fight climate change By now, we’re all aware of the consequences of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. With the burning of fossil fuels practically everywhere we look, excessive CO2 emissions are contributing to rising global temperatures, impacts on human health and changing ecosystems. We’re already seeing the consequences in our ocean. Warming waters and rising acidity levels are killing coral reefs, dissolving crustacean shells, and disrupting the balance for marine life. Luckily, phytoplankton are saving the day, yet again! And it’s all thanks to their role in the ocean’s carbon cycle. Similar to plants, phytoplankton capture large amounts of CO2 and convert it to useable cellular energy. Not only does this remove carbon from the atmosphere, but it also produces the oxygen that animals need to survive. When phytoplankton are eaten by other marine animals, the carbon continues to pass through the food web. If phytoplankton die before becoming a meal, they sink to the ocean floor, storing and locking away the carbon they’ve absorbed. Through this process known as the “biological pump”, billions of metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere are transferred to the bottom of the ocean every year, where its environmental impact is reduced. Thank you, whale poop So, let’s review what we’ve learned. Whale poop feeds phytoplankton, the tiny marine algae that produce more than half of the world’s oxygen. Phytoplankton feed small fish, who work their way up the food chain to feed larger animals like sharks and dolphins. More animals in the ocean means more biodiversity and a healthy functioning ecosystem (that we are responsible for actively protecting). Add in the phytoplankton's ability to transfer and store mass amounts of carbon, and the ocean acts as our greatest ally in the fight against climate change. Whale poop to the rescue!
