The sanctuaries reported that most of their infrastructure was destroyed and they suffered a loss of power, food and clean water, but fortunately their animals were safe. One of the sanctuaries, Little Bear Sanctuary located in Punta Gorda, provided us with a somber assessment of the damage caused by Hurricane Ian. Its founders chose to remain onsite to protect the 200 animals, including cows, horses, donkeys, pigs and birds, in their care. Flood waters drenched the sanctuary while 135 mph winds leveled all animal shelters and infrastructure and uprooted several large trees. The animals are currently safe, but in dire need of shelters and supplies. Both wildlife rehabilitators reached out to IFAW through the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council to request emergency support as they are overwhelmed with wildlife in need of care and rehabilitation. Florida is incredibly rich in biodiversity, with over 4,300 known animal species, 269 of which are endemic. One rehabilitator said she’s received an influx of orphaned baby squirrels, opossums and rabbits due to the devastation brought by Hurricane Ian. During the 2019 Australia bushfires, we identified a significant gap in disaster recovery efforts—many larger organizations receive the first and largest donations while smaller organizations or individual rehabilitators are often missed in the wake of these disasters. IFAW bridges this gap by supporting small organizations and individuals who dedicate their lives and personal funds to ensure wild animals are given a chance at life back in the wild. Recovery from Hurricane Ian will take months or years. We’re committed to helping as much as we can.
