wildlife rehab is priority as flood recovery efforts continue After spending three full weeks on the ground with Kentucky River Regional Animal Shelter (KRRAS) to help manage donated supplies for local communities, care for shelter animals, and reunite cats and dogs with their owners, IFAW responders have returned home. IFAW has awarded additional emergency grant funds to Starfish Animal Rescue to assist with the transport of surrendered pets to receiving shelters, and to Animal Disaster Relief Coalition (ADRC) to support animal search and rescue, daily care of shelter dogs and cats, and the distribution of pet supplies. We continue to help cover veterinary expenses for displaced families and KRRAS shelter animals. As Eastern Kentucky shifts from crisis mode to recovery, we continue to support planning at state and local levels to build resilience. IFAW deployed responders in Kentucky to help with animal search and rescue August 2, 2022 On Thursday, 28 July 2022, heavy rains kicked off catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the state and has killed at least 37 people. Entire counties are devastated and continue to experience flash floods, landslides and mudslides. More rainfall is expected to continue throughout this week. Today, IFAW deployed trained responders in Eastern Kentucky to help with animal search and rescue and emergency sheltering. Local authorities requested our support in four of the hardest hit counties of Perry, Knott, Letcher, and Breathitt and we immediately activated our team. Stay tuned as we share updates from our team in Kentucky.
