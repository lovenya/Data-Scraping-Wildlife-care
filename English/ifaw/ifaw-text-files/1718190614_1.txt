The contest is part of World Wildlife Day, held every March 3 to celebrate the world’s endangered animals and plants and how they contribute to the betterment of the planet. This year, March 3 also marks the 50th anniversary of CITES. “These young artists of all ages have reminded us that today is an occasion where we acknowledge the importance of all wildlife species—especially those threatened or endangered—around the world and how critical partnerships are in ensuring their continued survival for generations to come,” said Downes. The plight of endangered species is a sad reality, but Downes highlights that people have the power to make a difference for wildlife. “It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the negative news that you hear every day in the media,” he said. “I want to leave you with a message of hope. There are things we can do. We can do them as individuals and we can save lives through organizations like IFAW.”
