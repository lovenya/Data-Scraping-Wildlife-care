Today, our MMRR team has six full-time staff members, one full-time veterinarian, one part-time veterinarian, two apprentices, multiple interns, and a highly trained corps of 224 volunteers. We are dedicated to rescuing stranded marine mammals on a 700 miles stretch of coastline on Cape Cod and southeastern MA ­— a global mass stranding hot spot. Along with our daily work on Cape Cod, our marine mammal experts often travel across the globe to countries such as India, Oman, and New Zealand to host trainings and share our extensive research. Our local work and travels have enabled us to rescue an impressive list of 23 marine species, including minke whales, bottlenose dolphins, Risso’s dolphins, manatees, harp seals, gray seals, and harbor porpoises. As we celebrate our 20-year anniversary and 5,000th animal response, I can’t help but feel immensely honored to be a member of this amazing team and incredibly grateful for the support we receive from IFAW staff, volunteers, and supporters. After years of innovation and scientific research, we have increased our successful release rate of mass stranded dolphins from 3% in 1999 to now over 86% so far in 2018. Our team has pushed the boundaries of marine mammal rescue and developed new techniques that are advancing rescue and conservation efforts around the world. There is still much work to be done to safeguard the welfare of marine mammals in our oceans, but today we celebrate our victories and the four dolphins who received a second chance at life in the wild.
