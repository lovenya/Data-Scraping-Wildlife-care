As the film conveys, poisoning wolves is not only a short-sighted and ineffective measure to protect caribou, but it’s also exceptionally cruel. When wolves consume these poisons, they experience seizures and agitation, their muscles spasm painfully and their hearts, lungs and other vital organs eventually shut down. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Canadian Council on Animal Care have all concluded that strychnine and Compound 1080 are inhumane and inappropriate for use on wolves because they cause unacceptable suffering. Poisoned baits kill not-target animals too, including endangered species, because there is no way to control which animals encounter them (or feed on the carcass of a poisoned animal). All in all, it is impossible to know the true number of animals killed by strychnine and Compound 1080, as sickened wild animals tend to hide, and their carcasses are quickly scavenged during the winter. If Canada wants to be a credible champion of biodiversity, we need to stop poisoning predators and start protecting habitats. Canada needs effective caribou protection—not a cruel wolf cull. We need you to make your voice heard. Please let the Government of Canada know that you oppose the use of cruel and inhumane poisons to kill wolves and other wildlife.
