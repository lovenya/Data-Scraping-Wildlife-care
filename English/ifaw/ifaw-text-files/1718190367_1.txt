Coexistence with large carnivores is possible as livestock protection measures have proven to be effective solutions to reduce or prevent the risk of an attack. Wolves should not be scapegoats for the broader problems experienced by the EU farming industry, particularly the sheep and goat sectors, which face socio-economic challenges including, limited investment and geographical remoteness With the planet facing a biodiversity crisis, it is extremely disappointing to see MEPs regressing to promote the killing of a protected species and to downgrade its protection status rather than focusing on the constructive coexistence between large carnivores and the livestock farming industry. IFAW urges the European Commission to support biodiversity conservation and a future where wildlife and communities can coexist and thrive. Such a future can be achieved only if the EU maintains its strong commitment to promote coexistence and protect wild animals, including large carnivores.
