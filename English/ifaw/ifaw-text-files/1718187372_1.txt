The following is a contribution by our friend and partner Diana Barnes (DB), Chief Brand Officer at Munchkin, Inc. For 30 years, the purest of passions have fueled the design of all of our products. After all, at Munchkin we have the most vulnerable of customers to please: babies. We feel the same deep sentiment when it comes to our corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts around animal welfare, as this cause is just as dear to our hearts. We are so proud of our long-standing efforts with The Whale Sanctuary Project and now, our new partnership with IFAW. We share IFAW’s belief that every animal matters, and we are inspired by and supportive of the effective legislative and on-the-ground work IFAW does daily around the world. Together with these two partners, we are kicking off our third decade (our 30th birthday is next year!) with one of our most important initiatives – WildLove Cups – a collection that infuses our dedication to animal welfare with our #1 selling product, Miracle® 360° Cups. Each beautifully illustrated and, of course, brightly colored WildLove Cup showcases a different at-risk animal and their natural habitat. We created special packaging that is 100% recycled and recyclable. The packaging folds open to a pop out 3-panel illustration of the animal’s environment, becoming an irresistible playground for the cup. Within the packaging we’ve included a handwritten letter from the animal to the child sharing the story of its family and life, as well as a letter to parents explaining more about our efforts and what they can do to help. Becoming the most loved baby lifestyle brand in the world is indeed a lofty company mission and we take it seriously. At Munchkin, love extends far beyond the daily work done by our 353 employees; it means sharing it with those who need it the most. We believe that all animals are gifts to be loved, but we also understand that they are vital for the circle of life and that we have a responsibility to care for them and their homes. It is no surprise studies show that children who are raised to respect and take care of animals have a greater sense of responsibility and empathy[1],[2], but there is overwhelming data that shows caring for animals fosters emotional, cognitive, social, and physical development as well[3],[4]. IFAW show us how it is possible for animals and people to thrive together in our natural, intended environments. We can’t wait for you and your little ones to hold a WildLove Cup in your hands. Please help us spread this important message with your friends and family by showing you care, one cup at a time. #wildlovecups -Diana Barnes, Chief Brand Officer at Munchkin, Inc.
