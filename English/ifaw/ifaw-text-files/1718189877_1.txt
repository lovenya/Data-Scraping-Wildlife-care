Momentum for the future In many countries outside of Africa, ageing populations are facing high healthcare costs and a shortage of skilled labour. In Africa on the other hand, young people face underemployment and lack of opportunities or even access to information about opportunities. Yet young people are contributing daily to the benefit of their communities, and this inaugural APAC will provide them an opportunity to advocate for the change and impact the next generation is capable of. It is an inspiration to see many young people across Africa stepping forward to be part of the decision-making in Kigali. These young attendees are vital to the conversations ahead, and as IFAW we pledge our full support to work with them, to listen to them, and to implement the commitments that were made at this Youth Pre-Congress Workshop. We believe in true investment in youth development at all levels of conservation and animal and habitat protection. It is through platforms like these where we find influence and inspiration as we head back to our work on the ground. And we commend Africa and its leaders, as this workshop is further evidence to prioritization of the next generation in Africa. Each of these impressive change-makers can now seize the opportunity at hand and claim their seat at the table, as they will soon be our leaders and policy makers. As World Leaders of Today executive director Peter Moll closed the Workshop on behalf of the group, “We are youth champions, but we need champions for youth.” It is my honor and promise to support the next generation on its journey toward a world where animals and people thrive in this place we call home.
