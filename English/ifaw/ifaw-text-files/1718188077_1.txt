Additionally, in light of the recent guidance from healthcare professionals and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we have modified our rescue operations so that we continue to remain safe and in operation, ready to respond to stranded or injured wildlife. Our marine mammal rescue and research team is primarily working from home, yet scheduling shifts so that minimal staff are needed on-site and at the point of rescue. Our mission and dedication to IFAWâ€™s work will always continue. We will cautiously and thoughtfully stand ready to rescue injured or stranded wildlife, care for the animals currently at our project sites, and advocate that wildlife be kept in the wild with room to roam. As an organization, IFAW is doing its best to flatten the curve and to support our healthcare professionals as they work so tirelessly on the frontlines of this global crisis. They will forever have our thanks and admiration.
