wildlife struggle to survive in Kenya In drought-affected northern Kenya, home to the endangered Grevy’s zebra, IFAW-supported Grevy’s Zebra Trust helped to feed approximately 500 zebras daily between August and October by providing hay and supplements. IFAW also supplied clean drinking water to nearby communities. At the end of October, northern Kenya received some sporadic showers, but many areas remain dry. aid to communities in Somaliland In Somaliland, severe drought conditions have displaced hundreds of thousands of people and decimated crops and livestock. Last year, IFAW and Candlelight worked together with the communities in Ceeg, Warcibran, Fiqi-ayub, Haji-Salah and Duruqsi to provide water for the people and their animals, and fodder feed for livestock as part of a temporary relief plan. This year, the situation has undoubtedly worsened. Therefore, we recommenced our relief plan and delivered 40 barrels of water to 500 ‎households, which enabled both the drought-affected communities and their 555 livestock (core breeding sheep and goats) to get ‎access to safe and clean drinking water. We also provided emergency animal supplementary feed to 50 of the most ‎affected households in Odweine ‎and Burao districts to alleviate the suffering of the animals and secure the livelihoods of community members.
