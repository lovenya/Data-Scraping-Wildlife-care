To carry out these visits and guarantee the full understanding of our messages to the students, we join forces with a group of motivated local volunteers. These trained individuals share educational materials with the children that include a short documentary in Arabic and Amazigria, a fun presentation repeating key messaging, and giveaways to encourage an ongoing appreciation for wildlife in Morocco. The young children tend to imitate what they see and as they grow, they pass their learnings from one generation to the other. Changing the attitude of the generations to come is definitely a challenge underlying cultural aspects that are often difficult to address. Nevertheless, it is time to stand up and highlight that just because we have been doing something for many years, does not make it right. We need to encourage and welcome positive change to save more animals and people around the world. Born to be Wild is a project ensuring the sustainable protection of the endangered Barbary macaque. The project is initiated and funded by AAP Animal Advocacy and Protection and is executed together with IFAW, in close cooperation the Department of Water and Forests in the Kingdom of Morocco. -Kinda Jabi, Communications Officer, MENA
