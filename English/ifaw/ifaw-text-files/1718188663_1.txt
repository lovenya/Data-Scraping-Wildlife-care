January 6th, 2021 The rescue work continues in Croatia as local responders work tirelessly to feed, rescue animals and reunite families. Udruga Merida, an organization IFAW is supporting, reports the teams transported and distributed animal food to multiple affected communities, leaving extra supplies for local distribution to families who need to feed their beloved pets. Reunifications have also taken place and one small dog, named Loki, had the best outcome possible. Loki, scared and traumatized after the earthquake in Petrinja, ran out of his home and disappeared. His family could not find him and began working with local rescuers, including the team at Udruga Merida, to post his story. The community rallied and shared his photos widely. Happily, Loki was found and reunited with his family shortly thereafter. Other families are still searching for their furry loved ones, and our local counterparts will continue searching and reuniting families. January 5th, 2021 Thousands of people and countless animals were affected by powerful earthquakes that rocked Croatia on December 29-30th, 2020 – leaving many people and animals injured or dead. The earthquakes were felt as far away as Italy, and while human relief agencies help people in the aftermath of the devastation, IFAW rushes emergency aid to support veterinary care, food, emergency sheltering, and family reunification to our local counterparts who are rescuing animals at the epicenter of this disaster. Our Disaster Response and Risk Reduction team immediately reached out to local rescue contacts in Croatia. IFAW had previously responded in the region during the 2014 floods that impacted Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Stay tuned for more updates from this ongoing response.
