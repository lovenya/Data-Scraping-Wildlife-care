poaching has already declined 56 rangers to move in When complete, the camp will be home to 56 rangers and their families who will live and work there. Comfortable housing, equipped with electricity and running water, is being built for junior rangers and senior staff, and a recreation center is under construction. The operations center is already in use and set up with a landscape-wide VHF radio network—vital communications equipment that connects rangers and improves responses to incidents of poaching. a faster journey to Makona Before the camp was constructed, responses to poaching incidents and problem animals were slow, with rangers being deployed from Hwange Main Camp, some 95 kilometers away and enduring a terrible road snaking through the sticky Kalahari sands. Augustine Gomba, ZimParks’ Wildlife Officer based at Hwange Main Camp, says before the road was developed, driving to Makona was a nightmare. “The sandy soils and the rugged nature of the road meant that on average the trip to Makona would take a grueling four hours at least,” he says. A key achievement of the IFAW-ZimParks agreement was the improvement of the road, cutting a journey that could take up to four hours down to less than two. The park is nestled on the edge of the Kalahari Desert and is home to some of Africa’s most iconic species. Being largely flat and dominated by scattered woodlands of teak trees, it was an easy target for poachers. The new ranger station will prevent poachers from entering Hwange National Park into the future, allowing the park’s elephants and other wildlife to continue to flourish.
