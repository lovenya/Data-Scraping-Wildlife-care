brimming with biodiversity becoming a ranger after tragedy at the elephant nursery Annabelle was translocated from the Wild is Life elephant orphanage in Harare to Panda Masuie in 2018 after a successful rehabilitation. Ndlovu is one of only two female rangers among the 14 protecting Panda Masuie. “There is absolutely nothing that can stop women from taking up the responsibility” of serving as a ranger, she says. “It is all about dedication and sacrifice.” Francis Ncube, another ranger at the reserve, believes that Ndlovu’s story could inspire more women to help protect the country’s wildlife. “She is an amazing character,” he says. “She chose a very noble profession, and together we are here to safeguard our treasured wildlife resources.” “Busi is a fantastic asset to the team of people working at Panda Masuie. Both the elephants and the elephant handlers are very fond of her and feel confident around her, when she escorts them on their daily missions into the wild,” said Jos Danckwerts, Project Manager for the IFAW-supported Panda Masuie Release Project. IFAW Director of Landscape Conservation, Philip Kuvawoga, reaffirmed the organization’s long-term commitment to support ongoing work aimed at protecting wildlife and their habitats, saying: “It is IFAW’s commitment to ensure that the brave men and women tasked with the responsibility of protecting wildlife are well equipped and trained to secure our natural assets.”
