what happened? how is IFAW involved in this crisis? has IFAW deployed or sent any staff to Turkey or Syria? how can I help? how will my donation help animals in Turkey and Syria? where can I report injured animals I see online? where can people in Turkey or Syria report an animal displaced or injured by the earthquake? what's next? where can I follow updates from the ground in Turkey and Syria?
