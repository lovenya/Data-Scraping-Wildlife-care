Tiger man of India and the architect of the Ranthambhore National Park, Fateh Singh Rathore dedicated his entire life to the tigers of the park. His work in Ranthambhore, which included restoring and creating many of Ranthambhores lakes, laying a network of dirt roads to facilitate patrolling and village rehabilitation, have been pivotal in shaping Ranthambhore.

Between 1973 and the mid-1980s, under his watchful eyes, tiger numbers rose and Ranthambhore became a feather in Project Tigers cap. He was one of Ranthambhores fiercest protectors and continued to monitor developments there closely until his last breath. All those who knew him and loved him including thousands of kids around the country will miss Fateh kaka. Messages can be posted on this condolence page and will be passed on to Fateh Singh's family.
