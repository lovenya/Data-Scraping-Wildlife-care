It would help our survival and that of countless others if we keep in mind that humans are just one of the 8.7 million interdependent species on this vast and exquisite planet.

The human body itself hosts trillions of bacteria, some of which survive only if we do. We are complex beings that evolved from primitive organisms, as did wild animals and plants. Are they really that different from us, or do we share common grounds of emotions, behaviours and relationships that will help us co-exist? We bring you stunning images of some relatable moments in the wild.
