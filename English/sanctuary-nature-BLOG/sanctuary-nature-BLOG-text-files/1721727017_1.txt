Courageous, committed, honest and totally dedicated, he has in three  years been directly responsible for the recovery of Ranthambhore and its  tigers.When most senior conservationists had given up on the future of Ranthambhores tigers, G.V. Reddy came in and showed the way. He took on the poaching gangs, redoubled efforts to protect tiger ranges, stopped illegal grazing and inspired his team by leading from the front.
