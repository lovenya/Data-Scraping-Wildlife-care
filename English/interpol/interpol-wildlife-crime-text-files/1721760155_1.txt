Operations like Usalama show what can be achieved when law enforcement agencies work closely together in combating transnational crime,” said EAPCCO Chairman Joseph Boinnet, Inspector General of Kenya’s National Police Service.Supported by INTERPOL’s Regional Bureaus in Nairobi and Harare, a number of pre-operational meetings were held to share intelligence on national and regional crime issues and to provide training on INTERPOL’s capabilities used during the operation.“The positive outcome of Operation Usalama III is a true reflection of the importance of interregional and multilateral cooperation fighting organized and transnational crime,” said Julio Dos Santos Jane, SARPCCO Chairperson and General Commander of the Mozambique Police.“The results also show that it is vital to look beyond borders to both prevent crime and stop criminals escaping from justice,” added Mr Dos Santos Jane.Elizabeth Kuteesa, Director of INTERPOL’s Global Outreach and Regional Support unit said the operation underlined the added value of INTERPOL’s Regional Bureaus in strengthening national and regional law enforcement cooperation.“Operation Usalama III demonstrates what can be achieved through the commitment of countries and the expertise of frontline police backed by INTERPOL’s global capabilities,” said Ms Kuteesa.“This was a strong, coordinated response to tackle the serious crime challenges facing these regions, and INTERPOL will continue to provide its support as these arrests are followed up,” concluded Ms Kuteesa.SARPCCO member countries: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.EAPCCO member countries: Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.
