Match-fixing and other crimes in sport are a way for organized syndicates to generate high profits and launder their illegal proceeds, with limited risk of detection.Tackling these issues requires national and international cooperation between sport, public authorities, betting regulators, the gambling industry and law enforcement. We help bring all these stakeholders together to counter crimes in sport.

It focuses on investigative techniques typical of police work such as interview skills and information collection and evaluation, but also the monitoring and analysis of sports betting.Integrity in sport workshops and webinarsThese workshops bring together national and regional stakeholders including law enforcement agencies, prosecution services of some countries and sports organizations to raise awareness and identify best practices. Amongst key objectives, the INTERPOL- International Olympic Committee (IOC) workshops assess breaches of sport integrity, sports betting developments and global crime trends in competition manipulation.Central to these workshops is the promotion of capacity building and cooperation at all levels. They also provide a forum for knowledge exchange on tools and services to prevent, detect and investigate sports corruption.
