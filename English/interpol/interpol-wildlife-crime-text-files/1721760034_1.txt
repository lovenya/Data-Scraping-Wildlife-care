Fighting organized crime in MozambiqueSouthern African organized crime groups are typically involved in wildlife and forestry crime, particularly stock theft. They also engage in trafficking in drugs, firearms, people, stolen cars and counterfeit goods, especially pharmaceuticals. Cybercrime is also a growing regional concern.Most crime networks engage in all these crime areas simultaneously, using the same trafficking routes to move multiple forms of illegal produce across the region, often bringing violence, insecurity and economic loss with them.The international characteristics of these crimes and their links with organized crime groups around the world make the role of Mozambique’s INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) fundamental to maintaining national security.
