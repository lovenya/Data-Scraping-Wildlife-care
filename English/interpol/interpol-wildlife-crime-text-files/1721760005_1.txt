HARARE, Zimbabwe – The first I-ONE training course in Africa to enhance global security has been held, as part of INTERPOL’s efforts to boost the capacity of National Central Bureaus (NCB) on the continent.
 
The I-ONE project aims to strengthen the capacity of NCBs in 31 African countries through IT equipment renewal and training, paving the way for future I-24/7 extensions to borders for systematic and automatic traveler screening.
 
INTERPOL’s NCB in Harare was the first to benefit from the project, having received new IT equipment in December 2018.
 
This was followed by a four-day (19 - 22 February 2019) workshop providing 23 participants from NCB Harare with the knowledge and skills to make full use of INTERPOL’s global policing capabilities as well as raising awareness within national law enforcement agencies.
 
The event was inaugurated by Assistant Commissioner Tinei Nyazema, Deputy Director Administration of Zimbabwe’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID). In his opening remarks, he stressed the importance of personal and organizational learning. Chrispen Charumbira, Director CID and Commissioner of Police then recognized how the enhanced capacity to exploit INTERPOL’s databases contributes to strengthening security in Zimbabwe.
 
Discussions on the final day centered around I-24/7 extensions, gathering representatives from the Department of Immigration, Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), the President’s Office, Counter-narcotics department, Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe, Parks and Wildlife, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA), Registrar General, as well as telecom service providers.
