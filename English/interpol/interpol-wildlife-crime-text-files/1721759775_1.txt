Forensic data, such as fingerprints and DNA, is generally unique to an individual, and so can confirm a person’s identity and presence at a crime scene. Importantly, it can also help prove a suspect’s innocence. At the international level, forensic data can also be used to link a series of transnational crimes, and fingerprints can be quickly checked if a suspect is crossing a border. This data can also be used to help identify victims of major disasters. Facial recognition is a rapidly evolving biometric science which opens up many new opportunities for identifying individuals and solving crimes.At INTERPOL, we maintain criminal databases of fingerprints, DNA profiles and facial images, provided by our member countries. This allows police across the world to make connections between criminals and crime scenes. We also train frontline officers to assess, preserve and share evidence in line with best practices.
