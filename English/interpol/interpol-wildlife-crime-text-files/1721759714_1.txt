PartnersWe work with a number of partners, who are also involved in the fight against human trafficking and migrant smuggling, including:EuropolInternational Organization for MigrationFrontexOrganization for Security and Co-operation in EuropeOSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human RightsInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons (ICAT)United Nations Office on Drugs and CrimeProtecting victims, especially childrenOn the ground, we foster relationships with NGOs, government ministries and social services to ensure victims of trafficking and migrants receive appropriate treatment and care, and are protected throughout the identification and judicial processes.Minors are particularly vulnerable to trafficking, as they are more easily manipulated and often don’t realize they are the victims of crime. Some may feel they are being protected by their so-called employers, particularly if they are given meals and accommodation.INTERPOL recognizes the crucial role played by child protection units, social services and NGOs in our member countries. We regularly engage and involve them in our activities to ensure children are given the proper attention and care throughout investigations and operations.Private sectorPrivate sector partners play a key role in preventing, identifying and reporting suspected cases of human trafficking. In 2018, for example, Uber was the first private sector partner to join INTERPOL’s Human Trafficking Expert Group, followed by Western Union. We have also built strong working relationships with financial institutions, transportation, accommodation and online service providers.Global conferenceThe Global Conference on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling is an annual event, which brings together experts from law enforcement, the public and private sectors, non-governmental and international organizations to share and develop practices against the international groups behind smuggling and trafficking.7th Global Conference on Human Trafficking and Migrant SmugglingBuenos Aires, Argentina
