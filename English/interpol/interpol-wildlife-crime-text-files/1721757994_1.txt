SEOUL, Republic of Korea – On 12 February 2020, the Korean National Police University (KNPU) officially became a member of the INTERPOL Global Academy following a signing ceremony between Ms Lee Eun Jung, President of the Korean National Police University (KNPU), and Mr Jürgen Stock, INTERPOL Secretary General.Launched in 2019, the INTERPOL Global Academy is a network of trusted law enforcement education institutions of national or regional scope that facilitates the development of a global approach to law enforcement training through the exchange of best practices. As a member of the Global Academy, the KNPU will deliver specialized INTERPOL courses to law enforcement officials in Asia.Provided with cutting-edge curricula on a range of topics and with access to INTERPOL’s distance learning platform, the KNPU will contribute to the upskilling of officials across the region.  “We are very excited to welcome the KNPU on board and are confident that their participation will help expand the influence and reach of the INTERPOL Global Academy,” said Jorge Fainstein Day Gastrell, Acting Director of INTERPOL’s Capacity Building and Training Directorate. “The more officials we can train on INTERPOL policing capabilities and on specific transnational crime topics, the more we can strengthen global efforts to prevent and fight crime.”The KNPU is the second member to join the Global Academy after Colombia formally joined the network as a member for the Americas in 2019. Five more members are expected to join in 2020, covering other world regions.The first meeting of Global Academy members is scheduled to take place during the 22nd INTERPOL Police Training Symposium, which will be held at the National Police Academy of Spain in July. The previous Symposium was held at the KNPU in 2018.
