We aim to provide a diverse and respectful working environment that attracts, develops and retains talent.The General Secretariat employs 1000+ staff members from 132 different countries. Staff are based at the main building in Lyon (France), the Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore, or in one of our satellite offices.Approximately one-quarter of staff are police officers seconded by their national administrations; three-quarters are international civil servants hired under contract directly by the Organization.    
    
        
            
We accept applications from nationals of all our member countries to ensure that the Organization remains truly representative. Staff work in our four working languages (Arabic, English, French and Spanish) but a working knowledge of English is required for most posts.Our staff values are respect, integrity, excellence, teamwork and innovation. The actions and behaviour of all officials should be guided by these values in their daily activities.
