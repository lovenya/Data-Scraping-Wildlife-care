What you can doTake care when purchasing items and use all available means to determine their origin and provenance: this is particularly true for cultural objects that appear to originate from conflict zones;Use INTERPOL’s Stolen Works of Art Database to check every object you deal with. The database is open to the public and access can be requested.Compile inventories of collections, with photographs and exact descriptions of each object.Refuse to buy objects without adequate documentation about their origin;Make objects easily identifiable [i.e. marking by the owner or by specialist private companies];Protect the premises where collections are held;Report thefts immediately to the police or other law enforcement authorities and provide them with a full list of stolen items together with photographs.

UNESCO, UNIDROIT, UNODC, INTERPOL, WCO and CINOA call upon professionals and the public involved in the trade of cultural property to refrain from acquiring or taking part in the import, export or transfer of ownership of cultural property when they have reasonable cause to believe that the objects have been stolen, illegally alienated, clandestinely excavated or illegally exported from Afghanistan.”
