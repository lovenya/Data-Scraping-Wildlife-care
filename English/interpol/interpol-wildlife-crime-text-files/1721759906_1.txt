Pacific Island Chiefs of Police (PICP)SituationThe Pacific region is characterized by its relatively small island populations. While increased connectivity has brought with it potential economic benefits, vulnerabilities have also been exposed by criminal groups.The low risk of detection and the profitability arising from organized crime in this environment contribute to the region’s appeal as both a place of transit and destination. Since 2017, in recognition of regional and domestic security interests, five new Pacific Island countries have joined INTERPOL.
    
        
            
Project aimProject Blue Pacific will support the participating national police organizations to use INTERPOL resources in a sustainable way for increased information sharing. It will achieve this  through capacity building and training interventions. The project aims to establish a formal network in the region to further strengthen regional capabilities and harmonize coordination and cooperation.Project ActivitiesBlue Pacific will focus on three streams, aiming to achieve institutional change, and develop infrastructure to enhance the performance of law enforcement agencies.Stream 1 - TrainingKey to the project is the development of the professional skills of both participants and member country officers involved in the delivery of training.Participants will enhance their knowledge and skills related to the integration of human rights and gender mainstreaming standards into their law enforcement work.National law enforcement officers will learn how to manage the e-learning platforms and support course delivery.Stream 2 - INTERPOL Policing CapabilitiesThe project will promote and enhance the use of INTERPOL’s policing capabilities and expertise that can be offered to member countries. These capabilities are aligned to the delivery of INTERPOL’s core services to member countries (data, technology, infrastructure and legal framework).They also support our Global Policing Goals, are aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and will also be in line with the Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.Stream 3 - Regional CooperationThe Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police organization is an integral component for regional policing cooperation given its wide membership and support to the Pacific Transnational Crime Network (PCTN) which serves to facilitate information sharing and crime prevention among 28 countries.At the centre of the PTCN sits the Pacific Transnational Crime Coordination Centre established in Apia, Samoa aiming to facilitate greater information sharing between INTERPOL and its Pacific National Central Bureaus. Blue Pacific will identify the opportunities in enhancing the work of PTCN and bolster regional cooperation in crime monitoring and prevention as well as to reinforce the international cooperation with INTERPOL and its member countries.
