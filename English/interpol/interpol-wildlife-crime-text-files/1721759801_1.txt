Migrant smuggling networks can take advantage of people seeking a better life by facilitating their illegal entry into a country and further exploiting them.Several Western Balkan states are doubly impacted as they are both countries of origin and country of transit for migrants. Some of their residents seek to migrate, while people from other countries pass through the region with the aim of entering the European Union.Project aimsProject THB Balkans will strengthen the investigative capacity of law enforcement agencies in Balkan countries to counter human trafficking. This will be achieved by providing targeted training, investigative and operational support, and criminal analysis expertise.The ultimate aim is for law enforcement agencies to identify cases of human trafficking and dismantle the organized criminal groups responsible.Participants in the project will represent criminal and border police, national THB coordinators, specialized units, judges, prosecutors, INTERPOL National Central Bureaus (NCBs) and national police academies.Project activitiesAfter carrying out a needs assessment in each country, the following training programmes will be delivered online via the INTERPOL Virtual Academy:INTERPOL Policing Capabilities: This component equips participants with the necessary skills and knowledge for effective use of INTERPOL databases, applications, products and services.
