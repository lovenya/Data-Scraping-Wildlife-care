Tackling organized crime in LesothoSouthern African organized crime syndicates are typically involved in a wide range of crimes including wildlife and forestry crime, particularly stock theft. They are also known to smuggle motor vehicles, firearms and people across the region’s borders, and to engage in large-scale cybercrime. For many years, Lesotho was used as a transit country for the smuggling and trafficking of people into neighboring countries.Most crime networks engage in these crime areas simultaneously, using the same trafficking routes to move multiple forms of illegal produce across the region, often bringing violence, insecurity and economic loss.            
    
        
            
To anticipate, monitor, prevent and investigate these threats, and because crime networks invariably operate globally, it is essential for Lesotho’s law enforcement to have access to a global police cooperation tool enabling it to work with counterparts in all continents.INTERPOL in Lesotho
