Under the five-year partnership, Morpho’s cutting-edge facial recognition technology will also be provided to INTERPOL as an additional criminal identification tool.The two organizations, along with other key partners, will also collaborate on developing global standards and best practices to improve border efficiency and security through the use of biometrics in order to tackle the challenge of increasing numbers of travellers and the related threats.INTERPOL Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said the constant and fast-moving evolution in biometric technology meant that private sector expertise and support through partnerships such as with Morpho were essential.“As criminals employ ever more sophisticated ways to avoid detection, so too must law enforcement benefit from the latest advances in technology, especially in biometrics, to more effectively combat all forms of transnational crime,” said Mr Noble.“This is particularly true at borders, when officials have just moments to decide whether to allow a person into their country or not. It is vital that they have all the necessary tools at their fingertips to enable them to check whether this person is wanted internationally or has tried to conceal their identity,” he added.“INTERPOL’s partnership with Morpho brings together these essential elements to help our member countries better protect their borders and their citizens, and to bring fugitive criminals to justice,” concluded the INTERPOL Chief.Philippe Petitcolin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Morpho, commented, “This new partnership is a continuation of our decade-long effort to support INTERPOL in its fight against transborder crime through delivery of advanced biometric solutions.”“With our technological leadership and experience in the field, we are well positioned to provide INTERPOL and its member states with valuable input on the subject of border security,” added Mr Petitcolin.Since 1999, Morpho has provided INTERPOL with its Automated Fingerprint Biometric System (AFIS) enabling officers in all member countries to conduct checks and identify internationally wanted persons via INTERPOL’s global network. Under the partnership, this system will be replaced with Morpho’s latest-generation AFIS which includes enhanced capabilities and offers even greater speed.
