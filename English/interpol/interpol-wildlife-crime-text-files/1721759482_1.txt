Tackling Paraguayan crimeA landlocked country sitting geographically between drug consumer and producer regions, Paraguay can attract transnational criminal organizations wishing to carry out smuggling operations into the region, or to cross it on their way to other countries and continents.In addition, Paraguay’s extensive river system, particularly the Paraguay River which runs North to South across the centre of the country, facilitates the inconspicuous transportation of illegal merchandise. Associated crime includes money laundering and people trafficking.The international characteristics of these crime types and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Asuncion fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.INTERPOL in ParaguayThe INTERPOL NCB in Asuncion is part of the Policía Nacional del Paraguay (PNP) which is the national police force.
