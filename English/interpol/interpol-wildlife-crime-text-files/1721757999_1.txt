LYON, France – One of Israel’s most wanted fugitives has been arrested in Mexico and sent back to serve out his 18-year sentence for attempted murder and forgery.
 
Convicted of the 1998 attempted murder of a father and son, Erez Akrishevski escaped during 48-hour prison leave in 2001. He fled the country, prompting the Israel National Police (INP) to publish an INTERPOL Red Notice, or internationally wanted persons alert.        
    
        
            
Akrishevski was caught in Argentina in 2004, but fled while on bail. He is believed to have travelled throughout the Americas over the next decade, often to Mexico, and was allegedly connected to criminal activity and Israeli organized crime figures.
 
In February, international coordination was enhanced when INTERPOL’s Fugitive Investigative Support unit focused on the Red Notice. The unit facilitated communication between Israeli, Mexican and US authorities, including a high-level meeting between the National Central Bureaus for Israel and Mexico. This coordination work enabled the US Marshals Service for International Investigations to identify crime patterns, known contacts and the fugitive’s location.
 
Akrishevski was ultimately arrested in Mexico, by special authorities.
 
The 57-year-old has now been deported to Israel, where he will serve the remainder of his sentence. This outcome shows the clear benefits of international coordination, with the INP acknowledging the essential role played by INTERPOL both in terms of policing capabilities and investigative support.
