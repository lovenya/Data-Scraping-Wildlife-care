They go through the images with a fine-toothed comb with the objective of removing the child from harm and arresting the abuser.Evidence of a serious crimeContrary to common beliefs about sexual abuse, the abuser is most often a person known to the child, such as a family member, neighbour or childcare professional. The vast majority of child sexual abuse cases are not documented, mostly taking place behind closed doors in private settings.When the abuse is recorded or photographed, however, what is really being documented is evidence of a serious crime. Abusers often use the images for future sexual gratification, or to be traded and shared with other abusers.    
    
        Photos and videos of child sexual abuse found on the web are not virtual; they are evidence of a real crime involving real children and real suffering.
