INTERPOL Notices are international requests for cooperation or alerts allowing police in member countries to share critical crime-related information.Notices are issued by the General Secretariat at the request of a member country’s INTERPOL National Central Bureau and are made available for all our member countries to consult in our Notices database.Notices can also be issued at the request of International Criminal Tribunals and the International Criminal Court to seek persons wanted for committing crimes within their jurisdiction, notably genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. They can also be issued at the request of the United Nations in relation to the implementation of sanctions imposed by the Security Council.Most Notices are for police use only and are not available to the public. However, an extract of the Notice can be published on this site if the requesting country wishes to alert the public or seek their help. All United Nations Special Notices are public.

Notices must meet legal criteriaA Notice is published only if it complies with INTERPOL’s Constitution and fulfils all conditions for processing the information in accordance with our Rules on the Processing of Data. This ensures the legality and quality of information, and the protection of personal data.For example, a Notice will not be published if it violates Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution, which forbids the Organization from undertaking any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character.Requests for notices are reviewed for compliance with INTERPOL’s rules by our Notices and Diffusions Task Force; this is a specialized multilingual and multidisciplinary task force comprising lawyers, police officers and operational specialists.DiffusionsMember countries may also request cooperation from each other through another mechanism known as a 'diffusion'. Diffusions are circulated directly by a member country’s National Central Bureau to all or some other member countries.  Diffusions correspond to the Notices colour-coded system, so there are red, yellow, blue, black, green, purple and orange diffusions, and they must comply with INTERPOL’s Constitution and the Rules on the Processing of Data.Wanted persons (red) diffusions –  those circulated to arrest, detain, or restrict the movement of a convicted or accused person – are checked for compliance by the Notices and Diffusions Task Force.A diffusion will not be entered into in INTERPOL’s database if it is of political, military, religious or racial character in violation of Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution.
