Common vision – Shared responsibility“The Dialogue is an opportunity to continue building on our common vision and shared responsibility to ensure that the global policing architecture is ready to contribute to sustainable development around the world,” said INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock.“Our strategic vision should therefore be long-term and multilayered, informed by global and regional threats affecting wider economic and social issues.“Without a concerted, coordinated effort, there is a profound risk that gaps could occur, or that we unnecessarily duplicate efforts at a time when police forces face unprecedented challenges,’ concluded Secretary General Stock.Global Policing GoalsThe Dialogue will also contribute to the review process of INTERPOL’s Global Policing Goals (GPGs) and their nexus to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The aim is to also reflect the strategic priorities and perspectives of all regional policing organizations in order to identify opportunities for collective action in combating identified threats.The review of the INTERPOL GPGs will be conducted as the United Nations reviews the implement of their SDGs.An INTERPOL initiative to create a platform of liaison officers from all regional policing organizations at the General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon, France was also welcomed by Dialogue members.Participating Dialogue entities: The Arab Interior Ministers' Council (AIMC), the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL), the Police Community of the Americas (AMERIPOL), the Caribbean Community Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), the Gulf Cooperation Council-POL (GCCPOL), the Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO-RATS) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
