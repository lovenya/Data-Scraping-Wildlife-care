Fighting organized crime in Solomon IslandsThe isolated nature of the Pacific Islands' coastlines, their sparse population and geographic positioning between the Americas and Asia makes the region attractive to organized crime. The Solomon Islands comprises six main islands and 900 smaller islands.The four major types of transnational crimes affecting the Solomon Islands are environmental crime and trafficking in drugs, people and stolen firearms.The country’s rich land and maritime biodiversity has created a market for wildlife traffickers who use the vast high sea transit zones to smuggle protected flora and fauna to markets all over the world. Fisheries crime, wildlife trafficking, illegal logging and illegal gold exports are high priority crime areas for the Solomon Islands.            
    
        
            
The international characteristics of these crimes and their links with crime networks around the world mean the role of INTERPOL’s National Central Bureau (NCB) in Honiara is crucial to preserving national security and keeping the region safe.INTERPOL in Solomon IslandsThe Solomon Islands NCB plays a central role in preventing the country and surrounding region from serving international organized crime.
