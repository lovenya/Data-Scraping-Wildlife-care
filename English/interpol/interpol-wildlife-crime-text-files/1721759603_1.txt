Tackling Colombian crimeColombia is located at a crossroads between North and South America, the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. This geographic layout coupled with Colombia’s flourishing economy has made it increasingly attractive to organized crime.Drugs, people trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering and environmental crime are among the crimes perpetrated by organized networks either in or against Colombia.Since crime groups operate on a global level, Colombian law enforcement agencies need to be able to work with counterparts in all continents. The role of INTERPOL’s National Central Bureau (NCB) in Bogota is therefore crucial to maintaining regional security.
