The INTERPOL Support Programme for the African Union in relation to AFRIPOL (ISPA) assists AFRIPOL in developing its functions across the continent. The programme started in 2020 for an initial period of three years until March 2023 (Phase 1) and was extended until December 2026  (Phase 2). Longstanding cooperation between INTERPOL and the African UnionINTERPOL and the African Union work side by side on matters of joint interest, sharing resources and expertise, and developing combined responses to Africa’s policing needs. This ongoing cooperation was formalized with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the AU and INTERPOL in 2011.A further cooperation agreement signed with the AU in 2019 identifies complementarity between INTERPOL and AFRIPOL, avoiding duplication of efforts amongst common member countries and promoting synergies.Programme aimsThe ISPA Programme supports AFRIPOL to strengthen its position as the lead institution in Africa for preventing and combating transnational organized crime, terrorism, cybercrime and financial crime.Specifically, the programme promotes the development of AFRIPOL’s capabilities through operations and investigations, criminal analysis and the exchange of information, knowledge, and best practices.These activities help AFRIPOL to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of police across Africa by assessing crime threats, harmonizing police methods, and fostering good governance, in line with national policies.Programme activities
