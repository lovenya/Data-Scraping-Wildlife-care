Fighting organized crime in Czech RepublicThe Czech Republic is a landlocked country located in Central Europe which shares borders with four other European Union countries. Its advanced high-income economy and strategic geographical location are attractive to regional organized crime groups wishing to carry out large-scale trafficking operations, particularly in relation to drugs and people smuggling.Consequently, the Czech Republicâ€™s priority crime areas include economic crime, illegal migration, cybercrime related offences, trafficking in drugs and intellectual property crime.The international dimensions of these crime areas and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in the Czech Republic crucial in tackling international crime and contributing to national and regional security.INTERPOL in Czech RepublicThe NCB in Prague is part of the national police structure.
