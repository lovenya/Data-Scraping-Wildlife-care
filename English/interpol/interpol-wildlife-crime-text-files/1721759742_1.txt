Global Counter-Terrorism Initiative INTERPOL developed a five-year Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy to maximize the use of its policing capabilities. This project aimed to establish the necessary infrastructure to help INTERPOL member countries effectively tackle transnational terrorist activities.2. Project against Illicit Drug Trafficking INTERPOL developed Project AMEAP (Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific) in order to help national authorities to identify security threats and confront organized crime groups involved in illicit drug trafficking in these regions through the adoption of a cross-border, operational approach with INTERPOL leading the coordination.3. Cybercrime Information Sharing and Real-Time Analytics Platform INTERPOL’s Strategy to Combat Cybercrime addresses “pure cybercrime”, in other words, crimes which target computer and information systems. The overarching goal of the project was to create a technology platform to improve INTERPOL’s capacity to obtain, analyse, and disseminate actionable cyber intelligence.4. Combating Migrant Smuggling, Human Trafficking, and Online Child Sexual Exploitation INTERPOL’s project to protect vulnerable communities was aimed at identifying and disrupting criminal networks engaged in migrant smuggling, human trafficking, and online child sexual exploitation, taking into consideration the initiatives of other regional bodies in these areas to coordinate and harmonize their respective efforts.5. Protecting Cultural Heritage To further bolster the Organization’s efforts to protect cultural heritage, INTERPOL has greatly improved the functionalities of the Stolen Works of Art (WOA) Database by making it accessible via the very first INTERPOL mobile application which is freely accessible not only to police forces, but also to authorized public and private entities. The project also delivered training courses for INTERPOL NCBs, customs officials, and other users on proper data entry, conducting data searches, and generating and retrieving statistics.6. Reducing Vehicle Crime INTERPOL’s Stolen Motor Vehicles (SMV) project aimed to establish INTERPOL as a leading authority and resource in the fight against transnational vehicle crime, working closely with existing partners, international organizations, and insurance associations to improve the expertise that it provides to member countries.7. Preventing Trafficking in Illicit Goods and Medical Products The goal of INTERPOL’s Illicit Markets Project was to provide support to member countries to dismantle the organized crime networks behind the manufacture, distribution, and sale of illegal goods, including specific activities with a regional and global focus.
