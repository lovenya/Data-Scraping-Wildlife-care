As a result, its priority crime areas of concern include trafficking in drugs, firearms, people and fake goods, as well as cybercrime.The international characteristics of these crimes and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Oman fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.INTERPOL in OmanStaffed by 15 men and women, NCB Oman is part of the Criminal Intelligence Department at the Muscat Police headquarters.
