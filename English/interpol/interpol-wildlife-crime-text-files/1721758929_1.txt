These call for countries to take appropriate steps to prevent the trade in stolen cultural property, and specifically the use of INTERPOL’s global policing capabilities, such as its Stolen Works of Art database.In this respect, experts from Iraq, Syria and Yemen provided updates on cultural heritage crimes in their respective countries.With police operations both at the regional and global level a fundamental way to tackle crimes related to cultural property, INTERPOL leads and organizes major law enforcement operations – such as the Pandora and joint police-customs Athena operations. It also provides the only international police database containing information on stolen works of art.Corrado Catesi, Coordinator of INTERPOL’s Works of Art unit, explained that no country was immune to cultural theft and trade: “Our collective focus must be to protect heritage from exploitation and destruction. Establishing specialized police units with an operational stolen works of art database should be at the heart of an effective national strategy.”
