The issuesThe use of firearms by criminals endangers the safety of citizens in all countries of the world. As well as their obvious use in armed robberies and murder, they are also linked to a wide range of other crimes. These include corruption, environmental crime, human trafficking, maritime piracy, organized crime and terrorist activities.Small arms and light weapons are easy for criminals to conceal and transport, so trafficking in firearms is a lucrative business which, in turn, fuels and funds other types of serious crimes.
