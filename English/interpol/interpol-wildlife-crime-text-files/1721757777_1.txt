Sakil Husen, aged 42, was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice, or internationally wanted person alert, issued at the request of Nepal in June 2015 for rape and multiple murder.The fugitive allegedly killed his 18-year old wife and in-laws during a family property dispute in 2015. He is also believed to have killed four other people later the same year in the context of financial disagreements.Police cooperation beyond bordersWith the Nepalese authorities issuing a national arrest warrant against him, Sakil Husen fled Nepal, prompting the publication of an INTERPOL Red Notice inviting 192 member countries to help Nepal locate the fugitive and facilitate his arrest.Close collaboration between the INTERPOL National Central Bureaus in Qatar and Nepal permitted Doha police authorities to locate the fugitive working as a laborer in the local building industry.Qatari police authorities arrested Sakil Husen 7 February in Qatar and deported him 4 March to Nepal where he awaits trial at Saptari and Sunsari District Courts. If convicted, the fugitive faces life imprisonment and the confiscation of his property.A powerful global tracking tool“By requesting an INTERPOL Red Notice, my country activated a robust global police ‘tripwire’ for one of its most wanted serial killers,” said Mr. Prakash Aryal, Inspector General of Police, Head of NCB Kathmandu.“The INTERPOL Red Notice enabled Nepal to make police forces in 192 member countries aware of the danger posed by this roving fugitive and take measures to prevent him from endangering citizens of their own countries,” said the Inspector General.“As soon as we received the Red Notice for the fugitive, with INTERPOL Nepal we conducted a series of operations which led to the criminal’s arrest. He was then extradited and escorted by Qatari law enforcement to Nepalese authorities in Kathmandu,” said Mohammed Al-Hajri, Head of NCB Doha. “INTERPOL Doha always strives to support and enhance cooperative relationships with all INTERPOL member states,” added the Head of NCB Doha, highlighting the direct role in crime prevention and criminal arrests that INTERPOL notices, particularly the Red Notice, provide.World’s largest police organizationContaining identification details and judicial information about a wanted person, INTERPOL Red Notices communicate to police worldwide that a person is wanted by a member country and request that the suspect be placed under provisional arrest pending extradition.With INTERPOL’s global databases - which include Red Notice data - now queried almost 200 times every second across the globe, these have become amongst the key capabilities the Organization provides its member countries to prevent and investigate crime.Circulated to 192 INTERPOL member countries, the Red Notice represents one of INTERPOL’s most powerful tools in tracking international fugitives.
