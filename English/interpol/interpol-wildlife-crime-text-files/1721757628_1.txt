Talks between the two leaders, and other senior government and policing officials, were aimed at identifying key areas where additional INTERPOL support could assist national authorities in combating terrorism and its financing, as well as organized crime such as drug trafficking.These include expanding access to INTERPOL’s global network and policing databases which contain nearly 100 million records, comprising details of more than 50,000 foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs).

INTERPOL’s Project FIRST (Facial, Imaging, Recognition, Searching and Tracking), which helps countries to enhance security through biometric data sharing on FTFs and other terrorist suspects was also highlighted as a potential area for cooperation.In addition, under Project Watchmaker, INTERPOL currently holds details of more than 3,200 individuals linked to Improvised Explosive Device (IED) activities. These include latent prints taken from IEDs, identification of those believed to have held leadership roles in attack coordination, and the procurement of IED materials.A third area where potential support could be provided is in countering illicit drug flows and related financial crimes through regional coordination with other INTERPOL member countries.“Afghanistan continues to face a range of security threats, including from more than 20 active terrorist networks,” said Secretary General Stock.

“My discussions with President Ghani and other senior officials have focused on identifying areas where INTERPOL can bring its global network and expertise to where they are needed most.“As the global law enforcement organization, INTERPOL has a responsibility to ensure that we are doing everything we can to support each of our 194 member countries and their citizens,” concluded the INTERPOL chief.During his mission to Afghanistan, his first official visit to the country, Secretary General Stock held a number of meetings, including with Hamdullah Mohib, National Security Advisor, Mohammed Massoud Andarabi, Minister of Interior and Mohammed Masoom Stanekzai, Director of the National Directorate of Security.Afghanistan has been a member of INTERPOL since 2002, with its National Central Bureau in Kabul under the authority of the Ministry of Interior. It supports police at key air and land borders by giving them access to information contained in INTERPOL’s criminal databases.
