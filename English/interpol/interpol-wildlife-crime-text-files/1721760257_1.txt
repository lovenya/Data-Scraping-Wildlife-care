Our Environmental Security Unit brings together member countries, international organizations, civil society organizations and the private sector.We have four global enforcement teams (Fisheries, Forestry, Pollution and Wildlife) which help dismantle the criminal networks behind environmental crime by providing law enforcement agencies with the tools and expertise they need to protect the environment from being exploited by criminals.They offer investigative support to international cases and targets, coordinate operations, assist member countries to share information and conduct analysis into environmental criminal networks.            
    
        
            
From Thailand to Kenya, France to Argentina, we have a presence in INTERPOL offices around the world to target hot spots, address regional needs and provide adequate analytical and investigative support.A Strategy Team supports these four teams to function in an interdependent world where international policy and partnerships are essential to achieve excellence in and keep an innovative approach to law enforcement.Our Environmental Compliance Enforcement Committee comprises executive level officials and decision makers from member countries. It assists us in identifying and setting priorities, and responding to emerging trends in environmental crime. It is also a forum for law enforcement officials to share experience and expertise, and discuss new strategies.
    
        
            
National Task ForcesA National Environmental Security Task Force (NEST) brings together police, customs, environmental agencies, prosecutors, non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental partners to focus environmental crime fighting efforts on the networks and crimes that particularly affect a country.NESTs allow law enforcement to stand alongside scientific experts whose knowledge and access to resources are invaluable in the fight against environmental criminals. A NEST draws on the mandates of each agency involved to combat environmental crimes from all angles â€“ from on-the-ground illegal poaching to investigations into the financial and tax affairs of criminal networks.Case meetingsRegional Investigative and Analytical Case Meetings allow investigators from different countries to meet face-to-face to review cases and share intelligence and analysis, helping them solve cases faster. They are arranged at the request of member countries, and our officers can provide expert assistance where needed.Investigative Support TeamsWe deploy teams of specialized law enforcement officers to support national authorities in their investigations. Our experts can assist with many aspects of an investigation, including digital forensics, guidance for undercover operations, and language and technical support in interviewing suspects.Training            
    
        
            
We conduct extensive training and capacity building activities for our member countries to improve their effectiveness in fighting environmental crime. Regional and national level training events across Africa and Asia have led to more successful environmental crime operations.NoticesINTERPOL notices can be used to alert member countries and share information on environmental crimes. We use Red Notices to find wanted environmental criminals, Blue Notices to collect information on suspects, Purple Notices for information on modus operandi, and Green Notices to provide warnings and intelligence about environmental criminals likely to repeat their crimes in other countries.Analytical SupportOur analysts can study data related to environmental criminals, suspects, incidents, issues and trends. We identify connections between different crimes in different places, with the analysis then used to drive investigations, operations and strategy, and influence international policy.ICCWCThe International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) is a powerful alliance to fight wildlife crime effectively. It delivers determined and coordinated support to law enforcement, helping to deliver action on the ground and bring criminals to justice.
