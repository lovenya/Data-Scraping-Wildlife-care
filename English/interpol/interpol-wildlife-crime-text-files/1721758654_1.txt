The INTERPOL handbook on DNA data exchange and practice, available also on INTERPOL's web site, has met with success in the law enforcement world. The International DNA Users' Conference for Investigative Officers, opening on Wednesday (7 Nov.) at INTERPOL's Headquarters in Lyon, France, will be told of a record high number of web hits for down loading the handbook alone.Over the recent years, DNA profiling has become a cutting-edge crime investigation technique. With its capability to implicate or eliminate, DNA profiling offers investigators a powerful new tool as they seek to unravel criminal cases. DNA profiling is therefore a vital addition to the techniques traditionally available to investigators. Linked criminal strategies can be analysed and new criminal phenomena recognised, resulting in more effective police management and corresponding savings in human, material and financial resources.'DNA profiling is one of the most efficient techniques for identifying individuals suspected of crime. It is perhaps one of the most significant developments in the ability of the police to detect crime from evidence left at the scene, and a crucial weapon in combating those crimes of a violent or sexual nature', says INTERPOL's chief Ronald K. Noble.The INTERPOL DNA Handbook was produced by the DNA unit at INTERPOL's headquarters and the organisation's DNA advisory expert group. It is primarily directed at law enforcement officers with the aim of giving them a clearer understanding of DNA techniques and practices. The handbook is currently being translated into French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and German.'I would recommend this handbook to all law enforcement officers dealing with DNA matters', says Secretary General Noble.
