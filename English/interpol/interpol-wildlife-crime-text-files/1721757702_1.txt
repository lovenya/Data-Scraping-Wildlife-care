Fugitives are criminals on the run, and as such pose a serious threat to public safety worldwide. They are mobile (often travelling between countries on stolen or fraudulent travel documents), and opportunistic, frequently financing their continued flight from the law through further criminal activities.Sharing information about fugitives and bringing them back to face justice in the country where they committed the crime has been a core function of INTERPOL since our creation. It is even more important today in world where travel is so easy and crimes cross borders so fluidly.
    
        “The world only gets smaller; for fugitives there are no borders, and close international police cooperation has never been more crucial.”
            
We support member countries and other international entities to locate and arrest fugitives who cross international boundaries. We provide investigative support, deliver training, bring experts together and encourage sharing of best practice.We also provide operational support and assistance to the searches for individuals wanted for ﻿serious international crimes (genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes) by INTERPOL member countries, UN tribunals and the International Criminal Court.Red Notice – wanted personsOne of the main tools for tracking fugitives is the INTERPOL Red Notice, which is an alert to all countries to request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition.We also offer a number of border management tools, used in combination with Notices, to help detect fugitives attempting to cross borders. Key resources are our SLTD database (travel and identity documents) and our forensic expertise.
    
        Every day, on average, nine INTERPOL Red Notices are cancelled because of the arrest, extradition or surrender of the fugitives in question.
