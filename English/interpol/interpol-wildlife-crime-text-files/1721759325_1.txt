Tackling organized crime in the AmericasOrganized crime groups in the Americas engage in many crime areas, such as money laundering and trafficking in drugs, people or firearms. This brings violence, insecurity and economic loss to the region, enhanced by their connections with other crime networks across the world.INTERPOL National Central Bureaus (NCBs) in the Americas have access to our unique range of policing tools, expertise, and global network. This enables them to provide a global viewpoint on the crime issues in the region, and help their national agencies protect their people, economies and national security.
