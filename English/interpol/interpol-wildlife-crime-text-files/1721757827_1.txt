LYON, France – A new police tool has been launched by INTERPOL and the G8, enabling the INTERPOL community to exchange information on fraudulent identity and travel documents.

Known as Dial-Doc (Digital INTERPOL Alert Library – Document), the technology makes it easy for officials in any of INTERPOL’s 190 member countries to check if a travel document is fake, through comparison with worldwide images of counterfeit documents.
 
Dial-Doc will play a central role in the swift provision of information to law enforcement agencies, particularly in the fields of border management and the fight against identity fraud, human trafficking, terrorism, and financial crime. It is an integral part of INTERPOL’s strategy to provide integrated solutions for border security and to offer access to an array of systems and data that help officers to prevent and combat transnational crime.
 
“This important reference tool for travel document fraud is the culmination of intensive and fruitful cooperation leveraging the combined expertise of INTERPOL and migration experts from the G8 countries,” said Lynn Lawless, Director, Enforcement and Intelligence Programs Management, Canada Border Services Agency, and representing the G8 Roma-Lyon Migration Experts Sub-Group.“Dial-Doc will assist in the global fight against document and identity fraud and the criminal activity it facilitates,” she added.Up until now, INTERPOL member countries have circulated their own ‘alerts’ relating to fraudulent travel documents. Dial Doc is the data processing platform which regulates this information and makes it accessible to all INTERPOL member countries in a user-friendly manner.Once the country submits their ‘alert’ to INTERPOL, a quality control activity is performed before final validation and its publication within the INTERPOL Information System.
 
Fabrizio Di Carlo, Dial-Doc Project Manager, said: “The launch of Dial-Doc represents a milestone in the fight against forged documents. We now encourage as many countries as possible to share data related to fraudulent travel documents in order to fulfil the potential of this vital law enforcement tool.”Dial-Doc is a web-based application, available to authorized users via I-24/7, the Organization’s secure global police communications system and its restricted-access website. Currently in English, the platform will in future be translated into INTERPOL’s three other official languages (Arabic, French and Spanish).
