SINGAPORE - INTERPOL has held the first course to train wildlife crime investigators on how to extract and analyse data from seized electronic devices.With increasing amounts of digital evidence recovered during wildlife crime investigations, the training also equipped participants with the skills to identify and securely handle devices which could potentially contain data of interest for a criminal investigation.The three-day (28 – 30 June) course run by INTERPOL’s Environmental Security Programme in collaboration with the Digital Forensics Lab at the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation brought together 20 specialist officers from 10 countries across Asia.In recent months, INTERPOL has already provided assistance to several countries in extracting and analysing data from phones seized as part of national investigations into wildlife trafficking.The training is part of INTERPOL’s ongoing commitment to ensure law enforcement officers have the knowledge and skills to keep up with the criminal use of digital tools in the illegal trafficking of wildlife, including via online platforms and on the Darknet.The following countries were represented on the course which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
