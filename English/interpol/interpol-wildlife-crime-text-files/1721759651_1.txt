What is the Dialogue?The Dialogue is a unique process that gathers all the world’s regional policing organizations and other major intergovernmental security stakeholders under INTERPOL’s global umbrella, to maintain regular high-level discussions about coordinating our efforts against global threats.This high-level process was established in 2016 out of INTERPOL’s strong belief in the importance of adopting a comprehensive and coordinated global approach when addressing cross-continental security threats.It strives to improve mutual cooperation, enhance exchange of information and best practices, and minimize duplication between key international and regional law enforcement stakeholders.Who participates?The Dialogue includes high-level delegates from the following organizations: AFRIPOL, AMERIPOL, ASEANAPOL, the Arab Interior Ministers Council, the Economic Cooperation Organization, EUROPOL, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency – Frontex, and the Gulf Cooperation Council-POL, as well as INTERPOL. There are two observer organizations: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization and UNODC.Why is the Dialogue needed?Our collective success in tackling global crime threats depends on aligning our strategies, and coordinating our operational efforts together with all regional policing and border management organizations. This ensures complementarity and avoids duplication of efforts or missed opportunities.It is important to remove obstacles to information sharing between the organizations, and to ensure that this information is accessible to police and customs officers at the border frontlines, in order to be able to intercept successfully the movement of terrorists and criminals.
