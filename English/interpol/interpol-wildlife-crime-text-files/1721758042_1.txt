This means our member countries will be better able to:Prevent terrorismSecure their bordersProtect their citizens, especially vulnerable communitiesMake cyberspace safer for businesses and infrastructureCounter corruptionDismantle trafficking networksSupport environmental security.These new services will make a tangible difference in crisis management situations, such as responding to the policing challenges associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact will be particularly positive in countries that lack the required services and cannot develop them on their own.Initiatives to change the face of international policingWith 12 projects in total, the first phase of the Programme (2020-2022) will focus on three initiatives to  improve:access to biometric data for frontline policeinternational case message exchangesearch and exploitation of informationA joint ventureThrough technological transformation and proactive policing, I-CORE will help provide the level of safety and stability necessary for economic, social and environmental development.
