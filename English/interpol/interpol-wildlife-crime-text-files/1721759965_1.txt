Mentoring programmeAs part of our activities to extend the reach of the IIPCIC platform, we have established regional Mentoring Programmes in order to bring officers together in person in a train-the-trainer framework.Participants then take their newfound knowledge and skills back to their national administrations where they not only cascade this practical information to colleagues, but can also use the information to help influence strategic thinking and allocation of resources.Embedding IP training into national police curriculumsOne of the most effective ways to draw attention to IP crime and boost a country’s response is to build the IIPCIC training into police college curriculums. In order for this to happen, backing is necessary at government level.The Police Chiefs Cooperation Organizations for Southern Africa and East Africa (SARPCCO and EAPCCO) have adopted this approach in their respective regions.Project Health  Training courses run under Project Health build the capacity of law enforcement agencies to fight pharmaceutical crime and public health infringements. Courses are conducted in the Americas, Africa and Asia.
