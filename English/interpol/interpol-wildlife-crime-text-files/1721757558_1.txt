NEW DELHI, India – INTERPOL’s 90th General Assembly has voted to further prioritize diversity and inclusion in order to ensure the INTERPOL General Secretariat truly reflects its global membership of 195 countries.The General Secretariat counts approximately 1,000 staff members from 115 countries. Though many workplaces would consider this to be an already rich staff base, in real terms it means that one third of INTERPOL’s membership is currently not represented.The Resolution will see the Organization implement a series of measures to proactively seek candidates from under and unrepresented countries. Having identified diversity as a priority, INTERPOL’s Executive Committee supported the push to seek out and encourage wider representation at all levels of the Organization.General Secretariat staffINTERPOL staff are composed of police officers seconded by their national administrations and international civil servants hired under contract directly by the Organization. They are based at the headquarters building in Lyon, France, the Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore, in Regional Bureaus and Special Representative offices around the world.Serving police officers are a crucial part of INTERPOL’s operational success. As well as bringing their specialized policing experience and skills to INTERPOL, they benefit from a greater understanding of international police cooperation to take back home at the end of their secondment.
    
One country at a timeSeeking out more high-quality, high potential candidates from around the world will multiply the skillsets and experience in all duty stations to better serve the global law enforcement community.Just this week, the Maldives Police Service (MPS) announced that for the first time, they would be seconding an officer to INTERPOL.“This secondment demonstrates the Maldives’ commitment to enhancing global efforts to fight crime. Not only are we proud to contribute to the international arena, this paves the way for the MPS to further develop its capacities and capabilities,” said Mohammed Hameed, MPS Commissioner, on the sidelines of the 90th INTERPOL General Assembly.Candidates interested in applying for vacancies or secondments at the INTERPOL General Secretariat are invited to consult www.interpol.int.
