Emerging human trafficking crime is also an increasing concern for police authorities.The international nature of these crimes make it essential for Botswana’s police to be able to cooperate globally with other law enforcement officials.The role of INTERPOL’s National Central Bureau (NCB) in Gaborone is therefore crucial to maintaining regional security. It draws on our capabilities to help Botswana to identify, investigate and prevent the cross-border organized crime which affects it.INTERPOL in BotswanaNCB Gaborone is the lead police platform for national investigations requiring input from other police forces across the globe.It is part of the Criminal Investigation department of the Botswana Police Service and is based in their headquarters in central Gaborone.
