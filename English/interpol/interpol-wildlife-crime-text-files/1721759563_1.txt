Tackling Suriname crimeSuriname is located at a crossroads between North and South America and the Caribbean, making it attractive to transnational criminal organizations wishing to carry out smuggling operations into the region, or to cross it on their way to other continents.Suriname shares borders with three other countries and through its maritime waters has easy access to Caribbean waters and islands, making it an attractive transit country for illegal merchandise transiting between American, European and African markets.The international characteristics of these crime areas and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Suriname fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.
