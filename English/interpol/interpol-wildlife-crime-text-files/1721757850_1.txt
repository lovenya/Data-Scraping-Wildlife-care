SINGAPORE – Preventing the cross-border movement of bomb-makers and undocumented precursor chemical materials used to manufacture bombs was the focus of an operation coordinated by INTERPOL across Southeast Asia.

            Operation Watchmaker saw some 35,000 passengers and more than 270,000 luggage, cargo and vehicles checked across Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines as part of coordinated efforts to put into operation data previously provided by Watchmaker working groups.
    
                                            
    
            Through Operation Watchmaker enforcement agencies were better able to exploit INTERPOL policing capabilities to check cargo, vehicles and luggage.
    
                                            
    
            With participating countries exchanging watch-lists of suspected bomb-makers to crosscheck their potential movement across borders, more than 6,500 fingerprint and facial images of travelers were collected during the operation for further checks against INTERPOL’s dedicated databases.

            Five individuals were arrested at Sandakan Airport in Malaysia after more than 100 kg of methamphetamine were seized as a direct result of the operation due to the use of X-ray machines which were not systematically used beforehand.

Sapla, Head of the Bomb Data Center Directorate for Intelligence in the Philippines.An operational coordination unit at the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore acted as the central point of contact during the operation, bringing together representatives from the three participating countries.Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia, Operation Watchmaker was supported by more than 180 participants from 12 different agencies. These included police, immigration, customs, maritime security, coast guards, port and airport authorities, national bureaus of investigation, intelligence services, transnational crime agencies, counter-terrorism units and mobile brigades.
