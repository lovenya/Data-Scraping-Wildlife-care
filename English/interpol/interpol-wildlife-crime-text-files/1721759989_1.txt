The effects of corruption are far-reaching: it can undermine political, social and economic stability, and ultimately threaten the safety and security of society as a whole.Corruption creates a fertile ground for organized criminal activities, even terrorism, as criminals are aided in their illegal activities by the complicity of corrupt public officials.Economic globalization has made corruption a borderless crime. The competitive world of international business can leave companies exposed to bribes and fraudulent financial practices.Corrupt transactions can cross multiple jurisdictions, making the ensuing police investigation both time-consuming and complex.The INTERPOL Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre (IFCACC)Â  will expand and streamline our existing initiatives in tackling financial crimes, illicit money flows and asset recovery. It will work closely with key stakeholders to strengthen our collective efforts against financial crime and corruption.
