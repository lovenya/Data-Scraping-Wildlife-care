Provided with fake identification documents, travel and accommodation, victims would then be forced into sexual slavery;The arrest of Red Notice subject Johnny Eliexer Cordero Belisario, wanted by the Dominican Republic for large-scale trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation. The 32-year-old Venezuelan national is thought to have lured hundreds of women from Venezuela and Colombia to the Dominican Republic where they would be forced into prostitution;The rescue by Honduras National Police of a two-year old orphan girl who was the victim of attempted smuggling with fraudulent identity documents;Peruvian police arrested five men suspected of being part of a regional human trafficking network, and rescued a Colombian woman and teenage girl, both working in enforced prostitution in Lima;Two Ecuadorian women were arrested at Chile’s Arturo Merino Benítez airport as they tried to enter the country with three children using fraudulent identity documents;Arrest in Bolivia of a man and woman whose commercial company recruited young men and women with promises of highly paid jobs but instead would force them to work in slave-like conditions for no pay.  As part of the operation, Bolivian authorities conducted a national awareness campaign telling citizens how to protect themselves from the threat of human trafficking.“The effects of this large scale trans-border police operation will reach far beyond the Americas, and underlines the value of INTERPOL in helping police in source, transit and destination countries work together in tackling the criminal networks behind human trafficking,” said Tim Morris, INTERPOL’s Executive Director for Police Services.“This is just one example of INTERPOL’s ongoing work in combating human trafficking which affects every region of the world, to ensure that police have the training and tools they need to identify routes, arrest offenders and rescue victims,” added Mr Morris.Migrant smugglingIn addition to targeting trafficking in human beings, Colombia also led several operations targeting migrant smuggling networks.
