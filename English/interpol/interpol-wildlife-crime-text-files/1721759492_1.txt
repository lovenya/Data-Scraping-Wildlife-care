Fighting Caribbean crimeLocated on shipping routes linking the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, the Caribbean is an archipelago of 7,000 islands which are challenging for law enforcement to monitor.With the region proving increasingly attractive to organized crime networks seeking a regional hub to engage in a multitude of serious crimes, Caribbean police forces face the serious crime which comes with drug trafficking, such as trafficking in firearms, people and counterfeit goods, in addition to money laundering and bulk cash smuggling.The international characteristics of these crime areas and their links with organized crime groups around the world make the role of INTERPOL National Central Bureaus (NCBs) in the Caribbean fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.INTERPOL in Aruba            
    
        
            
Located in the capital Oranjestad, the Aruba NCB is part of a dedicated national terrorism and safety unit called the National Central Bureau for Counterterrorism, Security and INTERPOL (NCTVI).By sharing national and regional intelligence with the global counterterrorism community, the NCB helps Aruba safeguard its borders and strengthen national security.The NCB enables police officers across Aruba to detect, investigate and prevent the flow of illicit goods along trafficking routes in and around the country.  They take part regularly in global INTERPOL-led police operations which focus on regional organized crime.Law enforcement in ArubaLaw enforcement services in Aruba are provided by the Aruba Police Force (Korps Politie Aruba), which is under the command of a Police Commissioner.Aruba created the NCTVI in 2018 as part of efforts to strengthen its intelligence-led approach to transnational criminal investigations and counter terrorism tactics.  NCTVI is part of the Ministry of Justice.
