A senior level meeting bringing together leaders of the world’s regional police organizations at INTERPOL has closed with a call to streamline law enforcement strategies and operational actions for greater global impact.Called the ‘Dialogue’ to highlight the need for regional police organizations to work together seamlessly towards a common security goal, particularly as it relates to counter-terrorism, organized crime and border security, the meeting concluded with the formal endorsement of a joint communiqué establishing a roadmap for clearly defined cooperation in dedicated areas.Testimony to a common resolve to put the communiqué into concrete action, Dialogue members created two working groups which will meet regularly to design mechanisms to share strategic plans and align operational actions, and to streamline cross-continental access to operational information in the frontline.
