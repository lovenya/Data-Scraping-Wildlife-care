“Transnational crime is evolving fast and it is critical that police officials around the world are equipped to the highest level to protect their communities against future threats,” said Vice President for Africa Umar.At each RB, the President and EC members also held virtual meetings with NCBs in the associated region, almost 80 countries in total, to hear their challenges and identify ways in which additional assistance can be provided.Extending access to INTERPOL’s I-24/7 network at key border points was a major point of discussion at each RB, with countries eager to benefit from mobile technology allowing frontline officers to run instant checks on INTERPOL’s criminal databases.“This tour has given the Executive Committee real insight into the importance of the Regional Bureaus and will be an area for discussion at the next Executive Committee meeting as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure police in Africa and the Americas have the skillsets and tools required to support global security,” said Vice President for the Americas Urquiza.A supervisory bodyDiversity was also high on the agenda, with the EC members expressing strong support for the 2022 INTERPOL General Assembly resolution to further prioritize the geographical and gender diversity of the organization’s workforce, particularly as it relates to underrepresented countries.The Executive Committee is the governing body in charge of supervising the execution of the General Assembly’s decisions and the administration and work of the General Secretariat.The Committee's members sit at the top level of policing in their own countries and bring many years of experience and knowledge to advise and guide the Organization.The six RBs are part of the General Secretariat structure, each providing policing support services to member countries in their specific regions.
