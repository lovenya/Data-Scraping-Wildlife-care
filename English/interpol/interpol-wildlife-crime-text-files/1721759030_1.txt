Held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, the Unity for Security Forum taking place from 28 to 30 March is an INTERPOL forum organized in partnership with the Government of the United Arab Emirates, and the INTERPOL Foundation for a Safer World.The Forum will bring together ministers, senior government officials, and representatives from the private sector, to collectively discuss and address common issues. It will enable participants to identify their responsibilities in combating future security threats focused around seven INTERPOL projects on counter-terrorism, cybercrime, cultural heritage, vulnerable communities, vehicle crime, drugs and illicit goods.Brigadier General Hamad Ajlan Al Amimi, Director General of the Federal Criminal Police, stressed the importance of strengthening cooperation and partnership with all countries, institutions and international bodies in order to enhance the efforts of the UAE to ensure the safety and security of the community.“Building relations with relevant institutions in the fight against crime, including INTERPOL, its member countries and the INTERPOL Foundation for a Safer World, strengthens the fight against global crime through cooperation,” said Brigadier General Al Amimi.He added that the UAE's support for the INTERPOL seven projects underscores its continued commitment to ensuring the security and safety of the international community and underlines its belief that the fight against crime requires concerted efforts and global coordination.“We welcome the continued partnership and leadership demonstrated by the Government of the United Arab Emirates in sponsoring these seven projects, which deal with some of the complex threats we currently face,” said Elias Murr, President of the INTERPOL Foundation for a Safer World. “This funding will help to ensure we are able to build diverse collaborations that bring together technical expertise and knowledge of the issues that help us to ensure safety and security.”INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock said the contribution comes at a time when the world policing body is being encouraged to play a larger role in improving global security.                                “Time and again world events remind us of how increasingly important it is to stand united in the face of challenges to global security,” said Secretary General Stock. “The generosity of the UAE’s contribution will have a significant impact on strengthening the work of law enforcement worldwide.“The threats posed by terrorism, organized crime and cybercrime are more complex and global than ever, requiring INTERPOL to play an even stronger role in international police cooperation.“However, meeting these global security challenges is not, and should not be, something which police can do in isolation. Expertise and support from the private sector is also essential and the Forum will provide us all with insights on how we can better unify our efforts and meet our individual responsibilities,” concluded the Head of INTERPOL.The projects which are supported by the EUR 50 million contribution seek to address issues within identified priority crime areas from around the world, each designed to deliver specific initiatives and  plans to help combat these crimes.The UAE Vision 2021 National Agenda aims for the UAE to be the safest place in the world, and the efforts by the UAE Ministry of Interior and the various security forces and legislative actions are positioning the nation at the forefront of this priority. The country’s success in protecting all aspects of society has driven key pillars of the economy, including attracting and retaining investments, bolstering tourism and increasing happiness in a diverse community.The UAE became an INTERPOL member country in October 1973, and the INTERPOL National Central Bureau for the UAE is located in Abu Dhabi as part of the Ministry of Interior. It is the key working platform for all international police investigations requiring cooperation with UAE police authorities.While the event is not open to the public, live updates will be provided throughout the event on social media using #UnityForSecurity.
