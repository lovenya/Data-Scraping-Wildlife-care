As a general rule, organized criminal networks are involved in many different types of criminal activities spanning several countries. These activities may include trafficking in people, drugs, illicit goods and weapons, armed robbery, counterfeiting and money laundering.It’s a global businessWith revenues estimated in the billons, their criminal enterprises closely resemble those of legitimate international businesses. They have operating models, long-term strategies, hierarchies, and even strategic alliances, all serving the same purpose: to generate the most profits with the least amount of risk.
    
        Members of organized crime groups often share a common link, for example geographical, ethnic or even blood ties.
            
At the root of this connection is a tight, often unbreakable bond which promotes devotion and loyalty.What we doOur Organized Crime unit works hand in hand with all of INTERPOL’s police services to identify major figures involved in transnational crime, the associated criminal networks and their activities.The ultimate objective is to stop the organizations themselves from operating.We conduct criminal analysis based on intelligence provided by our member countries and partners, such as biometrics, images and known associations. This allows us to provide a global picture and link organizers, financers, recruiters, distributors and corrupt officials, for example.ProjectsOur Organized Crime unit also runs a number of projects which focus on specific types of criminal networks, each of which comes with its unique set of challenges.These projects encourage national and international enforcement bodies to exchange operational data, best practice and lessons learned with a view to dismantling specific groups.
