Tackling organized crime in South East EuropeBosnia and Herzegovina sits in both a transit and destination region for a wide range of crime types including drug trafficking, illegal migration, counterfeit goods and trafficking in human beings.A common regional history, cross-border family ties, shared languages and no-visa border regimes make Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its surrounding region, particularly attractive to Balkan organized crime groups.This environment provides fertile ground for the recruitment of vulnerable youth into organized crime groups and terrorism. Driven by profit, these activities can have devastating economic, social and security impacts on communities.The INTERPOL National Central Bureaus (NCBs) in Southeast Europe have access to our range of policing capabilities, global investigative intelligence and secure network linking them all our member countries. This puts them in a unique position to examine regional organized crime from a global standpoint to help national agencies to protect their people, economies and security.INTERPOL in Bosnia and HerzegovinaNCB Sarajevo is the unique point of contact for police cooperation relating to all Bosnia and Herzegovina investigations with an international link.The NCB monitors regional routes used to traffic human beings, arms, stolen vehicles, drugs and pharmaceuticals.
