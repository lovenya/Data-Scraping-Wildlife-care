Timeframe: 2021 - 2026
Budget: EUR 6.1 million
Donor: European UnionSituationThe Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden constitute one of the world’s major shipping routes. As well as enabling global trade, these waters also present immense opportunities for development and prosperity in the bordering countries.This potential is far from being fulfilled due to regional instability, conflict, piracy and transnational organized crime which endanger the freedom of navigation of vessels through these waters and discourage investment into port infrastructure and maritime commerce.In addition to the security repercussions, these illicit activities have a severe impact on the socio-economic and political conditions in the countries of these regions.About the projectThis project forms part of the Regional Programme for Maritime Security in the Red Sea, funded by the European Union.INTERPOL, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are working together to help beneficiary countries develop their capacity and to promote adequate security and safety standards for maritime, port and land-based law enforcement authorities.The beneficiary countries are Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

Extending access to I-24/7 at ports:  We are extending access to INTERPOL’s secure global communications network (I-24/7) and databases to participating countries. This technical network strengthens cooperation and enables law enforcement agencies to share urgent police information with their counterparts around the globe.Mentorship sessionsMentorship sessions on fisheries crime, drugs trafficking and trafficking in human beings enhanced national authorities’ capabilities and fostered inter-institutional cooperation at a national and regional level. This on-the-ground support increased national coordination and information sharing. 300 officers participated in these sessions held in 2022 and 2023.
