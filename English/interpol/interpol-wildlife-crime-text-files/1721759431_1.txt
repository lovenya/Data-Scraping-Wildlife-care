Investigators will be able to check all INTERPOL databases at once instead of carrying out multiple searches. This will save valuable time and reveal connections that could otherwise go unnoticed.The challengesINTERPOL hosts multiple operational databases and crime analysis files, each one designed for a specific purpose and created at different points in time.This results in a fragmented approach to information management. Currently, police have to search the different databases separately. Not only does this use up valuable time, but any connections between the data held in different places may go overlooked. This affects INTERPOL’s ability to support international criminal investigations.Interoperability between internal databases, and externally with national law enforcement systems, is complex to achieve but is crucial to the success of international policing and global security.How it will workThe Unified Information Architecture project will break down information siloes by creating a common information repository for data.A single search query will return results from all data sources. This centralization will allow data to be interlinked and therefore provide improved intelligence to law enforcement. Access management will also be consolidated to ensure data protection and security.The project will benefit all National Central Bureaus and authorized law enforcement agencies in all INTERPOL member countries.Operational benefitsHarmonization of data formats;Increased data quality and security;Instant access to reliable and complete police information with a single query;A foundation for interoperability between INTERPOL’s Information System and other regional and national systems;Reduced manual interventions.Unified Information Architecture is a pre-condition for future innovative policing capabilities and will form the foundation of INTERPOL’s Global Information Hub.
