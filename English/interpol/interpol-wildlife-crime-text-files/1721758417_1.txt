LYON, France – In an INTERPOL-led crackdown on the criminal groups behind human trafficking and migrant smuggling, authorities across 44 countries have rescued nearly 700 victims of human trafficking.Operation Weka II was carried out from 12 to 17 June, where officers progressed cases and carried out intensified checks at border points. Results so far have yielded a total of 300 arrests, including 88 suspected traffickers and 83 migrant smugglers. Some 100 additional arrests were made for other crimes such as document forgery, organized crime, firearms and drug trafficking, highlighting the poly-criminal nature of organized crime groups.High-profile arrestsWeka II saw successful outcomes for a number of human trafficking cases linked to previous INTERPOL operations. For example, authorities in Morocco located and arrested a 34-year old man long suspected of recruiting, housing and trafficking women from Nigeria to Morocco, then on to Spain and other European destinations, where they were forced into prostitution. This high-profile arrest is the result of sustained cooperation between countries since Operation Weka I (2021).In a separate case, police in Côte d’Ivoire arrested an Ivorian man suspected of running a transnational crime group trafficking women from Morocco and Guinea to Spain for the purpose of sexual exploitation.Identified in the course of 2020’s Operation Turquesa II, this suspect was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice published by Spain. He was arrested at the airport in Abidjan when officers cross-checked his passport against INTERPOL’s databases.“These key arrests show the extent and value of global operations, not only in the moment, but the long-term impact they have in generating leads, exchanging intelligence and establishing networks that are ready to act when the time is right,” said Jürgen Stock, INTERPOL’s Secretary General.
