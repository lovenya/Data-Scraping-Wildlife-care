LYON, France – An Italian fugitive connected to the ‘Ndrangheta mafia network has been arrested in Colombia with support from the INTERPOL Cooperation Against ‘Ndrangheta (I-CAN) Project.Massimo Gigliotti, aged 55, was wanted internationally by Italian authorities under an INTERPOL Red Notice for trafficking large quantities of cocaine from South America to Europe.         
    
        
            
Investigation of the suspect had gathered pace in South America after the I-CAN Project flagged the fugitive last September to authorities in Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Venezuela.Gigliotti was arrested by Colombia’s National Police, after officers from the Carabinieri’s Investigative Operative Department in Bologna analysed and circulated information from EUROPOL. They collaborated with I-CAN and INTERPOL units in Lyon, with support from an Italian officer in Colombia.INTERPOL Director of Operational Support and Analysis Cyril Gout said:“Through this arrest, I-CAN continues to demonstrate its effectiveness in fighting one of the most extensive and powerful criminal organizations in the world.“The I-CAN model is built on providing countries with a cooperation model that brings operational added value, particularly at a time when urgent, coordinated global action is required to tackle transnational organized crime.”Funded by the Italian Department of Public Security, I-CAN raises global awareness and understanding about the ‘Ndrangheta and their modus operandi, sharing police information to dismantle their networks and operations and arrest wanted suspects.Since its launch in 2020 I-CAN has facilitated the arrest of 93 fugitives worldwide.
