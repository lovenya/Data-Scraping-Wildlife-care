“There is therefore a need for increased cooperation and information sharing on crimes related to falsified and illicit medical products being manufactured, transported and sold in the Asian region,” added Ms Plançon.Operation Storm VI was also supported by the Storm Enforcement Network, which was created in 2011 to strengthen coordination and collaboration among police, customs and drug regulatory agencies to combat pharmaceutical crime in the Asia.The results of the operation were reviewed during a Storm Enforcement Network meeting in Myanmar on 8 and 9 December, which gathered some 35 representatives from nine of the participating countries as well as the Western Pacific Regional Office of the World Health Organization, Hong Kong Customs and private industry partners.Soe Myaing, Brigadier General of Myanmar Police said: “Through this meeting, we have shared our knowledge and experiences and encouraged more cooperation between INTERPOL and member countries at the regional and international levels. We are looking forward to future cooperation to prevent pharmaceutical crimes.”
