Fighting organized crime in JordanJordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe, sharing borders with four Middle Eastern countries and small coastal borders on the Dead Sea and Red Sea. It is also located in a crisis conflict zone, making its geographic location attractive to organized criminal groups wanting to carry out smuggling operations across the region, or to cross it on their way to other continents.Jordan’s crime areas of priority concern include trafficking in drugs, firearms, people and fake goods, as well as cybercrime, with these crimes often leading to money laundering and violent crime.The international characteristics of these crime areas and their links with crime networks around the world make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Jordan fundamental to maintaining national and regional security.

It links Jordanian law enforcement agencies to their counterparts worldwide and plays a central role in protecting the country and surrounding region from the expansion of international organized crime.            
    
        
            
By providing globally-sourced intelligence about regional crime, the NCB helps police officers across Jordan to detect and investigate the flow of illicit goods along trafficking routes in and around the country.The NCB helps the PSD to work with police forces across the world in investigating crime and bringing criminals to justice. The NCB in Amman regularly takes part in INTERPOL-led police operations in the region.Law enforcement in JordanLaw enforcement services in Jordan are provided by the Public Security Directorate which is part of the Ministry of Interior.Under the command of a Director General, five regional security commanders oversee the police activities of the Metropolitan, Northern, Southern, Central and Al-Aqaba regions in addition to the Royal Bedouin forces.
