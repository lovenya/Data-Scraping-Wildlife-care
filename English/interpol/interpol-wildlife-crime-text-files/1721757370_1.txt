INTERPOL has published the first INTERPOL-United Nations Security Council Special Notices for four entities identified by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee as being associated with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.The Special Notices for entities are part of on-going efforts by INTERPOL and the UN to assist member countries implement assets freeze and arms embargo sanctions. They are distributed to all of INTERPOL's 186 member countries and serve to alert them that sanctions are in place against the targeted entities.The publication of notices for entities follows the publication since 2005 of similar notices for individuals included on the UN Consolidated List. More than 300 notices for individuals and entities have now been listed on INTERPOL's website.'INTERPOL plays a vital role in helping police in its 186 member countries share critical crime-related information. The publication of these Special Notices will alert law enforcement in our member countries about hidden terrorist activities and help countries to identify potential links to these entities,' said INTERPOL Executive Director of Police Services Jean-Michel Louboutin.UN Security Council Resolution 1617, unanimously adopted in July 2005, called on the UN Secretary General to work with INTERPOL to develop effective tools to assist the UN Security Council Al-Qaeda/Taliban (1267) Committee to carry out its mandate regarding freezing of assets, a travel ban and arms embargo aimed at groups and individuals associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban.INTERPOL’s General Assembly in 2005 welcomed the UN resolution and approved that INTERPOL’s General Secretariat should devise ways to increase co-operation with the UN in the fight against terrorist acts by Al-Qaeda and the Taliban as well as associated individuals and entities, and for that purpose the INTERPOL General Secretariat created the Special Notice.
