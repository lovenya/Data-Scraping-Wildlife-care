SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic - Dominican authorities have made INTERPOL databases accessible at national borders so that officers can screen people, goods, vehicles and vessels against millions of INTERPOL records.Based on funding from the European Union (Project Crimjust), the INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Santo Domingo has been working hand in hand with the General Secretariat for the past 18 months to ensure its police force stands firmly on the cutting edge of innovation in safeguarding national boundaries from illegitimate use.

                    With criminals and terrorists often traveling using falsified identity documents, making INTERPOL databases accessible at national borders is an essential part of combating transnational crime.
            
 Dominican Police can now crosscheck global intelligence against national databases and search INTERPOL databases in real time as part of their investigations and enhanced border security strategies.Police have direct access to more than 88 million identity and travel documents reported stolen in almost 200 countries. With criminals and terrorists often traveling using falsified identity documents, this kind of border security is an essential part of combating transnational crime.Because border checks against INTERPOL databases provide information in real-time, border police can now detain potential criminals on the spot.Since enabling police throughout the Dominican Republic to access INTERPOL’s databases, the amount of daily queries made by the Dominican Republic has increased from 100 to more than 100,000.The Dominican Republic is one of 12 countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and West Africa that INTERPOL’s Project Crimjust supports to counter organized crime along cocaine trafficking routes. The project aims to strengthen associated criminal investigations and foster international cooperation amongst criminal justice institutions.INTERPOL is currently helping modernize police forces in all regions so they can share and receive police information and give frontline police the capacity to better detect criminals or criminal activity. Many INTERPOL member countries have also expanded access to INTERPOL’s vital tools and services to key frontline policing services.With INTERPOL databases queried 230 times every second over its secure global police communications system I-24/7, INTERPOL’s global databases and network are amongst the most advanced capabilities the Organization provides member countries to prevent and investigate crime.
