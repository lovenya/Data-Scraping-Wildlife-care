Watch the trailer here The film comprising of six languages including Hindi and English, has been shot across north-east as well as three international borders. The film seemingly bears resemblance to the successful Hollywood film 'Babel' in its use of language. It portrays three main issues of the northeastern states which are children caught in conflicts, drug addiction and abuse and animal poaching and the necessity of wildlife conservation. Director Sanjib Dey said, "It's a big moment for our entire cast and crew as we finally launch the trailer of our film. This film has been really very close to our heart for more reasons than one. It was filmed over a period of two years set in various politically sensitive locations in Northeast India." "The film speaks about the whole of the Northeast representing the special region which is a warehouse of eight provinces, more than 200 dialects, huge ethnic diversities, rich natural resources and yet encompassed with many conflicts and hard-hitting issues," he added. 'III Smoking Barrels' has travelled to top International Film Festivals winning audience accolades and multiple awards along the way. These include the Silver Palm Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 12th Mexico International Film Festival 2018 and Best Film (other languages) at the Prag Cine Awards 2018 among several others. An Amit Malpani production stars Indraneil Sengupta, Subrat Dutta, Shiny Gogoi, Siddharth Boro, Mandakini Goswami and Amrita Chattopadhyay among others.
