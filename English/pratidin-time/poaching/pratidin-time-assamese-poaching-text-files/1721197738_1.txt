Police on late Sunday night arrested a rhino poacher in Assam's Behali reserve forest in Behali. Following a successful operation carried out by the forest officials of Behali reserve forest in the Jinjinia centre, the man was arrested in help with local police and forest security officials. The poacher has been identified as one named Abdul Barek. He was in radar of police and forest officials following a Rhino poaching case that goes back to 2016. Rhino poaching in Assam is one of the major environmental issues in India which continues in the region of Kaziranga National Park, Manas National Park and some other grasslands of Assam. Illegal rhino horn trade has been the main problem facing managers of the rhino-protected areas of Assam. Some other parts like nails, skins have very high value in Asian traditional medicinal market, which has led to increased cases of rhino killing in the recent years.
