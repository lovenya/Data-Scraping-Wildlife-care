In their relentless operation against rhino poachers, Jakhalabandha Police on Saturday arrested two associates of a rhino poaching team at Kaliabor. The poachers have been identified as Ramnath Tanti and Badhna Mura, who worked as associates for the Manipuri poaching team which had killed a rhino on May 11 at Kukurakata in Kaziranga National Park. The police later arrested the Manipuri poachers acting on intelligence inputs, whose confessions led to the arrest of Ramnath and Badhna.
