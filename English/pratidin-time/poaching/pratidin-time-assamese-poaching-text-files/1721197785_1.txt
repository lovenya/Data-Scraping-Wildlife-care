Bollywood actor Salman Khan on Thursday was warned by a Jodhpur court on Thursday over his absence during a hearing in the blackbuck poaching case. District Judge Chandra Kumar Songra in the District and Sessions Court (Rural) said that the court would cancel his bail if he fails to appear in the next hearing on September 27. However, Khan's counsel Hastimal Saraswat said that an application was filed on Thursday seeking exemption for the actor from making a personal appearance in the court. He said Khan's hearing was scheduled on Thursday in his conviction case in reference to his five years' imprisonment announced on April 5, 2018, by the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court. Khan was later granted bail after two days that is on April 7. It may be mentioned here that the 'Dabangg' actor was convicted for shooting two blackbucks in Kankani village in Rajasthan back in 1998 during the filming of a movie. The discussion on his appeal was to be held on Thursday. Salman Khan had appeared in the District and Sessions Court on May 7 for a hearing on appeal in the blackbuck poaching case, challenging the five-year sentence handed to him by the trial court.
