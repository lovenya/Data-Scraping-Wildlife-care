From working as a production assistant to Anurag Kashyap to directing short films featuring Chetana Das and Barasha Rani Bishaya, budding Assamese director Bandita Bora has come a long way. Sharing the experience she gained by working in different industries, Bandita says, "It is very different. Different cultures and societies behave differently to a common thing or common humour. As a child, I was fortunate to have been introduced to several cultures through television series. So, it wasn't difficult for me to connect to the various industries and cultures. But yes, it is different everywhere."
