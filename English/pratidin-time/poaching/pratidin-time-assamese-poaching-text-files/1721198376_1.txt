A one-horned rhino was found dead with its horn removed at Kaziranga National Park in Assam on Saturday morning, leading to speculations of poaching in the vicinity. Sources revealed that the carcass of the rhino was found in the Burapahar range within the national park. The horn was missing from the carcass, suggesting the rhino had fallen victim to poaching. Following the tragic discovery, forest officials were informed who reached the scene soon after to recover the carcass for post-mortem. The exact cause of its death is yet to be ascertained but since the horn was taken, it is believed that poachers were behind the killing. Earlier this month, the carcass of a rhino was recovered in Gai Tapu under the Kaziranga National Park. The carcass was spotted by workers of Gai Tapu near the banks of the river. The rhino is suspected to have died due to age-related issues.
