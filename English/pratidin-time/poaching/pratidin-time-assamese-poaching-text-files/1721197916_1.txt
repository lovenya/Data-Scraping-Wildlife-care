A documentary on the rhino conservation efforts in Kaziranga National Park (KNP) with former cricketer Kevin Pietersen will be aired on Tuesday night at National Geographic Channel at 1 pm and will repeat the show at 9 pm on the occasion of World Rhino Day. The documentary titled 'Save This Rhino will focus on rhino conservation activities. Assam's Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya also took to Twitter to inform about the long-awaited documentary's premiere. Sharing the trailer of the upcoming documentary, Suklabaidya wrote, "Join @KP24 Pietersen in his exploring journey to @kaziranga_ & the rhinos of Assam as he features our majestic pride at the global television arena at @NatGeo on 22nd September at 9 PM."

With rhinos predicted to become extinct soon, there's never been a more critical time to guarantee the future of these beautiful animals. But securing their survival is going to be a tough fight, according to the new documentary series 'Save This Rhino' on National Geographic.

Pietersen, who has turned into a rhino conservationist after his retirement from cricket, has explored the conservation success story of Kaziranga in reviving the dwindling population of the one-horned rhino. He has also used the short film to bust myths surrounding the pachyderm, including how the rhino is poached for its horn on the basis of non-scientific beliefs.
