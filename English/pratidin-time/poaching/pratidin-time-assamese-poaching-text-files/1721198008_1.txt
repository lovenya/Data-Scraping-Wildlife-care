Amid the political drama unveiled in Maharashtra, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Sushmita Dev on Wednesday said not to distract Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma from flood situation as the rebel Shiv Sena MLAs led by Eknath Shinde arrived in Guwahati today morning and are camping at Hotel Radisson Blu. I hear MLAs of Maharashtra coming to Assam as part of the poaching exercise. Parts of Assam are so flooded that there is no drinking water or electricity. Pls don’t distract @himantabiswa he needs to focus on this grave situation. 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/7YQOdHQoyA In a recent update to the Assam floods situation, there was no respite for people across the flood-hit areas, especially in the western and southern parts of Assam though much of the northeast had an almost rainless day on Tuesday.
