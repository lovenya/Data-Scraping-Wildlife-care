A man named Vimal Karia in Gujarat’s Porbandar has filed a petition with the magistrate to annul his marriage after finding out that the woman he had married six months ago, was a wanted criminal in Assam. As per reports, Rita had claimed to come from a poor family in Assam and her brother and sister-in-law were involved in manual labour.  She also told that her mother was not keeping well and hence, they decided to get married within one week of meeting each other.
