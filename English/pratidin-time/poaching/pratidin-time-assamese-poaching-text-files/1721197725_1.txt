Assam BJP president while campaigning for the upcoming Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council (RHAC) election in Goalpara said that after six months Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal will become Sarbadhinayak. "After implementation of Clause 6 of Assam Accord in six months, our CM Sonowal will become the Sarbadhinayak from Jatiya Nayak," said Dass. It should be noted that there prevails uncertainty over the High Level committee on implementation of Clause 6 formed by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, as several members including chairman MP Bezbaruah, Nagen Saikia, Rong Bong Terang, AASU and others walked out of the nine-member committee. Speaking to the gathering in Dudhnoi, the State BJP president said that Dr Hiren Gohain, Hemen Das, and others, who are criticizing the government for the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill do not know anything about the people of Assam. "They think that Assam begins and ends in Guwahati. Only because they live in Guwahati and take part in television talk shows, they think that they are intellectuals," said Dass. Taking jibe at Congress, while addressing the election rally, Dass said that Ministers and MLAs of Congress were involved in Rhino poaching, hence there were such incidents reported during their regime.
