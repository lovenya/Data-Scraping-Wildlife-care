The Congress has called for an urgent meeting of theCongress Working Committee (CWC) on Monday after a chance at power inMaharashtra is in the offing. The CWC meeting will take place at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi'sDelhi residence at 10 am on today. The meeting comes hours after major political developments inMaharashtra â€” the BJP declaring that it can't form the government in thestate, the Governor the Shiv Sena to stake a claim as well as Sena's lone UnionMinister announcing his resignation from the Modi cabinet. Heading to Delhi after meeting senior party leaders in Jaipur,where Maharashtra Congress MLAs are currently lodged, Mallikarjun Kharge said,"There's a meeting at 10 am today. We will proceed according to aninstruction from the high command. But our original decision and decision ofthe people is that we should sit in opposition that is the presentposition." Reports have suggested that Maharashtra Congress MLAsare keen to provide outside support to a Shiv Sena-NCP government in the statebut party chief Sonia Gandhi remains hesitant over aligning with the right-wingSena. According to sources in the Congress, the party legislators fromMaharashtra met in Jaipur with senior leaders to discuss the possibility ofsupporting a Sena-led government. Meanwhile, other key players too are all going into theirrespective huddles. The Shiv Sena will be holding a meeting with its MLAs atthe Retreat resort in Mumbai, where they have been kept to prevent poaching bythe BJP. Similarly, a BJP core group meeting will be held today at theresidence of caretaker CM Devendra Fadnavis. Sunday's fast-paced developments seem to have increased thebargaining power of opposition Congress and NCP, as the Sena, which has 56MLAs, is far away from the halfway mark of 145.
