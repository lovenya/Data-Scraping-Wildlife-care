Led by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators will meet with President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday to complain against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) attempts to “buy” its legislators. However, the BJP has denied the allegations and said that the AAP is trying to divert attention from corruption cases.
