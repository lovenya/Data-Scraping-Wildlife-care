First thing first. Incidents of poaching related to rhinoceros in various forest reserves of Assam in Northeast India have decreased drastically. Brutal laws against the poachers, strengthening of ground staff inside the protected forest areas and increasing public awareness in the fringe localities of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries across the State have positively impacted the mission to save the one-horned rhinos. Unlike other parts of the globe, common people of Assam irrespective of their political, ethnic or religious differences, maintain a strong will to protect the giant animals.
