Acting on a tip-off, a suspected poacher was apprehended by Assam police in Rangia under Kamrup district on Sunday. The police also recovered one rhino horn from his possession. The arrested person has been identified as Zahirul Islam. It is noteworthy to mention that a week back, a carcass of a rhino was recovered inside the Orang National Park.

The carcass of the rhino was spotted near Borkhe forest camp inside the Orang National Park.

The horn was found to be chopped off, but there was no bullet injury. The forensic evaluation regarding the same was shared with the Assam police,” the DGP said. The top cop also assured to take stern action against culprits found to be involved in rhino poaching activity. “Wherever such incidents will occur, Assam police will not spare any effort to improve the police system as well service delivery to the people,” added DGP GP Singh.
