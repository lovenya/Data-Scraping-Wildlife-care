Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Wednesday has appointed 90 constables, thus, forming the crux of Special Rhino Protection Force raised by the state government. The newly recruited constables are slated to maintain liaison with the higher ups of the security mechanism of the Kaziranga National Park to form a team to protect the wild lives from poachers. Addressing the new appointees, Sonowal said, "Protecting rhinos along with other wild lives are our commitment and raising the special force is a step towards protecting our rhinos from poaching". The CM said that the newly recruited constables will be provided advanced training to tackle all sorts of situations and stressed upon developing this force as one of the most dynamic one by including the spirit of Smart policing and personality development. The government of Assam has raised the Special Rhino Protection Force from people living in the fringe areas of the Kaziranga National Park. "Strengthening the forest protection mechanism by regular appointments and imparting technical training to employees are essential for sustainable management of forest and environment conservation", said Sonowal. The government has formed fast track courts to bring the perpetrators of wild life crime to justice. The Special Rhino Protection Force would be exclusively used for Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park and Manas National Park. Featured Image: Twitter
