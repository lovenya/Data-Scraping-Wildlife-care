Biswanath District Congress Committee on Saturday evening withdrew the nomination of the 'rhino poacher' for the upcoming Panchayat polls. Prior to this, Dilowar Hussain, a 'rhino poacher' of Suaguri village in Biswanath was nominated by the Congress party to contest for the seat of Gaon Panchayat's President. Reports suggested that several cases of rhino poaching have been registered against him at the Biswanath Police Station and Bagori Police Station. "In the year 2011, he (Hussain) was involved in a rhino poaching case. Though as per law, a person who has a case going on against him/her can still contest; we withdraw his nomination," stated Biswanath District Congress Committee president Dilip Baruah. Candidature of Dilowar had shocked and demoralized the Assam police and the Kaziranga National Park authorities as the poacher was arrested multiple occasions and currently out on bail.
