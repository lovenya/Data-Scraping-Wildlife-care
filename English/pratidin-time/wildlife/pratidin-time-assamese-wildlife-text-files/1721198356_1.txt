The report of the Wing also revealed that 14 tusks, mostlybabies of 4-6 years old had been sent outside within 3-4 years from DoomdoomaForest Division to Bihar alone and 18 elephants were displayed for sale inSonpur Mela. Without any revenue generation, males became more difficultto keep and maintain, they were primarily sold to Kerala State, through Bihar'sSonepur Mela. In the state till 30.12.2018, there were 905 captiveelephants in the records of the Forest Department. Assam has a traditional association with elephant keepingâ€”elephant keeping methods that provided near-natural living conditions for itscaptive population, in a forest environment with opportunity to interact withwild counterparts Elephants in private ownership are the victims of poor owners, agents, brokers and often can be misused or abused for commercial reasons. Owners hire them or lease them to distant places for logging, dragging heavy loads, filming commercial movies and other varied activities. When needed they are sold to other states, for religious, entertainment or commercial activity through a network of highly organised and complex system, designed by the traders of this lucrative trade. However, even in poverty, captive elephants kept in Assamlead a better quality of life compared to those maintained in other states inIndia or in other non-range countries. In captivity in non-range countries,even with intense management and resource expenditure, natural livingconditions have not been able to be created. The social life of Assam's captive elephants replicatenear-natural conditions as compared to those maintained in isolation in statessuch as Kerala/Tamil Nadu or Bihar. Similarly, access to natural water sources(river/stream) in Assam cannot be found in a state like Rajasthan or Punjab.
