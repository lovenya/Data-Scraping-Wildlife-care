Total five hog deer died within a week after one of the worst floods in Assam led to the submergence of the Kaziranga National Park (KNP). The flood water also encroached upon the camps of forest guards. The death toll is likely to rise after the entire floodwater gets out of the park. Forest teams have managed to rescue at least 8 hog deer (1 died on Arrival) and released them after special treatment at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), India's only wildlife field hospital in Kaziranga. Divisional Forest Officer of Eastern Assam Wildlife Division (Bokakhat) Rohini Ballave Saikia informed these in a press statement on Sunday.
