Around 30 wild elephants wreaked havoc on paddy fields at Thuramukh in Golaghat last night. The herd of elephants is believed to have come out of the Nambor-Doigrung Wildlife Sancturay in search of food. The locals have accused the forest department of having failed at averting such attacks by wild elephants.
