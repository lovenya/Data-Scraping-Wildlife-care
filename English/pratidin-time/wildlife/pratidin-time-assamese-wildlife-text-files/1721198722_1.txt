Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday said that India is “not a constitutional democracy”, rather it’s a “civilization democracy”. Speaking on the folk culture of the state, he said that today there has been a renewed consciousness among the Assamese people about its folk heritage. Due to the foresight and dedicated efforts of pioneers like Suryya Kumar Bhuyan, Birinchi Kumar Baruah, Hem Chandra Baruah and many others, the study of folk culture as an academic discipline has taken root in the state.
