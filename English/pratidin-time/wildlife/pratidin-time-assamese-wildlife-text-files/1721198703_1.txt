Do you remember 'Babu'? The wild elephant that had strayed into Guwahati sparking panic and causing traffic snarls on April 30. The elephant is not quite well now-a-days. It has developed infections over its body. The forest department has failed to provide proper treatment to it. Asper the locals of Botahghuli area in the city, Babu has been continuouslytrying to come out of the Amchang Wildlife Sanctuary ever since it was releasedinside the sanctuary. Itmay be mentioned here that the Forest Department had put a collar around Babu'sneck to monitor his movements. And due to the collar, the elephant herds in theAmchang Wildlife Sanctuary have boycotted Babu. The other elephants in fact attackedBabu on several occasions, informed a forest official on the condition ofanonymity. Babu has developed infections due to the collar and especially following the attacks of other elephants in the wildlife sanctuary. Its health has also been deteriorated following the attacks. Now the forest department should provide proper medication and take care of the gentle jumbo that walked passed the vehicles and noisy crowds in Guwahati on April 30, without causing any damage.
