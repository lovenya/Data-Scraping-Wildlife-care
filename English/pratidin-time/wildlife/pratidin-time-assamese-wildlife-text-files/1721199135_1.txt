Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday revelled in Assam's performance in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index 2023-24 report published by the NITI Aayog. "We have become green," he said hinting at the rise in rankings from the previous report. Assam's overall points in the recently published report stood at 65, eight better than the previous assessment, propelling the state to the "Front Runner" category. However, Assam still stood 23rd out of 28 states in the country. Notably, states securing between 0 and 49 fall under the 'Aspirant' category, 50-64 under 'Performer', 65-99 under 'Front Runner', and 100 for 'Achievers'. SDGs are a set of 17 goals adopted by all members of the United Nations In 2015 to be achieved by 2030. The SDG India Index is a report published by the NITI Aayog to promote healthy competition among states to ensure that they work towards achieving these goals, in turn contributing in the nation's overall rise and development. Noteworthy here is that India, as a whole, scored 71 in the 2023-24 index, bettering its score of 66 in the last evaluation. "Now we have become a Front Runner state. Assam's journey started from the Aspirant category. We became Performer. In two years of our government, we took Assam to Front Ranking state," said Chief Minister Sarma. Assam has gradually increased its ranking year-on-year to ensure SDGs are met state-wide, translating into its gradual rise in the rankings.
