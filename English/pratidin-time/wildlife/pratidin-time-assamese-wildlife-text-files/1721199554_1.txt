In an attempt to bring the Borail Wildlife Sanctuary in Barak Valley of Assam to limelight while integrating the indigenous people living around the sanctuary by ensuring sustainable generation of livelihood for the people, the Borail eco camp was inaugurated on Friday. The Borail eco camp is a confluence of Conservation, Community and Sustainable Tourism. That is to say the facility will be fully operated and run by the local community - the eco development committee of the Indranagar village.
