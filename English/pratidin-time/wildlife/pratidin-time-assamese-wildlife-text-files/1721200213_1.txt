Over 6,000 workers were evacuated from the National Hydro Electric Power Corporation (NHPC) project site of the Subansiri dam at Gerukamukh in the Dhemaji district of Assam on Sunday. It may be noted that the guard walls of Subansiri dam collapsed on Saturday. The wall collapsed after the accumulation of excess water in the dam due to heavy rainfall in Assam for the past few days breaking the water-carrying capacity.
