The Kaziranga National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary once again reels under flood as the water of Brahmaputra and Diphlu River enter the parks. Some areas of Bagori and Burha Hills and tourist roads have been submerged under flood in Kaziranga. The authorities said that it would be difficult for them to open the park for tourists as they need time to clean the park once the flood water reduced. The authorities said that they can repair the roads only when the water gets reduced. The authoritiesfurther said that they need to start the work in the first week of October sothat they could open the park for tourists from the middle of the month. On the otherhand, 40% of the area in Pobitora has been submerged under water along withfive camps.
