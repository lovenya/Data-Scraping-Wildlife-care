A decline of 69 percent has been reported in the wildlife population globally since 1970. WWF India officials said at the launch that most of India’s river systems are not free flowing and hence their biodiversity has declined. In 2019, 205 species from India were in the ‘endangered’, 81 in the ‘critically endangered’ and 394 in ‘vulnerable’ category on the ‘red list’ of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), they added.
