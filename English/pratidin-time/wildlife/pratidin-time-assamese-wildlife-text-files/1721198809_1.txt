The people of Arunachal Pradesh are renowned for their lively celebrations and dynamic dance performances. During each festival, the tribes of the state come together in perfect harmony to showcase their traditional attire, jewelry, music, and dance. These captivating folk dances not only add to the festive atmosphere but also narrate tales of valor that have been passed down through generations via word of mouth. The Bhuiya dance is a joyful dance performed by both Digaru Mishmi women and men, often after grand feasts or family gatherings, and also during festivals like Tazampu, Duiya, and Tanuya, which helps to strengthen the bond between people.
