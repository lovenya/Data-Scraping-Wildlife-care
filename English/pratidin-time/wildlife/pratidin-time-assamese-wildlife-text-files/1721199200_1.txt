The state of Assam is all set to host the first set of G20 events, with delegates arriving in the city. But the question arises as to how many days the city will look as beautiful as the bride. The citizens when asked as how they feel towards a new look of, one of the citizens said, “It’s good that the city has been cleaned up for the upcoming events but why is the government concerned about the city only when a special event has been organized. Can’t the city get this look always and forever? Guwahati has been said as the gateway to Northeast but the city is always filled with dirt?” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma shared on Twitter a video of a traditional musical performance at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport to welcome the delegates on Monday and hoped that the guests will enjoy their visit.
