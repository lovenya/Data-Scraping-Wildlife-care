The Karbi Anglong Superitendent of Police has been entrusted to probe into illegal stone quarrying activities in Kaziranga National Park ,within a 10-km radius by the office of the director general of police ,after a complaint was raised by environment activist Rohit Choudhury. "You are requested to inquire into the issue, take necessary action as per law and submit an action taken report to the (police) headquarters for perusal of the director general of police Assam, for perusal at the earliest," the letter said. The National Tiger Conservation Authority in April this year had asked the state government to ban stone stone quarrying and mining in Karbi Anglong immediately as the activities had emerged as a serious threat to ecology and wildlife in the Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong landscape. The Supreme Court's on a order on  December 4, 2006 stated that all cases where environmental clearances were granted for activities within 10-km of the protected area should be referred to the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL).
