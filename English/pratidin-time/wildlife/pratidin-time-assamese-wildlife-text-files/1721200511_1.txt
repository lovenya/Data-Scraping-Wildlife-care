It may be mentioned that on February 14, the district administration in Nagaon and Sonitpur carried out an eviction drive to free the wildlife sanctuary from illegal encroachment. The massive encroachment drive was being carried out to free nearly 1,892 hectares of land from illegal occupation. According to the district administration of Sonitpur and Nagaon, huge areas of government land were illegally occupied by encroachers in the area and the administration had already issued notices to the occupying people to vacate the lands.
