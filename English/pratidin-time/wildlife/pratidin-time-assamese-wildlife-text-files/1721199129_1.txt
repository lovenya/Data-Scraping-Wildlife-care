World Zoonoses Day, celebrated annually on July 6th, commemorates the pioneering work of Louis Pasteur, a distinguished French biologist. In 1885, Pasteur achieved a breakthrough by administering the first rabies vaccine, a pivotal moment in the history of preventing zoonotic diseases. This day not only honors Pasteur's contributions but also serves as a vital platform for raising global awareness about various zoonosesâ€”diseases transmitted from animals to humans.
