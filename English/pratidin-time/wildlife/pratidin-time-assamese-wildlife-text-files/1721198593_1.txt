On Monday, forest guard inadvertently killed a rhino at the Agaratoli range under Kaziranga National Park. As per statement of the forest guard 'The incident took place accidentally, the attack was sudden and from close range, I didn't have time to flee and one bullet from my rifle hit the rhino.' Reportedly, the forest guard opened fire at a herd of rhinos to chase them away in an act of self-defence. However, forest official assured proper investigation regarding the matter. As per 2015 figures, there are around 2,400 rhinos in the park. But every year, many fall prey to natural disasters like floods and poachers bullets. (Representative image: World Wildlife Fund )
