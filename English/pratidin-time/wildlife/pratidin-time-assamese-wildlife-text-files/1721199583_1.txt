A one-horned rhinoceros died in Pobitora on Monday. The dead female rhinoceros was found in the Tuplung camp range area of Pobitra Wildlife Sanctuary. The rhino is suspected to be dead due to the heavy monsoons that have triggered floods across Assam. The national parks and wildlife sanctuaries of the state are severely affected every year due to the floods. Tuplung is one of the anti-poaching camps and habitat for rhinoceros in the sanctuary. Kuchiyani, Kolabhuyan, Kukkari, and Nekera are the other anti-poaching camps. Pobitora is the world's densest habitat of the Great Indian one-horned rhinoceros.
