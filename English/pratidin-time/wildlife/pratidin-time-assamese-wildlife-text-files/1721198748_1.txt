The members of the Indian Women's cricket team including star player Mithali Raj on Friday visited the Kamakhya temple in Guwahati and offered their prayers amid tight security. Not surprisingly, fans in Guwahati have thronged to see their favourite cricketing daughters. India lost the three-match series to England after being defeated once again in Guwahati in the second T20I on Thursday. They will play the third match of the series on Saturday. Notably, England women's cricket team had visited Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary on Tuesday.
