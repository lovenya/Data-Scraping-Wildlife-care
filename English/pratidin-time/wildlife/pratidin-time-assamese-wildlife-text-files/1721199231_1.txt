Nagaland, a northeastern state in India, is a region renowned for its natural beauty and rich biodiversity. It is a place of stunning landscapes, from lush green hills and forests to sparkling waterfalls, and vibrant flora and fauna. The state is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, some of which are endemic to the region, making it a treasure trove for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. The lush green forests of Nagaland are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including several endangered species such as the hoolock gibbon, clouded leopard, and the rare Naga Hill myna. The state is also home to a variety of medicinal plants, which are used by the local tribes for traditional healing practices. Triple Falls, found specifically in the charming Seithekima Village of Nagaland, is one of the most beautiful places in the state. These three sparkling streams tumble down from an impressive height of 280 feet, creating a breathtaking view as they converge into a natural pool. The Nagaland tourism department does an excellent job maintaining the falls and their surroundings, adorning them with lovely flora. Not only is Triple Falls a sight to behold, but it also offers an exciting trekking experience. It's no wonder that this attraction is considered one of the top places to visit in Dimapur.
