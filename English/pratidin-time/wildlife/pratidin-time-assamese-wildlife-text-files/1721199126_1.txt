We know from our visit how dedicated all the staff in Kaziranga are in caring for the Park's wildlife, and can only begin to imagine what a difficult time this must be. Catherine and I greatly admire the work you and the rangers at Kaziranga are doing to risk your own safety, rescue animals, and contain the damage."
