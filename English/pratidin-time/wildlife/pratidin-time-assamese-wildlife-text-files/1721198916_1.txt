An exceptional initiative has seen in the various regions in Morigaon town on Monday morning. A group of youths of an organisation named "XOHAI" had come out altogether to make the city clean in an exceptional way. Reportedly the organisation have collected the banana treesfrom the city, which were used in the evening of Diwali to hold the Diyas andlights, and carried these to the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary for elephant food. It's known to everyone that, man-elephant conflict is very familiar to all of the people these days. Interestingly, the unfortunate incidents take place due to elephant food, as the elephants come out in search of food. But people use to occupy their areas and so it causes a lack of food for the elephants. It may be stated that the organisation has been providing the used banana trees in the Pobitara Wildlife Sanctuary for the last 8 years. Genuinely, all the public praises the initiative taken by the organisation for their deeds.
