In a bid to enhance safety of the wildlife in Kaziranga National Park, theÂ Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) shall install hi-tech covered conductors in prime locations of the park, especially along designated elephant corridors. The state government has made the decision to install covered conductors for transmission of power in wake of electrocution incidents taking place in the region. Power Minister Topon Gogoi told UNI that covered conductors shall be installed along a frequented elephant corridor. "Two power feeders will also be covered, running a stretch of 11 kilometres" he added. APDCL MD Puru Gupta informed that the covered conductors are cables with multiple layers of cover and has several advantages such as no leakage, long-lasting and less prone to damage by wind, storm or other such natural causes.
