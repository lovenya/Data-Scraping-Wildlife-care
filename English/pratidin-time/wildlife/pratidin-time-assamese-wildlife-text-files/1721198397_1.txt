A herd of 10-11 wild elephants caused terror in Samaguri. The elephants have been destroying croplands  at Hahsora Borali Gaon. The villagers had to patrol the Chaparmukh Silghat rail track to scare away the elephants and there  have been allegations against forest department officials of not taking any steps. The villagers are living in terror anticipating elephant attack. On the other hand a  herd of wild elephants have been creating havoc in Golaghat's Thuramukh area. Hundreds of elephants came out from Doigrung Wildlife Sanctuary in search of food and rampaged through the villages. The wild elephant destroyed croplands at Thurajaan, Rongajaan, Abhayjaan and  Murfuloni. As per local nature-lover, most long-term measures require humans to modify their behavior. Conflict mitigation cannot be solved by the Forest Department alone; it requires multidisciplinary collaborations between the Department of Agriculture, insurance companies, land-use planners, biologists and the Forest Department. The implementation of these methods requires a long time frame as well as political will. (Featured image : indianexpress.com)
