With her unique focus on raising awareness about unconventional forms of environmental hazards such as noise pollution and sand mining, Abdulali has garnered widespread recognition and numerous awards for her exceptional contributions. Norma Alvares, part of the esteemed Alvares environmentalist couple, has emerged as a prominent figure in India's environmental conservation landscape. Born in the scenic state of Goa, Alvares, a recipient of the prestigious Padma Shri award in 2002, has collaborated with her partner to initiate numerous environmental conservation projects that have played a pivotal role in preserving the state's traditional environmental heritage.

Sarla Behn, born on April 5, 1901, and passing away on July 8, 1982, played a crucial role in the evolution of the Chipko Movement in India. As a Gandhian environmental activist, she dedicated herself to raising awareness about the severe environmental destruction occurring in the Himalayan forests of the region. Although her role in the Chipko movement was equally significant as that of its spearheaders, Sarla Behn's contributions often went unnoticed.

Apart from her significant contributions as a public health activist, Chakravarty has dedicated her life to conserving the environment and promoting public health causes.

Kinkri Devi, born in 1927 and passing away on December 30, 2007, was an Indian activist and environmentalist best known for her relentless fight against illegal mining and quarrying in her home state of Himachal Pradesh. Despite living in conditions of abject poverty as a sweeper, Devi recognized her responsibility as a true citizen of the Earth and took up environmental causes on her own. Her extraordinary dedication and courage earned her the title of an exemplary ordinary woman. Tulsi Gowda, an environmentalist from the state of Karnataka in India, has dedicated her life to the conservation of nature. Despite being a septuagenarian, Gowda continues to nurture the environment by planting saplings and taking care of nurseries under the Forest Department. Her unwavering commitment to preserving nature has earned her numerous accolades and recognition. Indira Gandhi, born on November 19, 1917, and who sadly passed away on October 31, 1984, was not only India's first and only woman Prime Minister but also an early environmentalist in the country.
