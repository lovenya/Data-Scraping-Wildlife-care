The Chief Minister today also visited the Outer Jonai and Bera Sapori areas in Jonai and took stock of the devastation caused by flood while interacting with the inmates of a flood relief camp there, an official release informed. Sonowal reviewed the flood situation of Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Majuli apart from Jonai and took stock of the progress of various schemes implemented by Water Resource Department. He directed the department to expedite the embankment repairing works to provide protection to the people in those districts from floods. The department was directed to prevent floods caused by Suwansiri, Dikrong Rivers at Jamuguri, stop the damage caused at Kenmili embankment in Majuli and floods caused by Siyang River at Jonai among others. Sonowal also stressed on the need to dredge the Brahmaputra River as its water carrying capacity has reduced over the years due to loss of depth and said the Water Resource Department would soon start dredging work, the release added.
