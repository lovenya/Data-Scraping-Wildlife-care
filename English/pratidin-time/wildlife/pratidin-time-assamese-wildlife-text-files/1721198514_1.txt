An FIR has been lodged against Assam Tourism Minister Chandan Brahma and 12 other government officers by  naturalist Dilip Nath in Dhekiajuli, Sonitpur. While addressing a public gathering at the Batasipur Milan High School under Dekhiajuli, Brahma allegedly stated that the encroachers will be given land patta. Brahma's statement has incited the local indigenous people of the region. The local residents said authorizing encroachment in Sonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary is against the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Nath said, "This is a conspiracy of the BJP government. For the sake of the vote bank policy, the BJP government is misusing their power and violating the Forest Act. So I have filed a complaint against 12 bureaucrats and tourism minister," Nath said that the district level, Forest Rights Committees (FRC) have been verifying land documents of the people following the amendment of the Forest Rights Act, 2006,  since 2009 to keep a tab on the encroachment and illegal occupation of forest lands. However, the Deputy Commissioner since August this year has started a re-evaluation of the proceedings. (Featured image:Government of Assam)
