As many as 44 anti-poaching camps in the Kaziranga national park in Assam have been inundated as a result of floods hitting the northeastern state. With the view of protecting both animal and human lives in the flood situation in Kaziranga, the Bokakhat sub-divisional magistrate imposed several restrictions including regulation of speed of vehicles on the stretch of road on NH 37 starting from Panbari animal corridor to the district/sub-divisional western boundary near Bagori.
