In days whenglobal warming has been increasing day by day, here is a need to create numbersof man-made forests with the already existing two numbers of such forests inAssam, the Bhairabkunda forest in Udalguri district and the other Molai forestin Jorhat district. The sandyforest land in Bhairabkunda has been created in effort for long term conservationamid the gloom of large scale deforestation in Assam by villagers of sixvillages. This community initiative has been taken under Joint ForestManagement (JFM) with the regenerated forest expanse of 5500 bigha alreadyemerging as a shelter of wild animals and birds. On the otherhand, Jadav Payeng who is popularly known as the forest man of Assam hasplanted and tended trees on a sandbar of the River Brahmaputra turning it intoa forest reserve. The forest which is called Molai forest named after him islocated near Kokilamukh in Jorhat which encompasses an area of about 1360acres/550 hectares of land. the existingreserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries are being occupied by the people forwhich the animals don't get food and place to live in but the forest created byPayeng houses Bengal Tigers, Indian rhinocerous and over 100 deer and rabbits. Itis also home to monkeys and several varieties of birds including a large numberof vultures. There are several thousand trees including valcol arjun(Terminalia Arjuna), ejar (Lagerstroemia Speciosa), goldmohur (Delonix Regia),Koroi (Albizia procera), moj (Archidendron begeminum) and himolu (BombaxCeiba). Bamboo covers an area over 300 hectares. Moreover, aherd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year andgenerally stay for around six months and they gave birth to 10 calves in theforest in recent years. Deforestationis increasing day by day and to avoid global warming, we need more forests madeby man. Instead of cutting trees, we need to plant more and more saplings inorder to create a pollution free environment.
