It is important to always research the place thoroughly. In some places, you cannot cook. So in those places, you have to carry pre-cooked food with you. It is very important not to offend the local tribes while going for picnics. Be kind to them. You can also choose to respectfully give away excess food to them before you go. It is very likely to find dustbins kept by the local committees. Use them. To be on the safe side, carry waste bags with you to avoid littering. It is best to carry enough drinking and cooking water with you, instead of relying on the water bodies nearby. If you want to get inside the water, be extra careful. The water currents are usually very strong and it is difficult even for experienced swimmers to go upstream. Lastly, we hope you have a great time with your family and friends.
