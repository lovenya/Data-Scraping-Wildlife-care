Nestled partly in Assam’s Golaghat and Nagaon districts, the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve is a mesmerizing tapestry of biodiversity and ecological wonders. Renowned as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a sanctuary for the iconic Indian one-horned rhinoceros and the majestic Bengal tiger, Kaziranga holds a place of pride in the realm of wildlife conservation. However, despite its conservation efforts, Kaziranga faces a number of challenges including effectively managing poaching incidents and implementing systematic continuous monitoring processes. There are considerable issues of failing record-keeping and inadequate monitoring which have a detrimental impact on the park's wildlife. For the year 2023, the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun and National Tiger Conservation Authority, GOI, prepared a report titled - “Kaziranga Tiger Reserve Management Effectiveness Evaluation of Tiger Reserves in India, 2023” - where they highlighted the very issue of record-keeping and the lack of a centralized database. Lack of Centralized Database: One of the primary obstacles in managing poaching incidents at Kaziranga National Park is the lack of a centralized and comprehensive database. Until recently, the park relied on fragmented and manual record-keeping methods, leading to inefficiencies in gathering and analyzing poaching-related data. Without a unified database, the park authorities struggled to understand the scale and patterns of poaching, hindering their ability to devise effective strategies against illegal activities. Inadequate reporting: Another major issue contributing to the failing record-keeping is the underreporting and incomplete documentation of poaching incidents. Many incidents go unreported due to fear of reprisals from poachers, lack of awareness among local communities, or mistrust in the park's authorities. Furthermore, insufficient documentation of incidents hampers the investigation process, making it difficult to build strong cases against poachers and their networks. Decimation of information: Now there are certain official Whatsapp groups of park authorities that they use for decimation of information. The Whatsapp groups, which inter alia allocates night patrolling duties, although very effective does not translate into record keeping for future tactical and strategic use. Most of the information stays in the group and often doesn’t reach its desired destination (official records). Resource Constraints: Implementing systematic continuous monitoring requires significant financial and technological resources. However, Kaziranga National Park has struggled with budgetary constraints, limiting its ability to acquire and maintain state-of-the-art monitoring equipment and technology. Inadequate funding affects the installation and maintenance of camera traps, drones, and satellite-based surveillance systems, which are crucial for real-time monitoring and rapid response to potential threats. Technological Gaps: Inadequate technical expertise and training among park staff have also posed challenges in adopting and effectively using monitoring technologies. Without a well-trained workforce capable of handling advanced monitoring tools, the potential benefits of these technologies are not fully realized. This situation further contributes to the park's vulnerability to poaching incidents and illegal activities. Decline in Wildlife Population: The failure to keep accurate records of poaching incidents and the lack of systematic continuous monitoring can lead to a decline in the park's wildlife population. Poaching not only affects the targeted species, such as rhinoceros and tigers, but also disrupts the delicate ecological balance, impacting other flora and fauna. Erosion of Public Trust: The inability to effectively manage and address poaching incidents erodes public trust in the park's conservation efforts. Local communities play a critical role in safeguarding the park's resources, and their trust and cooperation are essential in mitigating poaching threats. When incidents are not adequately documented or addressed, it creates skepticism among local communities regarding the park's commitment to protecting their natural heritage. The need for an institutional mechanism to compile and utilize anti-poaching data The absence of an institutional mechanism to compile relevant data generated through anti-poaching camp duty registers, wireless radio, patrolling registers, and other sources is a major weakness in its management. This lack of a centralized data compilation system hampers effective conservation strategies, impedes informed decision-making, and limits the park's ability to combat poaching threats effectively.
