APDCL requests our esteemed consumers to observe the “EARTH HOUR” on 23rd March, 2024 Saturday by Switching Off the *non-essential lights* from 8:30PM to 9:30PM as a support to WWF-INDIA. Earth Hour, organized by World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is a global grassroots movement uniting people to take action on environmental issues and protect the planet. It takes place annually when individuals, communities, businesses, and governments around the world turn off non-essential lights for one hour from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. local time. Earth Hour serves as a poignant reminder of the urgent need to address climate change and other environmental challenges facing our planet. By dimming the lights, participants demonstrate their willingness to take action and reduce their carbon footprint. However, Earth Hour is not merely about turning off lights; it's about sparking conversations, inspiring sustainable actions, and advocating for policy changes to protect the environment.
