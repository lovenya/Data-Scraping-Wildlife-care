The term "state symbol" is used to describe an icon or other visual representation of a state that is meant to inspire pride and unity among its citizens. A national or state emblem represents the combined might of its people, traditions, and industries. The red panda is the state animal of Sikkim. This elusive animal populates the Darjeeling and Kalimpong regions of the West Bengal state in India, as well as the neighboring state of Sikkim. Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 provides the red panda with the highest level of protection possible because it is listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.
