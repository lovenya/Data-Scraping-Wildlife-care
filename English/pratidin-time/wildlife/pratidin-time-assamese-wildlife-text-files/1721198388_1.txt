Additional chief secretary of the Forest and Environment Department Rajiv Kumar Gupta said the state government has ordered an inquiry which would be conducted by the principal chief conservator of forest (wildllife). "Primary information shows that eight deaths have occurred due to infighting. For the rest three, postmortem reports are awaited," Gupta added. Speaking to the media, PCCF wildlife AK Saxena, who rushed to the Gir forest, said that most of the deaths are due to infighting and resultant injuries. "Most of the deaths are due to infighting and injuries caused thereby, mainly affecting cubs and females. This trend is being noticed over a period of three to four years. No foul play or suspicion is suspected," said Saxena. Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani said on Thursday that a probe must be conducted to see the cause for the deaths.
