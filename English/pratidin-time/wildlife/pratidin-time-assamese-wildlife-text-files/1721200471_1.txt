May Bharat’s wildlife thrive… pic.twitter.com/aasusRiXtG Last week, a cheetah translocated from Namibia, died at Kuno National Park. So far, seven adult cheetahs and three cubs born in India have died since March 2023. In May 2023, the Supreme Court voiced concern over the death of the big cats and asked the Union government to file a detailed affidavit explaining the reasons behind the deaths and remedial measures taken to prevent the deaths.
