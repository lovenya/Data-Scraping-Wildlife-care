A picture posted by 'santuaryasia' on Instagram has gone viral as a tiger was spotted in Mizoram's Dampa Tiger Reserve Santuary after nearly seven years! The last time a big cat was spotted was back in 2014. The caption of the picture reads, ""Don't scroll past, you're looking at a historic image! The first photographic record of a tiger in Mizoram's Dampa Tiger Reserve in seven years!" wrote Sanctuary Asia while sharing the image on Instagram. "Can't see it? Look a little closer, and leave a comment when you find it," The viral picture shows a black and white image, what appears to be a dense forest area, but, if looked closely, a pair of eyes can be seen staring at you. The image has accumulated over 5000 likes and hundreds of comments since it was posted on Tuesday. Some of the comments read – "Found it! That's some insane camouflage! Left border middle section.. Stripes and eyes barely visible," an Instagram user wrote. "Lovely. It took me almost 20-25 seconds to spot the tiger," said another. "I  cant see it inspite of the pointers!," said another instagram user who couldn't spot it. Several Instagram users congratulated the forest guard for the capture as it was the first sighting of a tiger in seven years in the santuary. The picture was taken by a camara trap placed by forest guard and veteran conservationist Zakhuma Don, who has been patrolling the Dampa forests since many years. In February, he set up a camara trap and retrieved it three months later in May. While going through the images it had captured, he found the image of the tiger and sent it to authorities for confirmation. "Wildlife Institute of India's Department of Endangered Species Management ultimately confirmed that Zakhuma has indeed photographed a tiger in Dampa," wrote Sanctuary Asia.
