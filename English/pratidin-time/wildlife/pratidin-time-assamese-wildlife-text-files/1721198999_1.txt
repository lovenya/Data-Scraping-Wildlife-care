A trained dog squad in Assam, billed as the first of its kind in the country, is helping to track poachers in the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries of the state and assist forest security personnel in their conservation efforts, said a PTI report. 

The nation's first dog squad for wildlife crimes was set up in Assam under the initiative of biodiversity organization Aaranyak' in 2011 with one male Belgian Malinois named Zorba.

The dog squad known as the 'K9 unit' has over the years evolved into a 'very efficient and well-trained one" in tracking down wildlife crimes, said Bibhab Talukdar, the secretary general of the body which has undertaken the effort as quoted by PTI.
