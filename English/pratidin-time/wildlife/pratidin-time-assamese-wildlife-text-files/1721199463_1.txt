Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has dismissed allegations by activists that he along with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev broke the wildlife protection law by entering the Kaziranga National Park for a night safari. "There is no violation. According to wildlife law, the warden can give permission to enter a protected area even at night. No law stops people from entering at night. Yesterday, we had the formal opening of the park for this season and now Sadhguru and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar have arrived. Since they have lakhs of followers, this time we expect the tourist season will be very good for Kaziranga," Sarma told reporters on Sunday night.
