After the imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedures (CrPC) in Kaliabor in a bid to prohibit community fishing activities during the time of Bhogali Bihu at water bodies in and around the Kaziranga National Park, similar prohibitory measures were introduced in Biswanath and Golaghat districts of Assam on Friday. Golaghat district magistrate Dr P Uday Praveen issued orders prohibiting "Illegal entry and community fishing in beels, rivers and wetland in the Kaziranga National Park under Golaghat district with immediate effect". In the order, the district magistrate mentioned that any violation will draw action under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The order mentioned that the prohibitory measures were introduced after witnessing a growing trend of people in large numbers entering the Kaziranga National Park for community fishing from different parts of the state during Magh Bihu for the last few years. This leads to "disturbance of the sanctity of the National Park and may lead to possible law and order situation. Moreover, with overcrowding of people on national highway 715, traffic congestion is also likely to take place, in view of which the orders were issued. However, anyone feeling aggrieved by the order may approach the district magistrate with a just cause and in writing to seek an exemption from or to either recind, alter or modify the order, it added. The order read, "Whereas, the letter received from the Divisional Forest Officer, Eastern Assam Wildlife Division, Bokakhat vide Letter No. B/WLG/Illegalities/2024/275-79, Date: 10.01.2024 regarding promulgation of prohibitory order U/S 144 Cr.P.C."
