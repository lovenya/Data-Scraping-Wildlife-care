In a rare sight, a white hog deer has been spotted in Kaziranga National Park creating an interest among wildlife conservationists and enthusiasts to visit the heritage site to catch a glance of the animal. Based on information received by local residents, nature and wildlife photographer Jayanta Kumar Sarma captured the white deer through his lens in the Burapahar Range. As per a PTI report, the animal was spotted at grassland on Monday last near the 12 line area of Amguri Tea Estate under the Kaliabor sub-division in Nagaon. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) of Kaziranga National Park (KNP) Ramesh Gogoi said to the agency that this particular white deer was seen for the first time and sometimes comes out of the park and wanders with other brown deer to feed on grass, he said. The white colour of the deer is a purely genetic matter, caused due to mutation of the gene, and it is not a different species of the deer family, the DFO said. Out of the total 40,000 hog deer in Kaziranga, one or two such kinds of uncommon white hog deer can be found, Gogoi added.
