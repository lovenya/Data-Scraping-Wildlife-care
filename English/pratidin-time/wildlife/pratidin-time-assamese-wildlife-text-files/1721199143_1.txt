Assam is a state enriched with rich flora and fauna. The state has scripted a success story in the world's rhino conservation landscape as the Rhinoceros unicornis species or one-horned rhinoceros found in Assam's National Parks are well protected. This species was once a severe victim of poaching in the state as the rhino population started dwindling.
