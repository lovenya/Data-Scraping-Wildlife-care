Tiger is an incredible part of the nature, wildlife is India's natural wealth and it is praise worthy that India has 70 percent of world's tiger population, this increased number of the big cats in India reflects equilibrium in the nature, said the Union Environment Minister, Prakash Javadekar at the release of the detailed report of Tiger Census on the eve of Global Tiger Day in New Delhi on Tuesday. Javadekar said, "Tigers and other wild life are a kind of soft power India has to show on the international front", adding, "Despite several constraints such as less land mass, India has eight percent of bio-diversity because our country has a culture of saving and preserving the nature, trees and its wild life". India is tirelessly working with all 13 tiger range countries towards nurturing the tiger and the minister announced that his Ministry is working on a programme in which efforts would be made to provide water and fodder to animals in the forest itself to deal with the challenge of human-animal conflict which is causing deaths of animals. The detailed report released today assesses the status of tigers in terms of spatial occupancy and density of individual populations across India. The report evaluates the status of habitat corridors connecting major tiger populations and highlights vulnerable areas that require conservation attention for each landscape.It also provides information on major carnivores and ungulates regarding their distribution and relative abundance.
