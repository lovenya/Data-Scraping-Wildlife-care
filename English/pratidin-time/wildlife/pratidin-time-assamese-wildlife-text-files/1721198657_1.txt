Unfortunately, due to the influx of tourists, the health of the root bridge has suffered. However, it remains a symbol of pride for Meghalaya, as evidenced by its presentation at the 70th Republic Day ceremony. In order to showcase the impressive craft of building bridges from secondary roots, a replica of the bridge has been constructed in Nangrighat, Cherrapunji. The living root bridges, grown from rubber trees, take around 25 years to mature and can carry the weight of 50 people, operating for an impressive 500 years. These bridges are even honored as the "Tajmahal of Meghalaya." As the roots grow stronger, the bridge becomes even more robust, making them truly unique and remarkable structures.
