A stupa located in Gangtok, Do Drul Chorten is one of the largest stupas in Sikkim and is surrounded by 108 prayer wheels. Drul Chorten, also known as Druk Chorten or Bhutanese stupa, is a type of religious monument found in Bhutan. It is a form of Buddhist architecture that is primarily used for meditation and prayer.

They are usually adorned with colorful prayer flags and feature a small door or entrance way that leads to a sacred chamber containing religious artefacts and offerings.
