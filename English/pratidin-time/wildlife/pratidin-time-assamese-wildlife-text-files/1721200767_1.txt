It has an area of 40 km2 (15 sq mi) and is crucial to the functioning of the ecosystem in Loktak Lake. In this region, biomasses, also known as phumdis, are so prevalent that they completely cover a large area. These phumdis, typical of a swamp marsh, are composed of decomposed organic matter, biomass, and compacted soil. Although there is still water beneath the phumdis, they are sturdy enough for animals and humans to walk on. There's a good chance you'll see the 'rings' of Loktak Lake fame. All of these share the same formation process. This park is also unique because it is the only known habitat of the Sangai deer, a species of deer that is critically endangered.
