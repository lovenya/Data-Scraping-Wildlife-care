Assam's Dima Hasao is all set to get its first and state's sixth national park. According to reports the proposed park will cover a protected area of Simleng River Impenetrable National Park of 100 square kilometre area and will form a large contiguous conservation belt together with the adjacent Borail Wildlife Sanctuary of Cachar district and the Nampuh Wildlife Sanctuary of the bordering state of Meghalaya. A proposal for the same has already been submitted by the Dima Hasao forest authorities to the North Cachar Hills (Dima Hasao) Autonomous Council for the creation of the park. Dima Hasao being the greenest district of Assam with over 80 per cent forests cover, the district, however, does not have a single wildlife sanctuaries or a national parks and this has adversely affected the district's wildlife conservation. On formal inauguration, this will be Assam's sixth national park after Kaziranga, Manas, Dibru-Saikhowa and Orang.
