Here are some places to visit in Sikkim: Sikkim's capital city, Gangtok, is situated at an elevation of 5,500 feet in the eastern Himalayan mountain range. This charming city is the ideal fusion of modernity and traditional Sikkimese culture. Gangtok offers a unique combination of breathtaking natural beauty, extensive cultural history, and contemporary comforts. Visitors can enjoy panoramic views of snow-capped mountains, lush green valleys, and crystal-clear waterfalls, all while indulging in the bustling city's delicious local cuisine and lively markets. The city boasts an array of tourist attractions, including the Enchey Monastery, the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, and the Tashi Viewpoint. Adventure enthusiasts can explore nearby trekking trails, paragliding spots, and river rafting facilities. Gangtok is also the gateway to the famous Nathu La Pass, Lachung, and Pelling, making it a popular tourist destination. Overall, Gangtok is a mesmerizing blend of culture, adventure, and natural beauty, making it a must-visit destination for any traveler. Tsomgo Lake  The glacial lake Tsomgo Lake, also called Tsongmo Lake or Changu Lake, is located 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Gangtok, the state's capital. The lake, which is 3,753 meters (12,313 feet) above sea level, turns into a winter wonderland. The local Sikkimese people hold great respect for the lake's reflective surface, which dazzles with a rainbow of colors that change with the seasons. Buddhist monks have even been known to predict the future based on the lake's shifting hues. After the winter has passed, by mid-May, the lake's edge is alive with the colorful blooms of rhododendrons (Sikkim's state tree), primulas, blue and yellow poppies, irises, and other floral species. Among the many wildlife species that can be seen close to the lake are brahminy ducks and red pandas. A variety of tourist activities are available for lake visitors, including rides on decorated yaks and mules and a variety of food and drink options sold at kiosks. Additionally, a tiny Shiva temple can be found on the lake's edge. As the lake is situated in a restricted area, all Indian visitors must obtain permits, and foreign nationals must have a special permit. Yumthang Valley, in the north of Sikkim at an elevation of 3,564 meters, is a stunningly beautiful and well-visited tourist destination. It is known as the 'valley of flowers' because it is situated above the altitude line, where trees do not grow. The fragrant air, the vast stretches of flowery meadows, and the shrubby slopes of the valley all combine to create a natural paradise that draws many people from all over the world. Views of the Panhunri and Shundu Tsenpa peaks provide a stunning backdrop for the gushing Teesta river in Yumthang Valley. Visitors can see yaks grazing amongst a stunning selection of Rhododendrons and other Himalayan flowers. Due to its high altitude, Yumthang Valley is not a good place to visit in the winter or during the wet season; the best time to go is during the summer months of April and May. Pelling, a picturesque town in Sikkim's West district, has overtaken Gangtok as the state's second-most-visited attraction. It is 130 kilometers from Gangtok and is only 10 kilometers from Geyzing, and is well-known for its breathtaking panorama of Khangchendzonga and the neighboring mountains. In fact, the famous Pemayangste monastery, one of Pelling's main draws, is less than a kilometer away.

The monastery was built in the 16th century and was renovated in the 20th century to its current grandeur. Ravangla is a charming and tranquil small town perched at an elevation of 7,000 feet and located just 25 kilometers from Namchi, the capital of South Sikkim. Ravangla charms visitors with its simplicity, tranquility, and unimpeded views of the majestic snowy peaks that stand as sentinels to the north. The simplicity, tranquility, and unobstructed views of the majestic snowy peaks serve as sentinels to the north. While Ravangla sits between two of Sikkim's primary attractions, Gangtok and Pelling, it possesses a distinct character of its own. Serenity is the hallmark of Ravangla, and while there is not much to do in the town itself aside from browsing the local market for souvenirs and essential goods, there are several fascinating sites within easy reach by car. Two renowned monasteries, Bonn and Ralong, are located near Ravangla, and Kewzing boasts a historic marketplace and enigmatic caves on its outskirts. Visitors can also opt for short trekking excursions to nearby Lepcha villages like Yangang, Tinkitam, and Kewzing. East Sikkim's charming little hamlet of Dzuluk, Zuluk, Jhuluk, or Jaluk, which is located at an elevation of roughly 10,000 feet (3,000 m), is tucked away in the lower Himalayas. Due to its breathtaking views of the eastern Himalayan mountain range, which includes the magnificent Kanchenjunga, this unusual location is growing in popularity as a new tourist destination. Dzuluk once served as a stopover on the ancient Silk Route, which connected Kalimpong in India with Lhasa in Tibet. Before passing through the Jelep-la pass, traders heading to Tibet would frequently use Dzuluk, among other locations, as an overnight base. The Silk Route, however, lost its importance and stopped being used after China invaded Tibet. Today, Dzuluk is a treasure waiting to be discovered by daring tourists looking for an experience off the beaten path.
