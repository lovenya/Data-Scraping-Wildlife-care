The Assam Forest Department has been accused of failing to provide "factual reports" on the population census of one-horned rhinos conducted in the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Wildlife Wing of @assamforest remains strangely silent and aloof to the Central Governmentâ€™s directives. Reports sought by the @moefcc and the @ntca_india on Rhino census in @kaziranga_ are NOT sent. Silently covering up the tracks and burying information? @byadavbjp @cmpatowary pic.twitter.com/5ND9ySvTYl The Ministry had sought a report from the CWLW on February 19, 2023, but according to Choudhury, the wildlife wing of the Assam Forest Department has not adhered to the central government's directives. Choudhury further alleged that the rhino population estimation in the Kaziranga National Park in 2022 was inflated by manipulating survey data sheets.
