Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday released eight cheetahs into Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh on the occasion of his 72nd birthday. In 1952, cheetahs were declared extinct from India but today 8 cheetahs (5 females and 3 males) were brought from Africa's Namibia as part of 'Project Cheetah' and the government's efforts to revitalise and diversify the country's wildlife and habitat.
