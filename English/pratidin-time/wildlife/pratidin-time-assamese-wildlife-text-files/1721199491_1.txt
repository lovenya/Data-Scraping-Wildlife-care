The devastating flood situation triggered due to heavy rains has posed a serious threat to the wildlife of the Orang National Park. Due to the floodwaters of Brahmaputra 70% of the park has inundated. The forest camps have submerged too. The national park is situated on the north banks of Brahmaputra within the Darrang and Sonitpur district. The park officials have rescued the animals and have shifted them to higher altitude locations of the park. So far, there have been no reported deaths of any animals. The Orang National Park is home to the one-horned rhinoceros, Bengal tiger, Asiatic elephants, and the endangered pygmy hog among others.
