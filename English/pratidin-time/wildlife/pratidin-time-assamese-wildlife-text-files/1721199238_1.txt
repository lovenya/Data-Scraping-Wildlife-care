The Indian National Congress (INC) has started an onlinecampaign to stop coal mining in Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, Assam and itaims to spread awareness about the future of the wildlife sanctuary through"social media movement." Along with PSUs, BJP has also put our rich natural resources on sale. #SaveDehingPatkai pic.twitter.com/i2euyhayc8 The NationalBoard for Wildlife, or NBWL, permitted Coal India Limited to carry outextraction in 98.59 hectares of the rainforest's land. Stop open coal mining at Dehing Patkai.
Save the amazon of the North East.#SaveDehingPatkai pic.twitter.com/ablibKbunH Many fearthat it will completely destroy Dehing Patkai, which is also known as 'Amazonof the East.' We haven't forgotten how #महाराष्ट्रदोहीBJP was hellbent on destroying Aarey forest for its evil plans.

Now they are doing this in Assam's Dehing Patkai rainforest. Such incessant damage to nature contributes to pandemics.

Doesn't the BJP understand?#SaveDehingPatkai pic.twitter.com/A79UYFfXXh DehingPatkai Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the Dibrugarh and Tinsukia Districts ofAssam and covers an area of 111.19 km² rainforest. It is part of the Assamvalley tropical wet evergreen forest and consists of three parts: Jeypore,upper Dihing River and Dirok rainforest. BJP's move to carry out coal mining in Dehing Patkai elephant reserve in Upper Assam will be an assault on 'Amazon of the East'.

We strongly oppose this mindless act of selling our natural resources by the BJP to its cronies. We shall fight it tooth and nail.#SaveDehingPatkai pic.twitter.com/1jeRAL0GjQ
