As part of Indian Railways' policy to protect wildlife species, including rare and endangered ones, the Northeast Frontier Railway (N. F. Railway) is implementing measures to safeguard the Hollock Gibbon in Assam. The railway line passing through the Gibbon Sanctuary in Jorhat district, home to the rare and arboreal Hollock Gibbon, poses a significant risk to these animals. In response, N. F. Railway, in consultation with the Assam State Forest Department, Wildlife Institute of India, and other stakeholders, has decided to install Canopy Bridges inside the sanctuary. Details of the Initiative ·         Canopy Bridges Installation: The bridges will be installed at several identified points to facilitate the easy movement of arboreal species across the railway track that bifurcates the sanctuary. The Assam State Forest Department has already submitted the design and estimate for the installation of these bridges, which was prepared by the Wildlife Institute of India in consultation with N. F. Railway. This initiative underscores N. F. Railway's commitment to wildlife conservation. In collaboration with state forest departments and other relevant organizations, N. F. Railway is taking necessary steps to protect endangered species and prevent their extinction at every possible location where railway lines intersect with wildlife habitats.
