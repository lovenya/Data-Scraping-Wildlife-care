Three middlemen have been arrested in the city for attempting to sell deer antlers or horns procured from unknown forest sources at Rs 5 lakh, an official said on Friday. 

“To lure the customers, the accused (Sundaresh, Manjunath and Raghavendra ) made a video about the antlers and said that grinding a small part of the antler into powder and drinking it with water will heal ailments and their mere presence would bring luck and so on,” said Central Crime Branch (CCB) DCP Kuldeep Jain. 

A case has been registered against all the three under the Wildlife Act
