About Ambergris
Ambergris is known as the treasure of the sea. A product of sperm whales, the solid waxy substance is used to manufacture perfumes of the premium range. The brown coloured substance is produced inside the abdomen of sperm whales. Whales come under Schedule 2 of the Wildlife Protection Act and it is illegal to possess or trade any of its by-products in the country.
