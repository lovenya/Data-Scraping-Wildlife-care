Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre announced on Wednesday that a high-level committee had been formed to create public awareness and submit a comprehensive report on the measures to be taken to prevent the sale of products and articles made from body parts of wild animals, including tiger claws, tiger teeth, etc.

The committee will be headed by the Deputy Principal Chief Conservator of Forests-APCCF (Wildlife), Karnataka Forest Department. The Minister informed that a clear instruction regarding the same has been issued to the Deputy Chief Secretary of the department in this regard.

“The committee has been directed to submit a comprehensive report on the number of cases registered for possession of articles made from body parts of wild animals under the Wildlife Protection Act. The report will also include action taken in cases registered under such offences. The report will be submitted within a week,” said Khandre.

The announcement came in the wake of the arrest of Bigg Boss Kannada season 10 contestant Varthur Santosh for allegedly wearing a tiger claw pendant. Santosh was arrested by the forest officials a couple of days ago. However, after the incident, the department received many complaints with photos of film actors and politicians wearing similar pendants. There is a growing demand for action to be taken against the offenders.

“All are equal before the law. Under the Wildlife Protection Act, it is an offence to possess articles made up of body parts of wild animals. The department will thoroughly investigate any such complaints,” added Khandre.
