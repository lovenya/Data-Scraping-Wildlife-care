As police bust what is suspected to be splinters of an interstate gang, we take a look at some notorious gangs that have used unique modus operandi to spread their tentacles in the city

The recent arrest of 14 accused, suspected to be a part of interstate gang operating from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, has baffled the city police. While several notorious attention diversion gangs such as Ojikuppam gang from Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, Ramjinagar from Trichy in Tamil Nadu and the infamous Irani and Bhawariya gangs from Maharashtra, operate in the city, these gangs have been lying low ever since the pandemic struck.
 
Police wonders if the recently arrested persons are from splinters of the infamous gangs.
 
The going got tough for most gangs as their all-time favourite striking spot — banks — are now allowing only a limited number of people and that too in queues maintaining social distancing. Security staff are everywhere and very few people are actually coming out of their homes to conduct transactions at banks so the vulnerable victims who would fallen for their attention diversion tactics are hard to come by. Police sources said the gang members would be exploring other avenues in crime.

The Sadduguntepalya
 
police and the Mico Layout police arrested three persons who broke into houses in Southeast Bengaluru and made away with gold ornaments weighing 1.21 kg worth Rs 58 lakh in total. With the arrest they had cracked 16 cases among the two police jurisdictions. Along with these three house break thef offenders, 11 other accused involved in drug peddling, two-wheeler thefts, counterfeit notes, and also wildlife crimes were arrested and the cops made a massive recovery of stolen property worth Rs 7.81 crore.

During interrogation of some of the accused parties, the cops learnt that the accused had links with people at certain pockets in North Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh and usually come to the city to commit crimes and leave immediately soon after they are finished.

This reminded them of the notorious gangs from Ojikuppam, Ramjinagar, Bhawariya, and of the Irani gangs who used to come in flights to the city, commit crimes of attention diversion and then make away with booty worth lakhs. Allow us to jog your memory about these gangs.

Ojikuppam Gang

Originally from Kuppam in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, members of this gang are trained thieves with unbelievable attention diversion tactics. “Even children from their community are given training on how to use a fraction of second to hoodwink a victim and make away with the booty. They are also trained on how to refrain from spilling the beans, if they are caught, at least for three to four days to give time for the others to flee the city, district or state. Even women and children are part of these gangs who target customers in and around banks,” said a police officer. Modus operandi: A group of six to seven people enters a bank. They drop currency notes of 10s, 50s or 100s, which catches a victim’s attention. They slowly move the money from one to the other and lure the victim to outside the bank. If that doesn’t work, they by puncture the target’s vehicle and follow them in to pretending to help them, but flee with their bag. Sometimes they use something to stain the victim’s clothes and draw their attention to the stain to flick their bag. Sometimes they throw a powder on the victim that can cause itching; other times point to some defect in the vehcile such as oil leak.
Several of the members have been arrested, but since the sections under IPC are cheating - 420 and theft - 380, they are bailable and the accused soon get back to what they are doing, police sources said.

Ramjinagar Gang

Members of the Ramjinagar belong mostly to Trichy’s Ramjinagar. Their targets are not bank customers, but the employees. They only target big money. They can also hunt for customers who withdraw large amounts of cash as members of their network are most of the time present inside banks that have no security personnel. These gang members come into the bank in groups of six to eight and one of them would cook up a story that he had forgotten to bring his cheque book and pretend to be in an emergency that a family member had taken ill and would want to withdraw some cash. The attention of the bank employees are diverted and the group makes away with cash that is in the drawers of the employees. In an incident that happened in January 2020, three gang members of Ramjinagar gang were nabbed by the customers at a bank when they were trying to run away with the money. However, a few group members escaped with Rs 1.34 lakh in cash, but Rs 2.84 lakh was recovered from the men who were caught by the customers at the Andhra Bank in Bharath Nagar in BEL Layout. 
However, the police are unable to act stringently against these gang members because there is not even one case that these gang members have never been involved in heinous crimes such as attacking anyone or robbing anyone by causing them hurt.

Irani and Bhawariya Gang

The Iranian and Bhawariya gang members work a bit differently. Most members of this gang are well built and wear Khakhi trousers to pose as policemen in mufti. They offer free advice to people who wear gold ornaments and stroll near their houses. The gang members approach the people and tell them that a robbery had taken place a few hours ago in the next street and ask the victim to remove the chain and keep it inside a piece of paper, put it in their bag or pocket and walk back home. They would also ask the person not to open it until they reach their house. After the victim reaches home and opens the packet, all that is left is a stone or stick and the jewellery is long gone. These gang members target elderly women who go for walks outside their houses in residential layouts. A gang members told the cops during interrogation that they were not interested in robbing people up North as everyone wears artificial gold, but in the South, almost everyone wears gold. So they frequent the city in flights, commit crimes and get back. They sometimes buy used bikes to commit crimes, and other times steal bikes. The bikes are dumped at parking lots of railway stations and bus stations before they flee. 
Police sources said each of these members had one of two receivers. If one receiver is caught, some of the booty is secured with the other receiver. The police in their village are hand-in-glove who tip them off if Bengaluru City police goes to their village to arrest them.

Mufti operations

The Irani gang members claim that they are descendants of people from Iran. They have set up camps at various locations including Bengaluru, Dharwad, Bidar and Pune. Earlier, they used to indulge in attention diversion cases but now they are focussing more on chain snatching. There have been instances where the gang members attack the cops if they are about to be apprehended. Their modus operandi is that they will first steal bikes and do a recce of the place before snatching chains in selected areas. There have been instances where the gang members introduce themselves as police in mufti who are trying to catch the chain snatchers. They too give out covers to gullible people to safeguard their valuables. Then, in the guise of testing the covers, they hand over the duplicate covers and escape from the scene. After chain snatchings, they try to escape to the neighbouring states.
Sources said that a 23-year-old chain snatcher had acquired the status of a numero uno chain snatcher. His 
popularity among the chain snatching community had soared so much that many of the families were vying with each other to offer him a bride. A few of the gang members are involved in sports though their past time remained chain snatching.
