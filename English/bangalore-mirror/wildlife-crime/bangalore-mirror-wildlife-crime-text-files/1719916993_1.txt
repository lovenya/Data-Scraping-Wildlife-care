High court staff got a few lessons on how to handle a snake as they encountered a rat snake for the fifth time in three months. 
 The snake rattled employees and advocates at the crime records room on Thursday, leading to an hour-long chaos till a BBMP wildlife volunteer arrived to rescue the rat snake. His revelation that rat snakes were non-venomous helped calm the people present.  
 And while at it, he also imparted a few lessons to them. 
 Given the regularity of the slithering visitors, Rajesh Kumar M, a BBMP wildlife volunteer, imparted some tips to handle the snakes.  
 “Snakes frequent the place since it is near Cubbon Park. So, we gave simple tips to the staff to keep cool on seeing snakes. Simple dos and don’ts will not only help the people but also the animals,” added Rajesh.
 
 
 The Dos
 Stay at least 5 feet away from the snake Make sure that children are kept at a safe distance and are under  watch Keep track of the snake’s movement Call the authorised snake-rescuer (Helpline No 9880108801) Keep the premises clean so that it does not attract snakes   
 The Don’ts Never attempt to chase or scare away the snake Do not bring sticks or fire near it as it may frighten the snake, prompting it to attack people Avoid any sudden movement while in front of it as it may agitate the snake
