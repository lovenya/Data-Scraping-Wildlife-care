The Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Bengaluru arrested two people on Thursday who were trying to sell a two-headed snake under the guise of being delivery boys for an online delivery service.

A case has been registered against them and a complaint has also been submitted to the Forest Officer of Kaggalipura range.

The accused, identified as Mohammad Rizwan and Azar Khan, were trying to sell the reptile at Rs 50 lakh.

"They were trying to sell a two-headed snake, belonging to the Boidae family commonly called Sand Boa, which is a specified reptile under schedule-four of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972," said Joint Commissioner of Police, Sandeep Patil.

The snake is reportedly used for medicinal purposes and it is believed to bring in good fortune.

Patil also said that while online delivery services are doing a good job of delivering essential items to people at their doorsteps, some people are misusing it for illegal activities.
