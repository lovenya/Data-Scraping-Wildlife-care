The City Crime Branch (CCB) police have arrested three persons trying to sell deer horns in the city on Monday. They seized 56 horns from the trio. The police suspect there is a big gang killing wild animals to make easy money.
 
 Based on a tip-off that some persons were selling deer horns, a police team rushed to Yeshwanthpur. At 5th main, they found a luggage autorickshaw parked in front of a factory. The police surrounded the vehicle and found three persons sitting in it along with as many as 56 horns in their possession. DCP HD Anand Kumar said they had arrested three men, Vinod D, 28, hailing from Davangere, Manjunatha, 31, from Hosur main road and Shekar, 35, from Nelamangala.
 
 The police seized the horns along with luggage auto and their mobile phones. The trio had bought the horns from villagers staying near a forest area in Shivamogga after paying them a small sum and came to the city to sell it, police said.
 
 Police are yet to ascertain the details of the people who hunt the deer and sell their skin and horns. They said it appeared to be a big racket, and forest officials had told them not to disclose the market price for the horns, as people may start killing more animals to make easy money.
 
 A case under the Wildlife Protection Act has been registered against the trio and further investigation is on.
