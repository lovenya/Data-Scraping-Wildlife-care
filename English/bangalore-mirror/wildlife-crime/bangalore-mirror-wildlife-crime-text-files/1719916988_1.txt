Residents and wildlife volunteers in and around the Bangalore University campus at Nagarbhavi stumbled on a number of illegally axed sandalwood trees, an incident which they hope will finally jolt forest officials out of their slumber.
 
 Illegal logging of sandalwood trees is rampant in the area and although residents have time and again alerted the forest department to the goings-on, little has been done to safeguard the trees. Hitherto, thieves restricted their loot to just two or three trees a week, but on Friday, residents found a stockpile of more than 25 trees, many of them full-grown. Residents believe the trunks were ready to be smuggled out and that they had stumbled on the trees in the nick of time. A forest guard has now been deployed to keep watch.
 
 “We were shocked to see the number of trees which had been axed and stocked,” said Deepak, a resident of Nagarbhavi. “The trees seem to have been cut last night (Thursday-Friday) and were ready to be transported. It’s shocking to see so many trees being cut with such impunity.”
 
 Felling a sandalwood tree without sanction from the forest department is a crime and attracts a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. The Jnanabharati campus is spread over 1.100 acres and residents claim that sandalwood trees are pinched with alarming regularity. 
 
 “The trees were cut with a powered-saw,” claimed Deepak, who is also a wildlife volunteer. “A minimum of three trees are cut in a week. This is the first time we have found so many trees cut at one go.” 
 
 The wood is transported to neighbouring states and oil is extracted. With a litre of oil commanding a price of Rs 1 lakh, it translates into a lucrative business.
 
 Forest officials promised stringent action against the guilty. “It’s illegal,” said S Kumaraswamy, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), Bangalore Urban. “We have begun an investigation and those found guilty will be dealt with severely.”
