Here's how you can help trace her. Add Karnataka Criminal Investigation Department's (CID) as your friend and tip off the sleuths. CID's Facebook username is 'Dgpcid Karnataka' and it joined Facebook on Monday.

Karnataka CID could probably be the first police organisation in India to join such social media. Police in USA and UK are already on Facebook and have reaped the benefits of social networking. CID Director General of Police Dr D V Guruprasad says the decision to join Facebook was taken after a presentation about the use of social media to improve police functioning at an interaction between the State police and the captains of IT/ITES industries in the city last month.

The DGP feels that joining the social networking site will bring about transparency in administration and also involve the community in policing. It will also help the public understand CID better.

CID's Facebook profile page will update the general public on a daily basis about the happenings in CID including the status of important cases being investigated by it. It will also invite tip-offs from the community to help the CID fight cyber crime, multi-level marketing frauds, narcotics smuggling, counterfeit currency; illegal storage and use of arms and explosives, human trafficking, wildlife crimes and other offences.
