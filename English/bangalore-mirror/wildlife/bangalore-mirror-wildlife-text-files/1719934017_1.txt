The Forest department, alarmed over the increasing number of trespassing incidents in the wildlife sanctuary, has banned people from entering the forest sans permission. According to officials from the department, thousands of people from Bangalore and other places started entering the protected forest area, thanks to rumours that the water dripping from the roots of a tamarind and a mango tree near the temple of Masthamma inside the forest, had healing properties.

“Thanks to these rumours, people have been flocking the forest in droves. The phenonmenon of the dripping water is nothing but the result of a pressure build-up in the underground water table and it’s a mere coincidence that both the trees are located at the same spot,” explained a senior official from the B R Hills division of the Forest department. The official added a precautionary note. He said that it’s dangerous for people to walk inside the forest as it’s a habitat for elephants, leopards, tigers and bears. Trespassers would be punished according to the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, he said.
