The police department has been barred from revealing the value of wildlife products seized from poachers. By letting out the market price of animal products – such as meat, skin, horn and tusk – poachers may only be getting encouraged, according to the state police chief.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Despite stringent laws and vigilance, poaching has remained a big concern for the wildlife department and the police. Endangered animals continue to be killed for their meat, skin, bones, and various other body parts.
 
 
 Since 1972, when the Wildlife Protection Act was established, it has been a practice during every raid and seizure to announce the value of the catch – for internal records and for the media. Wildlife activists now believe that by quoting the value, the department might inadvertently be encouraging poachers, who might find the trade lucrative.
 
 
 Sharath Babu R, honorary wildlife warden, Bengaluru, who was instrumental in bringing about this order, told Mirror: “We had requested the forest department, among others, not to allow the value of seized wildlife products to be announced. It only encourages criminals to kill more animals. This step by the state police chief is a really good one and should help reduce poaching.”
 
 
 Director-general and inspector-general of police Om Prakash’s order clearly stated that no officer or staff member should attach a value to wildlife products, put it up on the social media or give it to the press or public.
 
 
 Om Prakash said in his order that he understood the repercussions of attaching a value to such products, and how it was luring in more poachers who find the illegal trade lucrative.
