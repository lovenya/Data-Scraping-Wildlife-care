Forest department aims to examine well-being of elephants participating in Dasara festivities in Mysuru this year

For the first time, the forest department has introduced a ‘health card’ for elephants taking part in Dasara festivities. This measure aims to monitor the well-being of the elephants more closely. Additionally, a compulsory ‘pregnancy test’ for female elephants has been implemented for those participating in the 10-day festival starting on October 23, 2023.

Last year, during the Dasara celebrations, an elephant named Lakshmi gave birth to a male calf in the palace courtyard. This incident sparked outrage among wildlife enthusiasts, as bringing a pregnant elephant for training caused significant concern and widespread criticism of the forest department. In response to this, the forest department has taken several precautionary measures while selecting elephants for this year’s Dasara procession. These measures include comprehensive health inspections and the issuance of individual health cards for each elephant.

Dr Malathi Priya M, IFS, Chief Conservator of Forests, Mysuru circle, said, “The health card contains essential information such as the elephant’s name, age, weight, height, any existing diseases, and the status of its feet. For female elephants, the card also records their pregnancy status. This data will aid in ensuring the well-being of the elephants and preventing any unfortunate incidents during the festivities. The forest department team has already inspected nine elephants at the Mattigodu elephant camp, with inspections planned for the Ramapura, Dubare, and Bhimanakatte elephant camps. The finalised list of selected elephants will be released by the end of July.”

Furthermore, to avoid any unforeseen circumstances, pregnancy testing for female elephants has been made mandatory. Saswathi Mishra, APCCF (Elephant Project), has instructed the inclusion of blood and urine tests as part of the examination. This thorough inspection ensures that any health issues, including pregnancy, are identified if present within 90 days prior to the Dasara celebrations.

By implementing these measures and conducting meticulous health checks, the forest department aims to ensure the safety, and appropriate treatment of the elephants– Officials

“By implementing these measures and conducting meticulous health checks, the forest department aims to ensure the safety, well-being, and appropriate treatment of the elephants brought to participate in Dasara. This approach intends to avoid incidents like those experienced in the past and uphold the dignity and care of these majestic animals,” said officials.

Dasara will be inaugurated on October 15, and Jumbu Savari will be held on October 24. This time, apart from Jumbo Savari, there will be a torchlight parade and air show in Mysuru. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that necessary infrastructure should be provided to the tourists who will visit Mysuru on the occasion of Dasara. The CM has already met Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and has sought his ministry’s permission to hold an airshow at Mysuru in October.
