Karnataka’s famed wildlife activist Sanjay Gubbi won the annual Whitley Awards, dubbed as the ‘Green Oscars’, for his work in the field of animal conservation in India.
 
 Sanjay Gubbi won the award for his work to protect Karnataka’s tiger corridors. Gubbi, along with another Indian Purnima Barman, is among the six global winners of the award. Each of the winners received 35,000 pounds (USD 45,374) prize money for their projects.
 
 Gubbi had quit his job as an electrical engineer to work with nature and wildlife. In 2012, working closely with the Karnataka government, he secured the largest expansion of protected areas for the conservation of tigers in his state. “Karnataka is home to the highest number of tigers in India, and in 2015. Our aim is to take the numbers up to 100 over the next few years. This can only be possible through thorough participation of the community,” he said.
 
 With his award money, Gubbi hopes to reduce deforestation in two important wildlife sanctuaries which connect several protected areas and act as corridors for tigers, allowing them to move between territories.
 
 The community focus will be around the provision of fuel- efficient stoves to reduce the reliance on firewood collection from the habitat of the tigers and thus, save many lives in the process. “The awards are about recognising progress, winning those small battles which cumulatively equate to change at the national-level. In addition to the financial benefit of winning the award, winners receive professional communications training to turn scientists into ambassadors,” said Edward Whitley, founder of the Whitley Fund for Nature, which set up awards 24 years ago.
