Another female red panda is pregnant and is expected to give birth soon, zoo authorities said.

The three cubs were born on June 3 and June 20, Himalayan Zoological Park additional director Gut Lepcha said. The red panda figures in Schedule One of the Wildlife Protection Act because of its declining population both in the wild and in captivity. He said captive breeding had started with a pair of red pandas in 1999. Later two more red pandas rescued from the wild had joined the captive breeding programme.

“We are having good results of late. Last year two cubs were born,” Lepcha said, adding, “We also exchanged red pandas with the Darjeeling Zoological Park to prevent in-breeding.”

“Our zoo will have to take the initiative for breeding programme for these mammals, with the Darjeeling Zoological Park as the participating zoo. We have submitted a master plan last year to Central Zoo Authority to develop breeding centres, costing around Rs 29 crore,” said Lepcha.

The Himalayan Zoological Park is also the coordinating zoo for captive breeding of three other Himalayan wildlife species - Blood Pheasant, Himalayan tahr and blue sheep.
