Apropos the report With a leopard on the prowl, terror stalks families in IT corridor (Dec 9, BM), given the knowledge of wildlife among city-dwellers, the so-called leopard could actually turn out to be a tiger or even the extinct sabretooth! And hats off to our forest department for demanding photographic evidence of the animal sighted. It is time a neighbourhood ‘Spot the Big Cat’ contest is organised in the IT Corridor. Some IT company may consider sponsoring the committee. Anand Lashminarsu
