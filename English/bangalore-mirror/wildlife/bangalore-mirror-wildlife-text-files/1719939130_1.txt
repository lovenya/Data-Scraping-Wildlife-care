The Supreme Court on Friday said each protected forest - either national park or wildlife sanctuary - must have an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of minimum 1 km, where no permission should be given ti mining and other commercial activities as it made clear that mining in such areas will not be allowed. This was said by a bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai, and Aniruddha Bose.
