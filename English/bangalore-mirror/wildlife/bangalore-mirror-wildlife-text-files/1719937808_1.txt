In a shocking incident, a tusker was found shot in the middle of its head in the Kothanur range of the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka and its tusks were missing. Forest officials did not know about the incident until a month after the incident after people started sharing pictures of the dead elephant.

Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF), Ankaraj Hanur, said it was a 15-20-day-old carcass, which the forest staff found on February 4. “When the forest officers were patrolling the area, they found the carcass. It looked like it had been here from quite a while. The tusker was shot in the interiors of the forest area. We looked for the tusks but couldn’t find them as the poachers have already got them. We are on a look out for poachers,’ Hanur said.

When asked why it took so long for the forest officials to find the carcass, the official said that they were busy with the Chikkaluru Fair that was held between January 21-26. “All the forest staff were part of that festival and we didn’t conduct a check in the interior parts. We were checking on people who attended the festival whether they entered the area. But, unfortunately this happened,” Hanur said.

Wildlife activist Joseph Hoover pointed out that it was quite shocking for the forest officials to get to know an animal is shot or dead after close to a month. “Guns are easily available here in Kanakapura and Ramapura because of which poaching is a regular affair. The officials should first check into this. Also if the culprits are caught, they should not be bailed. In addition, it is the negligence of the forest officials since the incident occurred near the anti-poaching camp, which was about 5 km away from where the carcass was found,” said Hoover.
