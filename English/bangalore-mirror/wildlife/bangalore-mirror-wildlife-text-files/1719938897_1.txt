The Chennammanakere Achukattu police on Thursday cracked a wildlife poaching racket and arrested two persons who were trying to sell a crocodile hatchling to their customer. Based on a tip off, a team led by Inspector PR Janardhan, rushed to the spot near Eshwari theater and caught Abdul Khalid (32) from Jayanagar and his associate Gangadhar BS (32) from Kanakapura. The police recovered a plastic can containing the live hatchling.

The accused told the police they had poached the baby reptile from the banks of river Cauvery and brought it to the city after clinching a deal with the client who reportedly wanted to buy the reptile to keep it as a pet. The duo have been booked under various sections of the Wildlife Act and efforts are on to track down the client.
