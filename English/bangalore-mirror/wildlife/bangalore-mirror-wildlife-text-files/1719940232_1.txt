Bengaluru residents are urged to take precautions against rising young snake encounters 

As the monsoon rains bring flooding to various parts of Bengaluru, areas like Kalyan Nagar, Marathahalli, Nagarbhavi, and Banashankari are witnessing an increase in the presence of baby snakes. Among the most commonly encountered species are cobras, Russell’s vipers and sometimes even the common kraits, and saw-scaled vipers. The rescuers pointed out that this could be the hatching season and generally from May end to even until October, there is always an increase in the number of baby snakes found.

With the monsoon creating ideal hatching conditions and leading to baby snakes venturing into residential areas, the public needs to be aware of the risks and take necessary precautions. “Baby snakes, lacking the experience of their adult counterparts, can become defensive and strike if they feel threatened. On a single day, the rescuers are getting 5-6 rescue calls per day and the numbers are expected to rise.” said Mohan from BBMP wildlife warden.

Mohan highlighted a major issue: snakes frequently enter homes and shoes left outdoors while hunting for food. This problem worsens in areas with inadequate garbage disposal, as the trash attracts rats, subsequently drawing in snakes. Vacant lots strewn with waste further compound the problem by becoming breeding sites for these reptiles. Mohan recalled receiving a call from a city school on Wednesday, though the situation was swiftly resolved without causing panic, as the snake was promptly located.

Door’s open, slither right inA wildlife rescuer confirmed receiving multiple calls from rain-affected areas and shared experiences of rescuing numerous snakes, including Russel’s vipers and cobras, primarily from residential premises. 

According to the rescuers the female cobras, for instance, lay around 15-20 eggs. As the eggs hatch, the baby snakes begin their independent lives, often seeking shelter and food. The flooding and heavy rains force these young snakes out of their natural habitats and into human-populated areas. Their small size allows them to slip through small crevices and gaps, leading them into homes, gardens, and even shoes left outside. The rescuers pointed out that if one comes across a snake, it’s advisable to calmly move back and create distance. Then, promptly report the sighting to either the BBMP control room or the forest department. Snake rescuers strongly discourage individuals from attempting rescues independently, especially considering the growing trend of people trying to do so after watching online videos.

Few of the preventive measures

1. Keep Shoes Indoors: Snakes often hide in shoes left outside. So you can store your footwear inside or thoroughly check them before use.

2. Secure Garbage Disposal: Properly dispose of garbage to avoid attracting rats, which are a food source for snakes.

3. Maintain Clean Surroundings: Regularly clean and maintain yards, gardens, and surroundings to deter snakes from settling.

4. Seal Entry Points: Inspect and seal gaps, holes, and crevices in walls, doors, and windows to prevent snakes from entering homes.

5. Call Professionals: Never attempt to handle or capture snakes. Contact professional snake rescuers for safe and humane removal.
