Two incident of snake mishandling have been reported to the Forest department. A cobra was found in an apartment complex in Jakkur and a rat snake in an office compound near HAL. 

In both instances locals tried to deal with the snakes by themselves, using snake tongs, instead of contacting the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Forest cell or the Forest department.

Rajesh, a wildlife rescuer at the BBMP Forest cell, said, “Snakes are sensitive creatures with delicate backbones and when an inexperienced person uses a snake tong to handle it, the backbone can be easily broken. There is also a chance of getting bitten by the snake.”

Subash Malkede, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (AP-CCF), Karnataka said, “On sighting a snake, people should immediately contact BBMP Forest Cell or the Forest department as it is illegal for common people to handle snakes. If a person who has mishandled a snake is identified, legal action can be taken against them.”
