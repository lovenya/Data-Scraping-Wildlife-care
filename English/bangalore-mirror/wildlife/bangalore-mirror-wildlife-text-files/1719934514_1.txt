Where all can we find your footprints?
 I make it a point to travel at least twice a year, so my footprints have been all over the place. You can find them in Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania, New Zealand and the US..    Two things one should not forget while embarking on a trip... Easy – mosquito repellent and torch. I forgot both on my visit to Tanzania and Kenya. I especially regretted the torch for there is usually no power after 8 pm and one relies on the generator. And if you sleep in a tent in the dark and hear strange noises, believe me, you want that torch.
     The sights you recommend in these countries? Wildlife in Africa is a great sight. I went to Masai mara and Serengeti, which are part of the same plains separated by a river. Lots of wildlife to shoot (I mean with a camera, of course). The rainforest in Madagascar is awesome and the sightings of Lemur which is getting extinct. The glaciers of New Zealand’s South Island make a pretty sight as well.
     What can one expect to see in your first solo show? There are about 40 photographs that showcases wildlife and snapshots of the places that I have visited. Bangalore features in one photograph with a jazz concert scene. Mumbai's Necklace features too, but technically that’s a travel photograph for me. The proceeds from the exhibition will go to Mitra Jyothi, an organization that helps the visually impaired.     And I left Footprints Only is on at Opus till May 19
