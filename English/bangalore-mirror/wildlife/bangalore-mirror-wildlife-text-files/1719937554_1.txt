For the first time ever, an endemic South-Asian species of jumping spider, Hyllus semicupreus, has been discovered to feed on insect eggs. And this behaviour was discovered and put on record so quickly, thanks to social media.

Wildlife photographer and amateur naturalist AN Suresh Kumar came across a spider feeding on leaf-footed bug eggs (family Coreidae) on his farmland in Andhra Pradesh recently. Not realising that he had clicked a new behavior, he shared these photographs on the “Spiders of the Indian Subcontinent”, a specialist Facebook group, which focuses on the documentation, identification and study of Indian spiders. 

These photographs were spotted by arachnologist and researcher, Javed Ahmed. Realising the importance of this chance discovery, Ahmed encouraged the photographer to contribute his findings to science to facilitate a better understanding of spiders, which are severely understudied in India.

The discovery is significant as it can help in furthering biological means of pest control. The discovery has been published in the latest issue of ‘Peckhamia’, a peer-acclaimed international scientific journal dedicated to the study of jumping spiders. The study was collaborated with David E Hill, a world authority on jumping spiders.
