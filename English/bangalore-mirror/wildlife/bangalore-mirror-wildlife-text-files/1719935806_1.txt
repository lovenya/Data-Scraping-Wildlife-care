£7m private island mansion where Marilyn Monroe loved to party. It was first settled by English Colonists in 1651 and an antique cannon still sits angled out to sea 
 This luxury six-bedroom mansion on a private island has gone on the market for a whopping £7m. 

 	The Tudor-style house sits on a 3.5-acre private island which was once famous for glitzy showbiz soirees. 

 	Marilyn Monroe, Maureen O'Sullivan and Barbara Streisand are among the starlets who partied there in the 1950s and 60s. 

 	The Tavern Island, situated in the Long Island Sound, near Connecticut, overlooks New York City and boasts a private beach, a swimming pool, a docking area and landscaped gardens. 

 	The 6,100sq ft English Colonial Mansion, which was once owned by theatre legend Billy Rose, dates back to 1900. 

 	It's three stories and has a gym, two offices and a steam room. As well as the house, there's a two-bedroom cottage, a boat house and a Tea House. 

 	The island was first settled by English Colonists in 1651 and an antique canon still sits angled out to sea. 

 	The mainland is an hour's drive from Manhattan and on clear nights the island enjoys the bright lights of the city skyline. 

 	Sandy Falconer, a previous owner, spoke about the property to the New York Times in 1982. She told the newspaper: "Being out at sea away from the mainland seems to magnify everything - the changing of the seasons, the drama of the weather, the wildlife and even the colors." 

 	Tavern Island, which has changed hands at least twice since, is now being marketed by Christie's Real Estate company.
