The happy groom was four-year-old Yangyang, who it turns out is a bit of a toyboy (in chimpanzee years, at least), as his blushing bride Wanxing is six years old.

Admittedly, we don't actually know if she was blushing. We're not entirely sure how you'd tell if a chimpanzee was blushing.

 Do chimpanzees actually blush? Google isn't much help on this one.

The marriage was actually an arranged one - Yangyang, who was born in Guinea, moved to the wildlife park in Hefei, in eastern China's Anhui province after he was selected as being Wanxing's future hubby in 2009.
