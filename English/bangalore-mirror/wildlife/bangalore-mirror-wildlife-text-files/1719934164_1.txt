Kanchi, an 18-year-old elephant, is about to get its freedom back. Officials of the forest department have decided to cancel the No Objection Certificate (NOC) issued to Jadugar Anand to use the elephant in his magic shows. 
 
 The forest officials’ decision to set Kanchi free was prompted by a Bangalore Mirror report on the state principal conservator of forests (wildlife) and the magician drawing flak from wildlife experts and volunteers over the deal.
 
 Experts had maintained the NOC was issued in violation of both the recommendations of National Task Force for Wild and Captive Elephants and the Indian Wildlife Act, 1972, which restrict the use of captive elephants for commercial purposes. 
 
 “We have decided to initiate measures to withdraw the NOC,” said Kumar Pushkar, chief conservator of forests, Bangalore circle. “I have already directed my officials to send a report regarding this to higher authorities. We hope the NOC will be cancelled in a day or two.” 
 
 “We appreciate Pushkar’s swift action over the issue,” said Suparna Ganguly, a member of the National Task force for Wild and Captive Elephants. “The forest department officials should be more cautious in future before issuing such NOCs. They should examine basic aspects like to whom the NOC is to be given and for what purpose,” Ganguly said.
