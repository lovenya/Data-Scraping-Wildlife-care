Kamrup, Assam: A week-long operation to rescue a rhinocerous washed away in flood after it strayed from a sanctuary ended on Sunday and the pachyderm was put on a special truck to ferry it to a zoo.  The rhino was spotted on Sunday 20 km away in Uporhali Baghmari beel (waterbody) at Palasbari by locals who reported it to the authorities.
 
 Trained elephants were used to guide the stranded full grown one-horned rhino to a safe area before wildlife personnel tranquilised the two-tonne animal and put on the truck with stocks of fodder to transport it to Guwahati state zoo by road. 
   District Deputy Commissioner S K Roy said the earlier plan to airlift the rhino was dropped Sunday evening due to bad weather. 
   The Indian Air Force(IAF) had already carried out mock drills for airlifting the animal, which had strayed out of Pabitora sanctuary on September 29, by a chopper. 
   Officials said it was later thought it would be safer to bring the animal by road as the spot from where it was being transported is only around 45 km from Guwahati. 
   Inclement weather had prevented the translocation of the animal who was stranded in the sandbars of Brahamputra river at Sualkuchi in Kamrup district on September 29.
