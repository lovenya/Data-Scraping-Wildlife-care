The hunt for the elusive tiger in Bandipur is only intensifying but with little results. On Friday night, the tiger reportedly attacked and killed an elephant calf. The tiger has been sighted a few times during the search operations and captured in the camera trap images that the forest officials have set up to trace the tiger. When the search operations resumed on Saturday, the forest officials tried tracing the location where the elephant calf had been dragged but could not.

After an attack on a farmer on October 8th in Chowdahalli village, the forest department had released a statement saying that the “elusive tiger will be either captured or shot down within the next 24-48 hours.” This was the second attack on a farmer in less than a month, spreading panic and fear among villagers and farmers in the area. However the hunt for the tiger is still on. On Thursday, the officials saw indications of tiger movement in Hundipura village, located near the site of the attack. 

As wildlife activists protested against the decision to shoot down the tiger, the forest department now plans to tranquilize and capture the tiger when caught. The decision to shoot down the tiger was taken after widespread protests from the locals and family members of the deceased farmer. The forest officials have been continuing the search operation on elephants to sight the tiger in areas near Bandipur.
