The country’s ambitious plan of printing its currency on indigenised paper and ink near Mysuru, which faltered initially, has overcome all obstacles. The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), which had initially deferred its decision over the proposal to set up a currency printing unit on the outskirts of Karnataka’s culture capital Mysuru, has now given the green signal for the project citing no impact on the world famous Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary.
 
 	The NBWL which had reviewed the project during its earlier meeting in June 2015 had opined that the proposed project is located within the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Ranganathittu-world famous bird sanctuary on the banks of the Cauvery.  	
 	Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, a senior official from NBWL said, “Earlier we did not consider the project as the state government had not yet notified the ESZ around Ranganathittu. In the absence of ESZ, it was difficult to consider the project and hence the decision was deferred.” 
 	  	Bangalore Mirror had reported about NBWL’s initial reservation about the project on its edition dated June 26, 2015.
 	  	Following the NBWL’s meeting, the state government notified ESZ around the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary and submitted the ESZ plan to the central government. According to the proceedings of the NBWL’s 36th meeting held on November 4, a copy of which is with BM said, “The project is located well within the notified Industrial area outside the proposed ESZ and its importance in the manufacturing of currency paper within India is undoubtable.” Following the decision, the Standing Committee of the NBWL approved the project.
