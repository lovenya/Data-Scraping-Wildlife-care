Mysuru: A 15-year-old female elephant has died in Hanur buffer zone of Male Mahadeshwara wildlife sanctuary.
 
 
 
 
 
 The body of the elephant was recovered on February 13 at Pacchedoddi in Bavihalla forest region by forest officials. It is suspected that the elephant died the previous day.
 
 Sources from the department told BM that the elephant had drunk a large quantity of brackish water which might have caused its death due to an infection.
 
 They said a huge amount of soil was found in its stomach. Elephants many times consume soil. They were awaiting a post mortem report to know the exact cause of death.
 
 When asked if water scarcity had played a role, sources from the department said their region had sufficient amount of water for animals, being surrounded by good water resources. But they agreed that there was a decline in the amount of food for animals from any natural sources.
 
 Malathi Priya, Deputy Conservator of Forest, Male Mahadeshwara wildlife sanctury, said, “The post-mortem is done. And the doctors have said it is a natural death.”
 
 Department sources said there are more than 50 elephants in the region of which 35 are regularly spotted by the villagers.
 
 However, while water scarcity has raised its ugly face across the state, the sanctuary had enough sources of water.
 
 The state has witnessed the deaths of 8 tigers in just 43 days this year. Five of the deaths were attributed to human error.
