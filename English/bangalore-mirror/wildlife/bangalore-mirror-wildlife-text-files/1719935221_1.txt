The three feet snake was rescued from a house in Rajappa Layout, Kothanur 
 
 Tuesday began on a troublesome note for Dinto David. The HP employee had returned home from the night shift in the early hours of Tuesday, when he spotted a snake entering his house. Just as suddenly as it had appeared, the reptile vanished. 

 David thought it hid in the kitchen but wasn’t really sure. The 23-year-old and his family have had at least 15 encounters with snakes of different species in the last 10 years at their ground floor house in Rajappa Layout, Kothanur. David didn’t want to take any chances. He immediately called BBMP’s wildlife rescue cell. 

 Mohan K, city wildlife volunteer, arrived on the scene and started searching the kitchen. No sign of the snake. Next, he searched the hall. Still no sign of the snake. Finally, he started checking each shoe in the shoe rack. “That’s when I heard a hissing sound. I knew there was a snake nearby. As I scoured the place from where the sound was coming, I found the snake’s tail inside a shoe. When I tried to get near, the snake came out and raised its hood. It was a cobra.” 

 	Mohan made each move gingerly to catch the snake, which was about three feet long. Later, he released it into the wild. 

 	David said, “I had no clue that the snake was hiding in that shoe. After the snake disappeared in the house, I walked past that shoe many times, sometimes as close as 10 inches. I am really fortunate.” 

 	After the encounter, David, who stays with his mother, father, elder brother and sister, has decided to cover the open spaces around their house with a mesh. 

 	David’s house is close to a green patch. He suspects most of the snakes come from there. However, this is the first time a cobra has paid them a visit.
