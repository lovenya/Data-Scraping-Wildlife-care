It isn’t raining, nor is it hot. Yet, residents of Malleswaram are seeking shelter under umbrellas - their only defence against eagles that have attacked and injured many in the area. Having failed to keep them at bay, the residents have sent an ‘SOS’ to the BBMP and the forest sleuths.   In the last six months, more than 15 people were attacked by eagles in Malleswaram. In one attack on January 9, a resident had a cut in his eyelid, requiring sutures. “I was fortunate I escaped a serious eye injury. According to the doctor, I could have lost one of my eyes. We have sought the BBMP's help and the wildlife sleuths have visited the place,” T Ravi Kumar, a resident of Malleswaram, told Bangalore Mirror.    He has a three-storey house on Malleswaram 7th Cross, 7th Main next to a coconut tree, on top of which is an eagles’ nest. Those passing by the tree have come under attack from eagles. Though no one has dared to disturb the nest, the over-protective adult eagles have been hounding the passersby.   Ravi Kumar was attacked by the birds when he went to the terrace of his house. “I went to the terrace as I normally do. As it hovered over my head, I looked up, only to be injured by it. I needed six stitches in my eyelid. Since then, I have been trying to contact the authorities. Wish they can act immediately and prevent further attacks.""   On hearing the complaints, sleuths from BBMP suggested the residents use umbrellas while walking in the area and use scarecrows to ward them off. “Such attacks are common as the birds feel insecure during the mating season and because of eggs in the nest. We have made some suggestions to the residents. Hopefully, the attacks should stop. If the problem persists, we will have to find an alternative solution,” Sharath R Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, told Bangalore Mirror.
