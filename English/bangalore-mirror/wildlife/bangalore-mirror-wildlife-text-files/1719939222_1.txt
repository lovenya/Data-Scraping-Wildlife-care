An abandoned calf has found a new home in Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP). Officials said that they received a wild, abandoned male calf from the Halagur division of Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary on August 1. The calf was found alone on the way to Mutatthi on July 30 and was rescued by the forest department. For the next two days, the forest department tried to introduce the calf to various elephant herds but they rejected the calf .

“The calf is estimated to be around three to four months old and is currently being hand-fed by the mahouts. Calves without mother’s milk for a minimum of six months to one year have low disease resistance and hence survival rate of such calves is also low. To provide the best condition for the calf, the animal is under the intensive care of veterinarians and mahouts of BBMP,” said BBP’s executive director. A blood sample has also been sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biological, Hebbal to check for any viral infections.
