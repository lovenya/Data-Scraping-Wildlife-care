A ten-year-old female tiger was found dead in the HD Kote state forest limits, close to the Nagarhole National Park and Tiger Reserve. The post-mortem revealed old injuries on the tigerâ€™s body, possibly from territorial fights; it also had remnants of a wild boar in her stomach. This is the third tiger death in 10 days in Karnataka. 

Of the previous recorded deaths, one tiger died of natural causes in the Moolehole range of the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park forest area. Another young male tiger died in Periyapatna near Madikere, adjoining the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve and the post-mortem did not reveal any injuries. Officials are awaiting the forensic science report to ascertain the primary cause behind all these deaths, while maintaining that all were natural deaths. 

Recent reports state that there are around 110 tigers over 643 sq km of the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve area. While it is a positive sign that the number of tigers in the region has increased, the problem is that tiger density in the area has shot up too. 

Previously, two tigers were relocated to the Bhadra wildlife sanctuary, but both died immediately after relocation, due to which relocation of these tigers has been lauded as a bad idea. 

An official from the Forest Department credited the tussles between tigers on the ongoing mating season.
