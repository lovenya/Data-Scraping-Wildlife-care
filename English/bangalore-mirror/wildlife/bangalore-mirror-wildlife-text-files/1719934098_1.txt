Delivering its verdict on PIL filed by B R Deepak, a Bangalorean, the HC bench of Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice B S Patil okayed the state government’s proposal.

The HC has taken note of the fact that the state has promised to take adequate measures to maintain the safety of animals and a peaceful environment for them. In its project report to the HC, the government had also said that all necessary safety measures would be taken in the area earmarked for the night safari. 

However, the go-ahead is not a carte blanche. The HC asked the government to adhere to the project report and warned of strict action in case of any lapse. “If the state violates the terms and conditions, the current petitioner or any other public can move the HC against the authorities,” the court said. 

Deepak had challenged the move to start night safari in a biological park, saying that it would affect wildlife and cut through the elephant corridor. He said it was in violation of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

In its affidavit before the HC, the forest department, however, assured that the safari would not be operated beyond midnight and not more than 50 hectares will be covered. An earlier master plan of the Central Zoo Authority had mentioned the area to be covered as 110 hectares. 

The night safari will be operated between 6 pm and 11 pm on weekdays and till 12 am on weekends.
