Nine snakes have been rescued from one place by a 14-year-old boy and 27-year-old man on Thursday at Satyanagar near Byappanahalli.
 
 Alahan Nawaz(14) studying in the 9th grade and Gopi N (27) a bank employee rescued nine snakes in two days at the same spot.
 
 
 
 Gopi, who works near Byappanahalli, walks past that area every day. He saw some children throwing stones at the snakes. Gopi called up his friend Alahan to rescue the snakes.
 
 On Thursday the duo went to the spot at 5 p.m. and rescued five snakes with a hook which was then released in a lake. On Friday, the duo went to the spot again and rescued four snakes and was released in the lake.
 
 The snakes belonged to Checkered keelback which is mostly a water snakes. "The snakes were about 3 to 5ft long, harmless snakes. We didn't want these snakes to be killed and hence wanted to rescue them. We put all the snakes in a bag and released them in the lake," Alahan said.
 
 
 
 Both Alahan and Gopi are volunteers with Vanamitra, an organisation working towards conservation and wildlife. "I love animals; I was not a bit scared to rescue them. I didn't want it to be killed and hence I rescued them. I was trained by the organisation and have rescued nearly 40 snakes so far," Alahan said.
