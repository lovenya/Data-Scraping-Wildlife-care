Forest Minister announces June start date for long-awaited safari; camera tickets, aquarium projects, and animal care course also unveiled

Since 2017, there have been promises that the elusive leopard safari at Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) would start “soon.” Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre now says it may finally commence by the end of the month. On Monday, Khandre announced that the leopard safari would begin in June at BBP, which already houses lions and tigers. The safari will cover 3.5 acres, and the work is nearly complete. Officials believe that once the leopard safari opens to the public, it will attract more visitors. Currently, BBP safaris include lions, tigers, and bears. Initially, seven to eight leopards will be introduced into the safari area to prevent conflicts among them. “There are other challenges with leopard safaris because these cats tend to jump on trees, and extra security features have to be in place before the safari is open to the public,” said an official. BBP currently has 33 leopards, all housed at the rehabilitation centre for rescued tigers and lions.

To set up the country’s first leopard safari, BBP officials conducted extensive research. They visited zoos and leopard habitats at various locations, resulting in a carefully planned facility at BBP. The special enclosures, including the kraal, will each be 10,000 square feet in area. Eventually, these will be merged with the safari environment. The safari area will be isolated with a moat, and a 5-meter-high chain-link mesh over a rubble wall will ensure that no leopard strays out. The kraals will be covered with an overhanging mesh with the option to cover them completely. The leopards can rest inside their house at night and relax at the kraal during the day. The houses will also have provisions for veterinarians to move freely for treatments.

Camera tickets to be introduced
D During the 156th Zoo Authority Meeting at Vikas Soudha, strategies to attract more tourists and increase revenue were discussed. A detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared, and a consultant will be selected within 15 days for building an aquarium at Mysuru’s Sri Chamrajendra Zoo and Karanji Lake under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. Camera tickets will be introduced at Mysuru Zoo and Karanji Lake Nature Park. Proposals for freshwater and saltwater aquariums at Bannerghatta National Biological Park were approved. Measures to ensure sufficient wildlife veterinarians and prevent animal deaths were also discussed, with appointments and temporary local veterinary services approved.

Cauvery water for zoo
The government has approved the supply of Cauvery water to Bannerghatta Biological Park, and with the pipeline work completed, permission has been granted to release the water. Approval has been given to cover the medical expenses of 153 contract staff members at Bannerghatta Biological Park, who earn more than Rs 21,000 per month, as per CGHS rates. The Rhino Conservation and Breeding Center in Bannerghatta National Park will operate as a satellite centre of Bannerghatta Biological Park.
