Amid mounting pressure to grant permission to gun down the tiger wandering in Virajpet, the forest department officials - determined to catch and tranquillise the big cat - have further intensified their combing operations in the area. Speaker Bopaiah seeks licence to kill Coorg tiger 
 The officials have refused to go by the rumours that the tiger has retreated to the nearby Nagarhole National Park.  “Our staff have traced the pug marks from the affected area up to the national park. But it is difficult to confirm whether they belong to the same tiger or not. The only relief is that it has not attacked any livestock in any of the surrounding villages in the past five days,” said an official.
 
 “A few more personnel and sharp-shooters have been deployed to tranquillise and catch the tiger so that it can be released in the wild,” the official added. 
 
 After examining the pug marks, an expert team comprising Kodagu deputy conservator of forest, assistant conservator of forest from Hunsur wildlife division and range forest officers of the surrounding areas had earlier assumed that the tiger would have entered the Kallalla forest range. But fearing yet another possible attack, the officials decided to continue the search operations especially around the Konangeri area.
 
 Dasara elephant Abhimanyu was also brought from Mathigodu elephant camp to venture into the thick forest and search for the tiger.
