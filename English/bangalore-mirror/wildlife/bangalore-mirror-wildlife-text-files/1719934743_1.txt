Sundarbans (WB) The fragile ecology of the Sundarbans delta, which is home to four million people and the Royal Bengal Tiger, is facing a fresh threat from large-scale construction of concrete embankments all over the islands, environmentalists have warned.   Doubting the feasibility of these embankments as coastal erosion is constantly reshaping the islands, WWF's Anurag Danda said the engineering intervention would prove detrimental to the survival of unique flora and fauna of the UNESCO World Heritage site.   The archipelago of over 100 islands, a three-hour drive from Kolkata, is a complex network of streams, rivers, tidal creeks and channels. Spread over an area of 9,630 sq km in India, Sundarbans has the world's largest mangrove forest and also hosts a Tiger Reserve and three wildlife sanctuaries.   To protect the islanders from the cycle of twice-a-day floods and cyclonic storm surges, the West Bengal government has started the massive embankment reconstruction project (3,500 kms, Rs 5,032 crore).   “The ecology of the Sundarbans will get affected as the engineering interventions are not done keeping in mind the ecological realities of the area,” Professor Jayanta Bandyopadhyay, head of the Centre for Development and Environment Policy at IIM Kolkata, told PTI.   Experts also warn that covering the riverside slope of the embankment with polypropylene sheets, a non-biodegradable material, will violate environmental standards.
