In Bengaluru, numerous wild animals coexist with urban life. However, the presence of illegal snares poses a significant threat to these animals, inflicting wounds that often necessitate care. A recent revelation through camera traps vividly illustrated the suffering endured by these creatures near the city. The use of camera traps to comprehend wildlife populations stands as a widely accepted scientific methodology. Dr Sanjay Gubbi’s research on leopards has ingeniously applied this data, offering valuable scientific and natural history insights into various species. A recently published scientific paper in the international journal Ursus delves into how the distinctive body markings of sloth bears could serve as a means to estimate their home range.

“In Bannerghatta National Park (260 square kilometres), a camera-trapped sloth bear was found to have a distinct wound mark around its neck, possibly caused by a snare. Since sloth bears do not have natural markings on their bodies, individual animals are extremely difficult to identify. Hence, using this wound mark and Minimum Convex Polygon methodology, researchers estimated its home range to be about 58 sq km. During the years 2019 and 2020, this sloth bear was captured 40 times in 23 camera trap locations,” Gubbi said adding that though India is home to more than 90 per cent of the sloth bear population, to date, only one study had estimated the sloth bear home range using radio collar data.

Hence, the results of this study provide additional but important information about home ranges, highlighting that by-product camera trap data can also be very useful and provide valuable information on other species. Gubbi added that this study also suggests that despite living in smaller forest patches, sloth bears still require large habitats to thrive, emphasising the need for fewer negative interactions with humans.
