Koramangala police inspector SD Shashidhara arrested five poachers who had entered the city with at least 10 spiny-tailed lizards. 

These are Schedule 1 species protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 

On Wednesday, the police arrested five men when they were waiting near St. Johnâ€™s hospital to meet a customer and hand over the lizards. 

They have been identified as Ramesha Vellakaran (35) from Shikarimedu in Krishnagiri, Shakthi A (26), Gopi M (28) and Karna G (30) from Beragai village in Krishnagiri and Ivara Reddy from Krishnagiri. 

The police then informed the forest department and handed over the seized reptiles to be sent to the rescue centre at the Bannerghatta National Park.
