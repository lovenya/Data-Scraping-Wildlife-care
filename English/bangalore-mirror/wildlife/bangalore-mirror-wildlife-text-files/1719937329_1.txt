Gearing up for the World Wildlife Day, gloom enveloped Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) and conservationists across the state on Saturday as conservator and Field Director of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve S Manikandan was trampled to death by a tusker.
 
 Out in the forests of Dodda Byranakuppe (DB Kuppe) Range, close to the scenic backwaters of Kabini in Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, along with his staff to assess the damage caused by wildfire, a tusker, appearing out of nowhere, charged and trampled Manikandan to death, sources said.
 
 KFD sources told BM that on Friday a minor forest fire broke out in DB Kuppe Range and the forest personnel were successful in containing the fire in a day.
 
 “Manikandan, along with RFO Subramanya, and other officials, visited the area to assess the damage. When Manikandan was briefing staffers on different measures, a tusker charged from behind a bush. While RFO Subramanya fell down, the tusker chased Manikandan and pulled him with the trunk and crushed him against the tusk before tossing him up. Soon the staffers rushed him to hospital in HD Kote where doctors declared him dead,” a senior officer said. The 2001 Indian Forest Service (IFS) batch officer was posted as field director of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve two years ago. Ever since he took over, Manikandan was instrumental in reducing the man-animal conflict in the area. Known for his humble nature, Manikandan not only enjoyed the support and confidence of villagers inhabiting the periphery of Tiger reserve but also strived hard for wildlife conservation. Hailing from Theni in Tamil Nadu, Manikandan was a noted entomologist. Punati Sridhar, Principle Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of the Forest Force) told BM, “Never in the history of KFD did we witness this kind of tragedy. We are all with the family of Manikandan.”
