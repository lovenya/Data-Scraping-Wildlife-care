A Spurt in the number of big cats in five tiger reserves of the state seems to have left the state government on its toes. Acting swiftly over the long-pending proposal of strengthening its manpower, particularly the front-line battalion, the government has okayed recruitment for a whopping 834 posts in various categories and ranks. 
 
 Preparing itself for a bigger challenge in ensuring a healthy tiger count in all reserves and newly carved out sanctuaries, the department has initiated process of recruitment of 110 Range Forest Officers (RFOs), 113 Deputy RFOs, 329 Forest Guards and 282 Forest Watchers in a few months. The department has also decided to provide special perks and incentives to field staffers who are crucial in protecting the tiger reserves.
 Reeling under acute shortage of manpower, the department had witnessed several challenges on the conservational front. Poachers from neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra are increasingly targeting sanctuaries of Karnataka preying on both wildlife and natural resources to cater to illegal trade at the international market. Besides, the department is chalking out plans for protecting tigers and their habitats. “Constitution of anti-depredation camp with trained personnel to chase back wild animals intruding into human settlements, formation of rapid response team and strengthening the existing Anti-Poaching Camps (APC) will be prioritised. Proposals have been placed before the Finance Department,” explained forest minister Ramanatha Rai.
