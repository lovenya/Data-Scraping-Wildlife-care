Conservation centre’s efforts result in successful hatching of 11 peninsular rock agama eggs; this will help in preservation of these reptiles in their native habitats

PFA Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Centre recently, through their conservation efforts, led to the hatching of 11 peninsular rock agama eggs. The eggs, discovered by an informer named Chandan at the rescue site in Kengeri, were promptly handed over to the centre for specialised care. Chandan found the eggs on the ground next to trees, uncovered by mud. Transported in a small box with slightly wet cotton, the eggs reached the rescue centre safely.

Dr Madhav, Senior Veterinarian at PfA, commented on the rescued eggs, stating, “Upon close examination of the size and shape of the eggs, we identified them as peninsular rock agama eggs. The peninsular rock agama is a fascinating species of lizard native to south India, known for its distinct coloration and basking behaviour.”

 Colonel Dr Navaz Shariff, Chief Veterinarian at PfA, added, “The successful hatching of peninsular rock agama eggs by the PfA Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Centre highlights the importance of understanding their natural history. These agile climbers, with flattened bodies and well-developed limbs, play a vital role in their ecosystem by contributing to insect and invertebrate control while navigating through rocky terrain with ease. The conservation efforts of PfA contribute to the preservation of these fascinating reptiles in their native habitats.”

 The journey of the eggs from discovery to hatching was meticulously managed by PfA’s experienced team. After being candled to monitor embryo growth, the eggs were placed in an egg box filled with mud and water for incubation. Antifungal powder was applied to ensure the health and safety of the developing agamas. Maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels in the incubation room, the eggs were patiently monitored for 18 days until they successfully hatched. The eggs took approximately 14 days to hatch, being kept in mud with maintained temperature and humidity. All 11 eggs successfully hatched, and the agamas were released in a suitable habitat with shrubby areas containing sufficient vegetation and prey populations.
