On the B’luru-Dindigul highway, elephants are holding up traffic as they try to steal sugarcane from trucks passing by

At the Bengaluru-Dindigul highway these days, traffic pile-ups have become a common sight. But this is not due to rainfall or some construction work.
Over the last few weeks, the Bengaluru-Dindigul highway passing via Punajuru is being blocked by elephants trying to have its share of sugarcanes from the trucks passing by.

The story goes back when lockdown was imposed and the highway saw nearly zero traffic. As the highway passes through the thick forests, the absence of traffic helped the pachyderms to cross the highway. Later, when the rules were relaxed, the trucks carrying sugarcane used to frequent the highway. 

A few of the truck drivers who saw these animals around decided to drop some sugarcanes from their vehicles so that that the elephants could have it.

 Sources said that the elephants have got used to this and many times, they come around the trucks to use their trunks to pick up pieces of canes from the moving vehicles. When they do this, the two-wheelers and cars stop on the highway at a distance and wait for the elephants to clear the path. 

However, with many trucks passing by, this is rarely the case. In a video, motorists and car drivers can be seen trying to scare away the elephants as t
hey are clearly scared to move ahead. “Most of the highways have been built in forests, thereby obstructing the easy movement of wild animals. During the lockdown, the animals could go around without the fear of being hit or chased away. Now, with the traffic back to the pre-covid times, the wild animals are feeling the pinch of losing their territory,” said a wildlife enthusiast.
