They're rumoured to kill more humans than lions every year. 

 But that didn't stop a brave zoo keeper at Qingdao Wildlife World in east China's Shandong province practising a bit of dental hygiene on one of his hippo residents. 

 The giant animal happily opens his mouth wide for the keeper's huge toothbrush — or yard brush — to keep his pearly whites in tip top condition. 

 Nobody confirmed if he got a sticker for being a good patient, but it's worth noting the keeper only used one hand to venture into the beast's gaping mouth. Hippopotamus teeth are made of ivory, similar to the tusks of elephants. But hippo ivory is even more highly prized because it does not turn yellow with age. 

 	After a good brushing, the hippo's teeth must have been gleaming — perfect for a date with his needy companion seen swimming close by.
