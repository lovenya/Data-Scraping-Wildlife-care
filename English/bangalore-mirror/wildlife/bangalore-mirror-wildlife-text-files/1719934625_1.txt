Even as forest sleuths are fighting an uphill battle to check poachers, they seem to be unstoppable.   The city’s CID forest cell sleuths, who recently seized a fresh leopard skin and a black buck skin, have learnt that the leopard was shot less than 15 days ago. This has shocked them as it comes when forest sleuths have been put on high alert through repeated notices in this regard.    Both animals are protected under schedule I of Indian Wildlife Protection Act (IWPA). CID sleuths have arrested four persons in the case.   The notional value of the two skins seized in Chennagiri near Shimoga is said to be about Rs 4.5 lakh in the international market.   “We were shocked when we seized the skins. They were not like the ones we often see,” M K Murali, Dy SP, CID Forest Cell, told Bangalore Mirror. “The leopard skin was fresh. It was sticky, which indicated that the animal was killed recently, maybe about 15 days before we seized it. It has bullet marks, which makes it a clear case of poaching. We have alerted the police, who are investigating.”   Based on confirmed information on the gang trying to sell the skins, the accused, all residents of Chennagiri, were caught red-handed. Those arrested are Shankumar, Manjappa, Nagaraj and Basavantappa.   Chennagiri police are trying to find the source of the skins. They are also investigating the whereabouts of the poachers and other incidents they might be involved in.   “The accused have been booked for illegal possession of wildlife and attempting wildlife trade. If convicted, they will face at least three years of imprisonment,” added Murali.
