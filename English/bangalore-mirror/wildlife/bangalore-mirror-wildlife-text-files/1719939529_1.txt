Well-known movie director and wildlife photographer K Shivarudraiah is busy with the release of his latest Kannada movie Signal Man – 1971. This movie is based on the first person horror and mystery novel Signal-Man written by Charles Dickens.

“Charles Dickens’ novel Signal-Man inspired me a lot. I discussed about it with Prakash Belawadi who improvised the script for Indian sensibilities. It is a story from the Indo-Pakistan war in December 1971 set in a railway station in the western region. Though there is a station, no train halts here,’’ said director Shivarudraiah.

Elaborating on the story, Shivarudraiah said a photographer meets Balu, the signal man at the station. “The rest of the tale unravels the lonely life of the signal man and his troubled past,’’ the director said.

Prakash Belawadi plays a different role in this movie. “Shivarudraiah explained the concept to me and asked me to improvise the story and act in this movie. It was shot in Ooty, Kottigehara, Chikmagalur and Bengaluru. A huge set, of a railway station, was built for the shooting. I appreciate the co-stars and technicians for their cooperation,’’ said Belawadi.

The film has been selected for screening at the ongoing 14th edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival in Asian Cinema Competition section on March 26
and 29.
