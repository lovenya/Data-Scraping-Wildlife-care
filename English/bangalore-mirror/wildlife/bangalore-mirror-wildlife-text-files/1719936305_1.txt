Due to their proximity to Bengaluru, the two forests saw more than half the visitors to 20 national parks and sanctuaries in 2014-15 
 
 
 	Two biodiversity hotspots in the state are turning into stress zones with heavy tourist influx posing challenges for both the wildlife as well as the human visitors. More than half of the more than 7 lakh visitors to the 20 national parks and wildlife sanctuaries visited only the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mysuru and Bandipur Tiger Reserve in 2014-2015. 
 	
 	  	While Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mysuru is spread across only 0.67 sq km, it attracted 43 per cent of the total tourists (both domestic and international). Similarly, Bandipur Tiger Reserve drew 1,50,471 visitors in a year alone.
 	
 	  	Wildlife activists are concerned the heavy footfall will endanger the animals and birds in those areas. Besides, the huge crowds are also bound to create ‘stress’ for tourists themselves, say activists. 
 	
 	  	There have been a number of reports of travellers to Bandipur trying to stop their vehicles all along the road waiting for a sighting or trying to get a clearer view of an animal. 
 	
 	  	This could not only enrage the animals, but also result in man-animal conflicts. Activists point to the widely reported incident of an elephant which had snatched a bag from a tourist and made a meal of it while the tourist was attempting a selfie. 
 	
 	  	There have also been reports of tourists using intimidating tactics to scare away birds at Ranganath-ittu, thus imperilling the entire ecosystem. One of the main reasons for tourists flocking these pla-ces is their proximity to Bengaluru.
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	  	On the other hand, Shettihalli Wildlife Sanctuary in Shivamogga, spread across 395.60 sq km, had only 16 visitors in the entire 2014-15. This skewed difference has put tremendous pressure on a few national parks and sanctuaries in the state. Of the total 7.2 lakh visitors to parks and sanctuaries, 5.1 lakh visited the five — Ranganathittu, Bandipur, Brahmagiri, Sakarebylu and Nagarhole National Park.
 	
 	  	The Economic Survey of Karnataka 2015-16 calls for stepping up facilities and infrastructure in the lesser visited parks and sanctuaries in order to reduce the high pressure of eco-tourism on a few parks/sanctuaries. 
 	
 	  	The survey has particularly emphasised on developing BRT Tiger Reserve, Bhadra Tiger Reserve and Dandeli Reserve.
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	  	Karnataka hasn’t fared well in attracting foreign tourists to its national parks and sanctuaries either. Of the over 7 lakh tourists, only 15,873 were foreign tourists. In the first nine months of 2015-16, the number of foreign tourists was a piffling 10,238 compared to nearly 5 lakh total tourists.
