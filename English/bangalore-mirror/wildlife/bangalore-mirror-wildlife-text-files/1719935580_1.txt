A day after a man-eating tiger was hunted down in Belagavi forest, forest sleuths have come across a leopard-eating poacher who has confessed to hunting and eating the animal. 

 	The details came to light when forest sleuths of Aldur range in Chikkamagaluru district arrested 25-year-old K P Jeevan, a resident of Kodegadde in Moodigere taluk of Chikkamagaluru district and seized a leopard skin that he was trying to sell on Saturday. 

 	According to forest officials, Jeevan shot the leopard with his licensed weapon in the reserve forest of Aldur range. 

 	Sources said the accused has confessed that after shooting the animal, he along with some labourers had eaten the meat of the 3-year-old leopard. Experts said that someone eating the meat of a leopard is unheard of as it is inedible. However, they said his confession will make it easy to prosecute him. 

 

 	First case of meat being consumed 

 	“This is first case we have come across of leopard meat being consumed. Usually, they are shot for skin and nails. This is an open and shut case as he has confessed to having eaten the leopard’s meat with others. This makes the case indisputable unlike in seizure cases wherein it takes hard to prove possession of wildlife product and hunting,” Sharath R Babu, chief wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban told Bangalore Mirror.
 	
 	To strengthen the case, wildlife sleuths have launched a hunt for the weapon used to shoot the leopard and are looking for another accused in the case identified as Babu. Forest officials have also launched a hunt for the labourers who are said to have taken away the claws after eating the leopard meat and handing over the skin to Jeevan. “He has been booked under various sections of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. We have also seized a vehicle bearing number KA 18 N 7801. The investigation is on,” A N Jayakumar, the range forest officer of Aldur range, told Bangalore Mirror.
