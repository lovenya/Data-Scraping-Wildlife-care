In a rare rescue, wildlife rescuers in the city have rescued a white adult (Leucistic) Cobra near Yelahanka Bagalur cross successfully. 

The snake was rescued from a home compound after the owners found the snake hiding. Rajesh Kumar, rescuer says, "The snake is 5 foot long and is currently in a Bannerghatta veterinary hospital. The snake will be released in the wild as per the directions of BBMP Wildlife Cell. This is the second white Cobra I have rescued in my 10 years of career. It's a rare one."

In 2018 too, the wildlife rescuers in the city had rescued an Albino cobra, a rarely found snake. Albinism is found to be rare in snakes and occurs due to lack of pigments in the skin. While albino snakes are completely white in colour, leucistic snakes suffer from partial loss of pigments and the eyes remain unaffected from the loss of pigments on the skin. The captured cobra who suffers from the latter has black patches near its head.

Rescuers say due to extreme temperatures early this year, snakes are found entering homes these days and the numbers of snake rescue calls have gone up. "Snakes are moving closer to cooler areas, water bodies due to heat and in the process end up entering homes," said Kumar.
