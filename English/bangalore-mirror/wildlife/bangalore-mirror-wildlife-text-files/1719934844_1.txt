Spawning of corals, popularly referred to as ‘sex on the reef’, has been recorded scientifically for the first time along Lakshadweep, according to Wildlife Trust of India.   Procreation by corals is a magnificent phenomenon involving collective release of colourful eggs and sperm clouds (gametes) into the water by the marine animals.   The gametes then rise to the surface of the ocean creating a colourful slick. The vivid patch was first observed by WTI marine biologist Subburaman S last week, and also by the Central Marine Fisheries and Research Institute.   “I was travelling by boat, when I noticed an interesting effect in the water. Out of curiosity, I collected some pink and brown spawn for examination,” Subburaman was quoted in a WTI release. Subburaman with the support of CMFRI scientists Dr Jasmine and R Srinath examined the samples and confirmed that they were indeed coral spawn.   Environmentalists say this finding proves that Lakshadweep's corals are recovering from the stress they experienced after El Niño in 2010.    Coral spawning is a big tourist attraction in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, where it generally happens soon after the full moon in November or December.
