Fourteen Alexandrine Parakeet fledglings that were in a bad shape after being rescued from a man who was trying to sell them online, have now grown up and found freedom. Bangaloreans, open your purse-strings for these 21 babies After being taken care of for seven months by volunteers at the Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre and fed out of money donated by kind-hearted Bangalore Mirror readers, the grown up parakeets were released last month in the Bramhagiri – Pushpagiri range in south Kodagu.   BM readers had donated about Rs 2.5 lakh for the feed which had to be imported. After being cared for by the WRRC team for several months, 14 birds that survived successfully were released in the Kodagu forests. Some of the birds can be spotted occasionally when they return to their feeding stations.   Gopi Shankar, honorary secretary of WRRC, in an email, thanked BM readers for their support. “From the time they came to us, to the time they were successfully raised and rehabilitated in South Kodagu, what we managed to do would not have been possible without your help and the generosity of your readers,” he said.   The rescue
 In December 2012, CID sleuths had rescued 21 Alexandrine Parakeets from a city-based IT consultant who tried to sell them. Later they were sent to the WRRC. However, bringing them was a cause for worry as they needed to be fed with feed imported from Australia that cost Rs 4,000 a kg. After being fed with imported food initially, they graduated to natural food like nuts, grains and fruits. Fourteen of them survived.
