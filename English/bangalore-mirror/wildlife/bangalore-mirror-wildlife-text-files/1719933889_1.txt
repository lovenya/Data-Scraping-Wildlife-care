The zoo was donated Rs 5,63,347 by 2420 Infoscions, including trainees, for the adoption of 31 animals last year. It has issued receipts to those who donated amounts above Rs 500. The money will be used for feeding the animals for one year.

  

The employees donated the amount under Welfare of Wildlife (WoW) Project, a voluntary movement spearheaded by Voice of Youth, a group of 15-18 employees at the IT company. They began the movement on Aug 15 last year after they received a request for help from the zoo authorities.

“It’s a record contribution towards the adoption of animals from employees representing one organisation,” said Executive Director of the zoo Vijay Ranjan Singh. He said altogether 140 animals at the zoo have been adopted till now this year and it received Rs 13,20,289 for the purpose.

Privileges to adopters

Besides the receipt valid for tax exemption, those who adopt animals at the zoo also get an adoption certificate and complimentary passes for five family members to visit the zoo through the year. The name of the person is also displayed in front of the enclosure of the adopted animal. 

Raghavendra, HR manager, Infosys, Mysore, said there was no pressure from the company on the employees to adopt the animals. “They did it voluntarily. While some of them wanted to be involved in our conservation efforts, a few of them did it as gifts for their children/grandchildren,” he said.

“I love Mysore zoo. It maintains clean store rooms and prepares 300 to 400 dishes in its kitchen for the animals. No rotten food is given to the animals. If there is an ISO 2000 certification for zoos, they will get it,” said Vinod, who was among those spearheaded the movement.
