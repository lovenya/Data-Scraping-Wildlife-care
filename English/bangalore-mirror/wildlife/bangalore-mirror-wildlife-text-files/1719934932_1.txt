Wildlife cell sleuths were called in to rescue a bird so rarely seen, that despite the emaciated condition of the winged creature, volunteers could not help but smile when they laid eyes on it.    The cell was called on Saturday to rescue a blue-faced malkoha lying on the road that connects Kengeri and Tavarekere at Sulkere junction. The bird, which sleuths say is only about three months old, was in poor shape when it was found.    “In my 25 years of experience of rescuing birds, this is only the second time I was holding a malkoha,” said Salim Hamid, BBMP forest cell facilitator. “Although found in south India, it is rarely seen or spotted because it is a very secretive bird and dives into the bushes as soon as it spies someone nearby.”   Malkoha are of the cuckoo family and are considered large birds of the order, but the one found on Saturday weighed a mere 110gms.    Shivraj N, another volunteer of the cell who rescued the bird, revealed that a techie visiting the nearby Sai Baba temple had spotted the bird and had called the cell. “The techie too found the bird very rare,” said Shivraj   The malkoha was housed at the emergency rehabilitation centre and was fed fluids and water for a day before it was released at the same spot on Sunday.    “This one must have been less than three months old and at that age fledglings are dependent on their parents,” said Sharath Babu, wildlife expert, BBMP Forest Cell. “So it had to be released at the same spot.”
