Owners of vehicles adorn with blackbuck horns will now land up in jail besides getting slapped with heavy fines as per the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. And this is not just in Bengaluru, but across Karnataka. State police chief, director general & inspector general of police (DG & IGP) Om Prakash, has ordered arresting and booking the motorists all over Karnataka who install blackbuck horns – which are believed to bring good fortune – atop their vehicles.
 
 The police have already booked ten such motorists, mainly in the districts of North Karnataka, and in Ballari and Hassan, where this practice is prevalent, and where the supply, too, is easier due to the proximity to Ranebennuru Blackbuck Sanctuary.
 
 The police and forest department officials believe poachers and hunters to be active within the sanctuary to meet the growing demand for the horns, which are also being smuggled to the urban centres, including Bengaluru. This stringent measure followed soon after the forest department wrote to the state police chief, appealing that criminal proceedings be initiated against vehicle owners using horns of the blackbuck, an endangered species.
 
 The rampant violation was earlier brought to the notice of the forest and police departments in a complaint filed by honorary wildlife warden, R Sharath Babu. He pointed out that sporting blackbuck horns atop vehicles was an offence as per the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and urged cracking down on the offenders. Wildlife activists are supporting the police with relevant data so they understand the urgency of Babu’s letter of appeal.
 
 The letter drew officials’ attention to the fact that blackbucks did not shed their horns naturally – which meant if they are adorning vehicles, they would have been sold after the blackbucks were poached to meet the demand, with an eye on making a quick buck. The forest department, too, highlighted the issue.
