‘Kidoor Bird Fest’ identifies 149 birds, including rare ones, in its village territory
 
 Five conservationists, including two students, are redefining bird conservation in Kidoor, a tiny hamlet in the bordering Kasargod district of Kerala. The trigger was when Raju Kidoor, a teacher, Maxim Kollangana, a wildlife conservationist, Prashanth Posadi Gumpe, a chemist, Pradeep Kidoor, a degree student and Glen, a Class X student, spotted an Orange-Breasted Green Pigeon — a bird found across the Indian sub-continent and South East Asia. Soon, they organised ‘Kidoor Bird Fest’ to spread the message of conservation.
 
 Raju Kidoor told BM: “We, along with the social forestry division, celebrated the birthday of celebrated ornithologist Salim Ali as ‘Kidoor Bird Fest’ on November 12.
 
 It was also on this day that 31 Orange-Breasted Green Pigeons (Treron bicinctus) were sighted last year. It is considered as an iconic bird of the village.
 
 The flight of the Orange-breasted green pigeon is really fast and they eat seeds and fruits of a wide variety of plants. The breeding season in India is between March and September and in Sri Lanka, it’s from December to May.”
 
 The group even had a ‘night stay’ to document nocturnal birds.
 
 Raju Kidoor said, “The programme began on Saturday afternoon and went on till Sunday afternoon. A ‘night stay’ was held to document the nocturnal birds. About 57 birders, including three officers from forest department including Sathyan, Biju Mon and Sunil, eight birders from ‘Calicut Friends of Nature’ and students from upper primary and high school, supported by Kumbla Gram panchayat president Pundarikaksha KL, took part in the event.”
 
 “A total of 57 birds were recorded, including Brown Shrike and Booted Eagle, a first for the village. With this the total number of species recorded for Kidoor so far is 149,” he said. Besides, the team managed to convince a woodcutter from preventing cutting a tree, home to rare birds.
