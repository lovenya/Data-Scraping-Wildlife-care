MLA, a wildlife warden, will raise the issue in the assembly for a permanent solution
 
 	Basavangudi MLA Ravi Subramanya, an honorary wildlife warden who has to give solutions for wildlife issues, is bogged down by a strange problem, of late - about 8 monkeys in his constituency have become a headache. 

 	He has sought help from the forest department to relocate the troublesome macaques from Basavangudi. He has offered to bear the costs. 

 	Subramanya told Bangalore Mirror. “Some monkeys have surfaced near Girinagar bus stand. They are creating trouble for children. This issue is sensitive and adds to the stray dog menace Bangaloreans are already troubled with. I have called the forest department and our residents for a meeting to find a solution” 

 	Two children have been bitten, but the monkeys can’t be done away with, as they are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Any attempt to handle monkeys and Bonnet Macaques should be done in consultation with the forest department. 

 	With the monkey menace being reported in several parts of city, especially those in city outskirts and in places which were once lung space, the issue will be raised in the state assembly to find a permanent solution, Subramanya added. 

 	“The public should be educated on discouraging feeding monkeys, which only draw more of them,’’ he said.
