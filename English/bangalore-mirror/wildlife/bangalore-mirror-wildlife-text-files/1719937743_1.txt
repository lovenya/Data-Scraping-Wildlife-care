The Karnataka government’s State Wildlife Board meeting, slated to be held on January 9, for the Hubballi-Ankola railway line is getting much flak from environmentalists. They are firm in their opinion that the line is not needed at all but is an attempt to make money and encroach upon the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats. The meeting is to be chaired by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy.

The Hubballi-Ankola project has already been rejected by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and senior forest officials. Yet the government has been pushing for the line.

Vijay Nishanth, tree doctor and activist, said, “More than two lakh trees will be felled if the State Wildlife Board gives the go-ahead. Yet the Karnataka government is hell-bent on this project.” Environmentalist Joseph Hoover seconds him. “We will be losing our birds and wildlife too. The railway line will be cutting though the elephant corridors. This line is just going to intensify man-animal conflicts,” he said.

On February 2, environmentalists will be holding a state-wide protest. They point to the existing Hubballi-Karwar line to say that the Hubballi-Ankola railway line is not needed. 

“Karnataka has only 19% forest cover left. We need development but not at the cost of our environment,” said Hoover, adding that “The railway and highway projects must be undertaken outside the green covers. No forest equals to no water. We will also approach the court if need be.”

Another agenda that will be raised in the meeting will be the four-lane project that cuts through forests. As per NHAI, four lanes are required only if the traffic density on the road is 10,000 vehicles. But the Belgaum to Goa highway will have vehicle density of approximately 2,000. The highway will cut through Khanapur forest where 60,000 trees will be chopped down. Incidentally, the numbers of tigers have recently increased in Khanapur.
