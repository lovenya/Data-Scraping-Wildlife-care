Controversial project’s revival rekindles their hopes

With the Central Water Commission giving nod for the controversial Mekedatu project, the Karnataka government is keen to make the project happen without delay. 

However, villagers say a bridge along the reservoir — a long-pending demand— be constructed first so that Bengaluru is connected closer to the hinterlands of Chamarajanagar district.

Currently, those who are heading to Male Mahadeshwara Hills, Hanur and other areas must take a detour via Kollegal. It is said that if the bridge is constructed along with the Mekedatu reservoir, then travelling to MM Hills, Hanur and other places will become closer at least by 50 km. In fact, for long, there has been a demand from residents of Hanur and MM Hills for a shorter route.

As the road passes through the reserve forest, no permission has been granted earlier. “We have been demanding a bridge for the last 15 years. Now, the Mekedatu project has rekindled our hopes so that we are closer to Bengaluru,” said Rajendra Gowda, a resident of Hanur. Even now, if one visits places like Muttatti, it is a common sight to see people taking their two-wheelers to cross the either sides of Cauvery. There are villages on either side of the river but with no road link, villagers are forced to take a detour. The last bridge in Cauvery on Karnataka side is near Sattegala and the next bridge is after Hogennakal in Tamil Nadu.

However, environmentalists oppose the plan. “We have been opposing the bridge. It is being planned at the Cauvery wildlife sanctuary, home to diverse flora and fauna.” 

DCF (MM hills wildlife zone) V Yedukondalu said, “It’s too early to comment. the CWC has asked for a Detailed Project Report (DPR). DPR must be submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Then the environment impact assessment will be done, There is a long way ahead.”
