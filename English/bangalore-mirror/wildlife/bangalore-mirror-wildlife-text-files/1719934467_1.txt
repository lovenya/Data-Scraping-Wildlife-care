Surely it’s an escape many of us dream about while trudging into the office. But Brendon Grimshaw has done just that. In 1962, the Yorkshireman bought Moyenne -- a small island just half a mile wide -- in the Seychelles for the princely sum of £8,000, and he has been living there ever since. The sprightly 86-year-old wakes to the sound of rustling palm trees and the Indian Ocean lapping against the shore. He spends his days caring for the island’s tortoises and birds that also call it home, reports the Daily Mail.
 
   When he bought Moyenne, it was overgrown with scrub so dense that coconuts could not fall to the ground. But Brendon worked tirelessly to transform the island into his own little patch of heaven. Living in this unique wildlife reserve, he has survived tropical storms, sharks, ghosts, a coup d’etat in the Seychelles and a mercenary raid. Scattered over a vast area of the Indian Ocean, the 115 islands of the Seychelles are among the most spectacular on the planet. There are just 85,000 inhabitants, but hundreds of secluded beaches.
