Former India captain and leg spinner Anil Kumble, also an avid wildlife photographer, expressed that the Indian mammals- A field guide by Vivek Menon, will be a ‘must carry book’ on his next expedition into the wild. The book is a profusely illustrated guide to more than 400 species of mammals of the Indian sub-continent and has been widely acknowledged by wildlife enthusiasts across the country, since its launch. With more than 1000 images and 150 distribution maps, this flexi bound field guide is a must have for all conservationists, nature lovers, travellers and school libraries. The book is available at book stores for Rs595. Menon, the author and also the founder and CEO of Wildlife Trust of India, talks to us about the book and its importance.
 
 Tell us about some key features of the book...
 
 The 200 page book is accompanied by full-colour photographs and distribution maps and is based upon impeccable scientific research reviewed by experts. The guide records details of virtually every mammal known to exist in India. From tigers, elephants, rhinos, whales to primates, rodents and bats, it also describes key identification features, biometrics, behaviours, social strategies, habitat and distribution of the mammals. While in the wild, one can confuse a rhesus macaque for a bonnet macaque. This guide will help in identifying better.
 
 You have brought out eight books in the past, why does this book stand out?
 
 The book has been a culmination of many years of hard work and I am pleased at the result in shape of the book. My previous book has 50 per cent of its pictures shot outside the country but for this book most of it is from India and that’s been very satisfying. I am happy that the book has been receiving such a tremendous response.
