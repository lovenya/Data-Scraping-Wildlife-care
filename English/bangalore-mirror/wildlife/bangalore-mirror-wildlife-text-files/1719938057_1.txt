Hyderabad: A degree student lost his way in dense forest while taking video for TikTok and came alive with the help of WhatsApp.

The strange episode took place in Seshachalam forest adjoining Tirumala hills in Andhra Pradesh. 

The youth is identified as third year degree student Murali of Kalakada block in Chittoor district. 

According to police, Murali entered the forest in Chandragiri area on Sunday noon. He went to do a TikTok video placing tricolour on top of a hill in the forest.
He finished doing the video but, lost his way and became clueless. After unsuccessfully struggling for some time to find the way, he stumbled upon the idea to WhatsApp his location to his friend.

The friend alerted his family members who approached the police for help.

The police formed teams to search for the missing boy as per the location shared by him. After several hours of search, they found him lying in an unconscious condition around 3 am on Monday.

The cops rushed Murali to a hospital where he recovered after first aid.

Seshachalam forest is home to wildlife including leopards. The wildlife often comes out to the footway to Tirumala hill shrine and attack the pilgrims. Recently, a girl suffered grievous injuries in a leopard attack.

The forest is also home to precious red sanders. Smugglers from neighbouring Tamil Nadu are usually on the prowl in the jungles at nights for the precious wood.

TikTok has been costing youngsters in different ways. Some lost lives and many suffered punishments in their jobs.
