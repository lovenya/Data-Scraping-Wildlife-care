Posters of films, plastered across walls of public buildings, have been a menace in the city. But now, Bharat Lal Meena, commissioner of Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, is roping in advertisers to put up posters and hoardings that display social awareness messages.

Designated parts of the flyovers and underpasses will soon display posters that will educate the masses about tourism, wildlife, maintaining greenery and other such social issues.

The commissioner has issued orders to paste these posters at government buildings and flyovers like Anand Rao Circle, Richmond Circle, Mysore Road, Rajajinagar underpass to name a few. “A meeting was organised with the officials and advertisers in the city asking them to come out with a list of government buildings, flyovers and other suitable places where these posters can be displayed,” said Meena.

The advertisers have agreed to shake hands with BBMP, but a formal agreement is yet to be signed. “We are ready to promote BBMP’s idea, but the advertisers should also benefit from this. We should also be given space below the BBMP promotional campaign where we can promote our products,” said an advertiser.

Through these posters, the BBMP is also planning to educate school children about traffic rules. BBMP officials will talk to the education department and also get schools involved. According to the plan, traffic rules and regulations will be painted on the walls of school buildings.

Apart from this, hoardings will also be put up near lakes, in order to educate people about the importance of lakes and how to keep them clean.
