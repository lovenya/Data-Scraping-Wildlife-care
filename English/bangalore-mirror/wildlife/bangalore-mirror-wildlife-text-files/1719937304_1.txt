For four years, birder Dr S Shishupala, Professor, Department of Microbiology, Davanagere University, Shivagangothri campus has been recording the visits of the bar-headed geese from Mongolia to Davanagere.
 
 Bar-headed geese fly at altitudes that are extremely challenging. They are the world’s highest flying birds and can fly higher than the Mount Everest when they migrate over the Himalayas. They can be found in Asia, China, Russia and the United Kingdom.
 
 Dr S Shishupala said, “For the past four years, I have been recording the bar-headed geese that visit Davanagere from Mongolia. I got to know that these birds are coming from Mongolia after I chanced upon a tag on the neck of one of the bird’s that read ‘X90’. I took a picture of the bird and searched for people who were doing research on the bird. I sent them pictures taken in Davanagere. Dr Bat Bayer from Mongolia Wildlife Research Centre confirmed that he had tagged the bird. They had covered the aerial route of 4,900 kilometres, crossing Mount Everest and reaching Davanagere. I had photographed the tagged bird on Nov 23, 2015. I compared the temperatures in Bayan lake in Mongolia and Kunduvada lake, Davanagere. By November 10, the temperature there reaches minus 10 and the lake is frozen. As the temperature drops there, they fly to warmer places and, for four years, I have been recording them in Davanagere. These birds have modified haemoglobin that helps in absorption of more oxygen and have extra arteries in their flight muscles.”
 
 The birds will leave Davanagere in the first week of March. From here, they will fly to Tibet/Ladakh and breed there. They then travel to Mongolia along with their young ones in May. These flying migratory birds fly above 25,000 feet and can cover 100 miles in an hour. They are known as ‘parvatha hakki’ in Kannada,” Shishupala said.
