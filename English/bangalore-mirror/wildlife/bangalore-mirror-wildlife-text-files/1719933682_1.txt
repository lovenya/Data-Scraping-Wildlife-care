Diesel vehicles may soon give way to petrol vehicles in the woods. The state forest department is working towards phasing out the use of diesel vehicles by their officers in reserve forests. The plan is to slowly work out the process, said I B Srivastava, PCCF-Wildlife.

“We do not plan on getting rid of the existing diesel vehicles immediately. Instead, when there is a requirement for new vehicles, we will bring in petrol vehicles instead of diesel ones. That way, we will gradually replace diesel vehicles,” he said. According to officials, the move has been undertaken to primarily reduce the noise and pollution that a diesel vehicle causes. “Also petrol vehicles are more efficient in rugged terrains of the forests along with being more eco-friendly,” said the PCCF.

With the department constantly mulling over the lack of funds for various requirements and long pending payments to guards and watchers who are employed on contract, can they really afford petrol vehicles? “We will need to ask the government to allocate more funds when needed,” said Srivastava.

And what about salaries for the guards? “We have released some funds for the same but it does not cover two reserve forests, Nagarhole and Bandipur. That will be done in 15 days,” stated the PCCF.
