In a case of charity beginning at home, BBMP wildlife volunteers residing at Malleshwaram 11th cross clean and preserve trees in the area on their own without waiting for civic workers. Three volunteers of the BBMP’s wildlife cell dedicate their weekends to removing posters and advertisements nailed to trees on the road. Such advertisements are illegal.   “On weekdays, we are into rescuing wildlife but during weekends we work on keeping trees in our vicinity clean and healthy,” Rajesh M, one of the volunteers, told Bangalore Mirror. “Advertisements and posters are proving dangerous to trees. We are trying to address the problem at the individual level.” He is joined by Adi, Yogi and other local residents who were inspired by the trio’s efforts.    Unlike others, they call the numbers on the advertisements and educate those who put them on the importance of trees and the harm caused by nailing them to trees.    “The parts of trees where the nails go in get decayed. Secondly, it results in insects making their dwellings in the trees. This reduces the life span of the trees. Under the Tree Act, trees can’t be used for commercial advertising. More than this, it affects the beauty of the city,” Rajesh added.   The team has been on the job for two months, which has inspired their friends in other parts of the city, including Nagarbhavi, Chandra Layout and RMV Extension.   Their drive is also creating awareness among residents who are alerting team whenever they come across such acts.
