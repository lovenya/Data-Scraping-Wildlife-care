Kendrapara (Odisha): Wildlife lovers are jubilant as over 2000 babies of estuarine crocodiles have come out of eggshells in and around the crocodile research farm in Bhitarkanika National Park in Odisha's Kendrapara district.   “Over 2000 crocodile hatchlings broke out of eggshells to make their way into water-bodies and water-inlets of Bhitarkanika National Park. Fifty-one croc nests had been sighted in the wild this year by enumerators,” said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (Wildlife) Forest Division.   “The forest personnel maintained safe distance from the nests as human interference makes the reptiles violent,” he said   Female crocodiles lay 50 to 60 eggs and the hatchlings usually emerge from the nests after 70 to 80 days.   The annual captive breeding of crocodiles' eggs was suspended this year as the enclosure where 'rear and release' programme of these endangered species takes place, is being repaired. The eggs collected from the wild are hatched here artificially, said DFO Mahapatra.   The rear and release of these hatched reptiles has been going on since 1975, funded by the United Nations Development Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Officials said they had to take care to prevent the eggs from being devoured by snakes, jackals and dogs, found in the reserve.
