Designer Kunal Rawal, the young creative head behind the latest look of Rajasthan Royals, wants to go back to his teens.“When I was 19, I wanted to be 21 so that I could go to the casinos. 

But now I realise that those days were far better than these. I would love to swing back in time,” says the 23-year-old designer.   

Kunal grew up in a family where fashion resides. With a label called D-stress already under his belt, he has also been the youngest designer ever to showcase at the Lakme Fashion Week for over three years now. But it’s his first ever step as a designer that he is still quite hooked on to. “I had showcased my first collection at a night club called Squeeze in Mumbai and I always wished my first show to be the best. I had hosted a show party for over 500 people. There was great music and the beach theme simply rocked,” he gushes saying I am still stuck with it. 

He believes that fashion is at its best when it is constantly tried and tested. And designing for men is  a sure challenge for him. “There is so much happening at the women’s front and their is absolutely nothing for men. I am trying to fill in the gap through experimenting new looks,” he says, who believes that brown is the new black. 

Coming to where we had started, the IPL, he has designed two looks for Rajasthan Royals giving them great variation of fashion and style. He has created a mélange incorporating the royal touch of Rajasthan and the wildlife of South Africa. “I have drawn a close face of deer to add the whole South African effect, keeping the colours soft. The whole look is completed with a jacket. The second look ensembles a greyish black bandgala with utility pocket and the Rajasthan Royals logo is emblazoned on the golden buttons to give a royal touch”, he says.
