Villagers look at an elephant carcass                 Of the seven, four were adults and three babies. While four died on the spot, three succumbed to their injuries on Thursday morning.

Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) A K Raha said this is one of biggest toll of elephants in a single incident. “It’s sad and I think the Railways should take up some programme to prevent suchincidents in future.”

Forest officials said a herd of about 30 elephants was moving from the Maraghat Range forest to Diana forest. The accident occurred at a crossing of Moraghat Tea Estate under Banarhat in the Binaguri Police Station jurisdiction.

“There have been incidents where one or two elephants have died in such accidents, but the number has never been so high. Though elephants destroy crops, villagers never attack them,” Raha added. However, locals said the toll was much higher than the official version. 

Both passenger and goods trains run through forested areas from North Bengal to Assam taking the Dooars routes. People in the area worship the elephant as God, though many villagers, mainly ethnic Nepalis and tribal Santhals, fall prey every year due to man-animal conflict in the forest areas. 

With the elephant carcasses blocking the tracks, the goods train had to be towed back to Banarhat station. Northeast Frontier Railway officials said movement of train to and from Siliguri-Assam had been suspended since last night.
