Forest officials of Chitradurga division nabbed four people on Saturday night for allegedly planning to poach wild animals at a forest near Hiriyur. All the accused have been remanded to judicial custody for 14 days.

The accused have been identified as Ikshu Dhauva, 42, from Shivamogga, Vasudeva Shetty, 49, Vinod, 30 and Prathap Rathnaswamy, 45, from Bengaluru.

“We raided a farmhouse adjacent to the forest while the accused were planning to poach wild animals. We produced the accused before the taluk magistrate on Sunday,’’ said Harsha, forest officer Hiriyur range.

According to Raghuram HG, an honorary wildlife warden of Chitradurga, the accused had enquired with a shepherd about deer in the forest. “The shepherd happened to see them with possession of guns. He informed me about them. I visited the spot for verification,’’ said Raghuram.

He said the forest officials conducted the raid on Saturday night. “We wanted to nab them while poaching wild animals but decided to take them into custody before they could execute their plan. It is for the first time we seized such a number of firearms and other poaching materials,’’ he said.

Forest officials seized four guns, one pistol, two archery sets, high-powered flashlights, gas cylinders, pressure pumps and other hunting material. They also seized two Mahindra Thar Jeeps and one Mahindra Scorpio vehicle from the accused.

Raghuram said that a few months ago, some poachers had killed a few peacocks and blackbucks in the forest. “Poachers also killed three jackals after feeding them explosives-laden chicken meat in August,’’ he said.

The assistant conservator of forest of Chitradurga division has been assigned to investigate the case.
