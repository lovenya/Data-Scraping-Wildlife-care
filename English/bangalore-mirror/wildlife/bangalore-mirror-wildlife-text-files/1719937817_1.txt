Bengaluru: The Pilikula Biological reserve welcomed its new guests . As part of the animal exchange programme between Pilikula Zoo in Mangalore and Vandalur Zoo in Chennai, one pair of Indian Gaur (bison) arrived at the bio-diversity park.

Along with them were also 10 pairs of painted stork, 12 night heron and three pairs of reticulated python. In return, Pilikula Zoo has sent two pairs of king cobra, Whitaker’s boa and wolf snake to the Vandalur Zoo. Under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, the Indian bison is listed as an endangered species.

“The reticulated python is considered the world’s longest non-venomous snake and is native to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands,” stated HJ Bhandary, Director, Pilikula Biological Park.
