A wildlife park has banned visitors from wearing leopard print clothing because it is confusing the animals. Chessington World of Adventures Resort today introduced the zero-tolerance policy on animal print and brought in bouncers to enforce it. Animal print-wearing visitors will be handed grey boiler suits to wear everywhere in the park so as not to antagonise or excite other animals.
 
 
 The ban follows the launch of a new experience ‘ZUFARI: Ride Into Africa!’, which sees visitors journey off-road on a safari adventure.Since the launch of the 22-acre Serengeti-style trail, the zookeepers have noticed the wildlife ‘becoming puzzled’ when spotting visitors that look like them. Park spokeswoman Natalie Dilloway said, “Visitors get so close to wild species that if someone wears the same pattern to the animal’s coat they can become over-friendly.“
 
 “If they wear the pattern of its predator, it has the opposite effect and the animals become afraid and run away. Possibly the worst thing you could do is limp past the lion or tiger enclosure in a zebra print outfit,” she added.
