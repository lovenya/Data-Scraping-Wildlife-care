The Bannerghatta Biological Park welcomed two Gaur calves recently. Indian Bison/ Gaur are the largest member of the cattle family, distributed across South and South East Asia occurring in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia.
 
They are largely confined to evergreen, semi-evergreen, and moist deciduous forest but are also found in the dry deciduous and thorny forest. Habitat fragmentation and poaching have reduced Gaur numbers to approximately 6,000 – 21,000 in the wild.
 
To protect this species from extinction they are listed under “Schedule I” of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 in India and listed “Vulnerable” by IUCN Redlist globally. In captivity, zoos play a major role in Ex-situ Conservation by breeding gaurs under conservation breeding program and enhancing their number.
 
Currently, 10 Gaurs are housed in a semi-captive condition within an extent of 68 ha in the Herbivore safari along with other herbivores such as deer and antelopes.
