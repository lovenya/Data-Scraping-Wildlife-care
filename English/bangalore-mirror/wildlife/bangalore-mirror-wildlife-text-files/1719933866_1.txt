The incident took place on Kammanahalli Main Road near the Shabari fruit stall at around 5 pm on Dec 12, when Matthew, who has been into wildlife research earlier, was walking to his brother-in-law’s house. 

                                 Mathew shows the stiches on his head          “I left my car and decided to walk to my relative’s place. 

I was walking on the right side of Kammanahalli Road when a red Maruti 800 (KA 01 M 2068) came from the wrong side 
and ran over my feet. The driver was talking on his mobile. 

I knocked on the rear of the vehicle with my umbrella and screamed at him,” Matthew said.

But instead of apologising, the driver, a local realtor named Raju, started abusing him. “He kept sitting in his car and abused me in Kannada,” Matthew said. As he walked away in disgust, the man followed him, snatched his umbrella and hit him on the head, causing it to bleed. Not enough, he took out his belt and started belabouring Matthew. A big crowd had gathered by then but none came forward to help Matthew. “He was smaller, and I was holding on to his collar. Finally, one person came forward to help me, and I dragged my assailant back to his car and tried to take him to the police station. But he managed to escape, though not before warning me not to go to the police,” Matthew said. 

Matthew was treated for his injuries at a private hospital and is getting his wind back from his sudden encounter with an urban form of wildlife. He has lodged a complaint with the Banaswadi police, who say the assailant is absconding.
