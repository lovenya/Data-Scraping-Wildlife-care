Sleuths of the CID’s forest cell, who had seized 50 red-eared slider turtles from a man who was trying to sell them at a bakery under Kengeri police limits on May 22, can now heave a sigh of relief.Declaring the species as “invasive and dangerous”, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Deepak Sarmah on Tuesday passed an order to keep them in isolation under supervision for lifetime. Of the 50 turtles seized, only 33 are now surviving. Following the seizure, the CID forest cell sleuths had booked Lawrence Xavier under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act for keeping them in his possession.
   Meanwhile, the forest department officials said their release in local ponds could have proved a threat to aquatic and human lives as they eat up aquatic animals. 
   Considering the gravity of issue, the wildlife top brass directed the officials to release these turtles into an isolated water body at Bannerghatta Biological Park and to be kept under supervision for their lifetime. 
   Wildlife expert Sharath R Babu said: “This is a welcome move. It has sent a clear message on the release of invasive species like this. The department has prevented a huge damage from happening.”
