Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on a safari at Bandipur National Park in Karnataka on Sunday.

Clad in casuals and donning a hat, PM Modi travelled in an open jeep for one-and-a-half hours and spotted tiger and other wild animals.

Nine convoy vehicles followed his jeep in the jungle, authorities said. PM Modi started his safari from Bandipur campus and traversed about 12 kms in the deep jungles. He went to Bolagudda hill area which offers a spectacular view of the Bandipur National Park.

Earlier in the day, he arrived at the Melukamanahalli helipad in the hilly Nilgiris district in a special chopper and travelled to Bandipur.

The Tiger Project in Bandipur National Park has emerged as one of the prime habitats of tigers in the world.

As a model code of conduct is in place in the state, BJP leaders did not get the opportunity to welcome PM Modi. Authorities welcomed him at the Mandakalli airport in Mysuru on Thursday night and also at the Melukanahalli helipad.

He arrived in Mysuru on Saturday late evening to take part in celebrations to mark the 50 years of ‘Project Tiger’.

‘Moment of pride’
The Prime Minister said India did not believe in conflict between ecology and economy but gave importance to coexistence between the two.

Protection of wildlife was a universal issue, Modi said, launching the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA) that endeavours to protect and conserve big cats.

Citing data that showed the tiger population in India stood at 3,167 in 2022, Modi said: “The tiger numbers that we have reached shows that this family of ours is growing. This is a moment of pride.”

Stating that India has not only saved tigers, but created an ecosystem for it to flourish, he said, “India is a country where protecting nature is part of culture.”
