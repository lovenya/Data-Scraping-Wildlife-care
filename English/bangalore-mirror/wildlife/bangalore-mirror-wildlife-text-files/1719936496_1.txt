The inauspicious month of ‘Ashada’ is dotted with several kite flying events across the state and it poses considerable threat to the avian population of the IT city. With several kite flyers using the deadly ‘Chinese manja’ to help their kites soar greater heights, severed and free flying threads often result in injuries to birds, especially pigeons and hawks. That will now chance as, after six years of fight by animal right activists, the state government on Wednesday officially banned the sale, possession and use of Chinese manja across Karnataka.
 
 
 	Announcing the ban, Ramanatha Rai, minister for environment, forest and ecology said, “The manja threads, which are non-biodegradable and coated with glass powder, remains in the air for a long time due to its light weight. There have been several incidents involving birds dying because of this. Considering this, the government has decided to enforce a complete ban on these threads.”
 	
 	  	The Union government too recently had written to all states to consider banning the use of the Chinese manja. According to the ban order: “No person including shopkeeper, vendor, wholesaler, retailer or trader shall procure, stock, sell and use the Chinese manja or Chinese dor coated with harmful glass used for kite flying.”
 	
 	Enough powers were given to forest and horticulture officials of BBMP and scientific officers of the KSPCB to initiate action against offenders under the Karnataka Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.
