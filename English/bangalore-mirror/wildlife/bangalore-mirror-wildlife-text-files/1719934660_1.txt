Climbing Jog falls could soon be barred with the tourism department issuing new guidelines for adventure sports. The draft guidelines issued by the department clearly states, “No one should attempt to do rappelling, rock climbing or any other adventure activities near waterfalls.”   Waterfalls in the state have been a big draw for youngsters, especially from the techie community, to indulge in adventure activities. However, over the years, there have been fatal accidents around several of these tourist spots. There has also been widespread demand to draft rules and regulations for adventure sports ever since a bungee jumper died during an act in 2009.    After ignoring the issue for years, the state government seems to have finally woken up to the fact and has banned adventure sports near water bodies.   It has also formulated guidelines for adventure sports. As per the guidelines, organisers must provide insurance covering third party liability as well as for instructors and staff.    The organisers must ensure the availability of first-aid kits and treatment at the activity area. Participants and organisers must adhere to wildlife ethics and no participant should resort to activity without the necessary guidance.    The organisers must obtain permission from forest officials before renting the activity area. The organisers must also ensure sound training in adventure sports for instructors from recognised government and private institutes.     Some activities spared Some activities that have been excluded from the definition of adventure activities include driving or being driven on a public road, use of a passenger ropeway or an amusement device, cycle tour that is not isolated, land-based fishing that is not isolated, tramping or hiking, skiing, snowboarding, sledging, ice-skating besides water sports outside specified waters.
