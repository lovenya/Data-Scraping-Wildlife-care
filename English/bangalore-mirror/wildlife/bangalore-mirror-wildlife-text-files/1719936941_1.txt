Adding to the list of tiger mortality in the reserves, another big cat was found dead in Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary limits on Friday.
 
 The mysterious death of the male tiger increases the toll to 13 within a year. Sources in Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) revealed that department personnel, who were on regular patrolling, found the carcass of a tiger at Hebbe Range of Sangameshwara Division.
 
 A senior official of the KFD said that they are yet to ascertain the exact cause of the death. “It appears the tiger may have died 3-4 days ago as the body is completely decomposed. We will send the samples to veterinary experts for examination,” explained the officer. Chief conservator of forest, Vijay Mohan Raj, visited the spot and took stock of the situation. 
 
 Conservationists argue that tiger mortality has been on steady rise in Karnataka owing acute shortage of food and water. They are scared that the deaths might hamper Karnataka’s reputation of having largest number of tigers in the state. 
 
 A few days ago, a one-year-old tiger was stranded and rescued later near Nagarahole Reserve. Experts opined that the tiger may have strayed out of forest area in search of food.
 
 It may be recalled that KFD officials had nabbed a gang of poachers on the New Year’s eve in Bhadra. While deaths of tigers have been reported from Bandipur, Nagarahole, this is for the first time that Bhadra Tiger Reserve has reported tiger’s death.
