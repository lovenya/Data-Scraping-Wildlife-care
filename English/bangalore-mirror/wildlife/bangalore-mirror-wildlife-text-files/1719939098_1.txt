For Korlakunta Jayasimha Rao, 65, retirement gave him the chance to turn to art, once more.
 
A resident of Cooke Town, Jayasimha’s tryst with art began when he was growing up in his home town Nandalur in Cuddapah district. “I was inspired by local artists creating beautiful artwork using charcoal and colour chalk pieces on the streets and walls. I started drawing and sketching when I was not even 10 and in high school, my brother Korlakunta Subramanyam encouraged me to participate in competitions and that’s when I started gaining recognition,” he reminisces fondly.
 
In the early 90s, Rao started doing oil paintings and water colours for about two years with no formal training. However, soon his hobbies took a backseat because work became a priority. “I could not spare any time for artwork because of my busy office schedule and responsibilities,” he adds.
 
Now, I can spare time and I am currently focusing on improving my basic skills of drawing and sketching. I dabble in all varieties of subjects: plein-air painting, still life, wildlife and figure drawing. My favourite mediums are oil painting and water colours,” he says.
 
The sexagenarian is now planning to bring out a series of artwork on everyday life images: marketplace, bustling railway station, local park etc. followed by another series of portraits on ordinary people.
 
An out-and-out family man, the 65-year-old lives with his elder daughter and son-in-law, and when not painting, he dotes on his granddaughters Geethasri and Akshara.
