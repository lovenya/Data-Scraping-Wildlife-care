Animal activists raised the pitch of protests against the killing of tigress Avni on Sunday. Posters of those involved in the killing of the tigress in Yavatmal on were burnt outside the office of National Tiger Conservation Authority in Bengaluru. 

The 32-hour protest kicked off outside the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s office around 11 am on Saturday. Around 200 people protested throughout the day and even camped outside the office through the night. The protest started as a silent one on November 17 and ended with a forceful show of anger on Sunday evening. 

Mini Misson, a protestors, said, “We have come across a recording of a telephonic conversation in Marathi that allegedly is of a person who stays near Yavatmal district. The person is talking about how they want the cubs to be killed too because if the mother was a man-eater, the cubs will turn out to be man-eater too. In the conversation, we made out that they want the cubs to die of hunger naturally so that it won’t bring a controversy.”

Protests were intensified after activists saw there was no action on the gunning down of the tigress. The activists demand the resignation of Sudhir Mungantiwar, Cabinet Minister of Finance & Planning and Forests departments in the government of Maharashtra, AK Mishra, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) in Maharashtra and the cancellation of the licence of sharp shooter Shafat Ali Khan, who shot the tigress.

The activists said that in the post mortem report of the slain tigress, no trace of human hair or teeth could be found that could prove that Avni was a man-eater. They demanded immediate tracing and securing of the cubs with the video of it to prove the same.
