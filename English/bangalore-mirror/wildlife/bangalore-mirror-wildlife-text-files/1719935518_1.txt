Who is a tourist? According to World Tourism Organisation, a tourist is one who travels to and stay in places outside their usual environment for more than 24 hours and not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited.
 	
 	So, if your tourism credentials fall into this category, then you can explore the road less travelled near Topslip. This is one of the lesser-known hill stations near Coimbatore when one can enjoy the lap of nature. In fact, many animal/bird lovers in Bengaluru religiously go to this place to get the best animal sightings.
 	  	Located at 800 feet above sea level, Topslip lies in the Anamalai mountain ranges (At an altitude of 1,400 metres above sea level, Anamalai wildlife sanctuary is considered as an ecological paradise and recently renamed as Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park). It is home to some of the most endangered birds and animals. 
 The forest department offers a number of trekking trails like the pugmark trail where visitors can track the pugmarks of the tiger. If you are lucky enough, you can sight dholes, leopards, elephants, gaurs, Nilgiri langurs, slender lorises, Indian giant squirrels, peacocks and so on.
 	  	The place also has great hotels. Upma is generally a hated food when cooked at home. But the upmas which you get at some hotels here are the most sought after. Even the malabar parota and bread parota draw tourists to the hotels here.
 	  	The place is also known for tree houses. You can stay on these houses located on the banks of nearby lakes.
 	  	The best part is the drive to these mountains that form a scenic backdrop. In fact, the picturising of many dance sequences in Kannada, Telugu and Tamil films happens at locations here.
