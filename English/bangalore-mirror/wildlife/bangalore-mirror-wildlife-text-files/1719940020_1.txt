Arrival of baby elephant at Bannerghatta Biological Park has stirred excitement among both visitors and staff; Mysuru welcomes gorilla from Frankfurt

The Bannerghatta Biological Park is brimming with excitement as it welcomes a delightful new addition—a baby boy elephant calf. This adorable arrival brings the elephant count in the Bannerghatta zoo to a total of 26, eliciting joy not only among the visitors but also among the dedicated staff. Both the mother and the newborn are receiving special attention and care to ensure their well-being. The elephant calf, weighing between 120 and 130 kg, adds a heartwarming charm to the zoo’s vibrant atmosphere.

Meanwhile, in Mysuru, a novel attraction awaits visitors—the gorilla enclosure spanning an impressive 37,000 square feet. This expansive enclosure provides a unique opportunity for visitors to observe gorillas up close. While many enthusiasts typically travel to African countries for such experiences, Mysuru has become a standout destination, being the only zoo in the entire country where gorillas can be observed. The gorilla in Mysuru was brought from Frankfurt, adding an international flair to the zoo’s diverse wildlife collection.

In another development, a male giraffe has been relocated to Hampi’s Atal Bihari Vajapayee zoo to serve as a companion for a patiently waiting female giraffe. This move makes Hampi Zoo the exclusive zoo in North Karnataka to house giraffes. Currently, Bengaluru and Mysuru zoos are the only other locations in the state with giraffes. The four-year-old female giraffe in Hampi was previously brought from Patna, Bihar.

Meanwhile, a 1.5-year-old girl was injured when a battery-operated vehicle hit her in Bannerghatta zoo. The girl has been admitted to a private hospital.

Reduction in migratory birds
Furthermore, ornithologists and bird watchers have been complaining about the reduction of migratory birds visiting lakes in and around Bengaluru due to climate change. Sources said that this year has brought unprecedented manifestations of climate change, particularly evident in the altered weather patterns across various regions. Northern areas, such as Gulmarg and Auli, are experiencing a scarcity of snowfall, contributing to concerns about the changing climate. Another distressing observation is the decline in the number of migratory birds visiting locations in and around Bengaluru. Well-known bird habitats like Kokkare Bellur, Doddaballapur, Ranganathittu, and Channapatna Lake usually witness a significant influx of migratory birds by the end of October, with their departure in March. As January concludes, the usual throng of visitors is notably absent this time, with only a few lakes hosting diminished numbers of winged guests.

A senior official said, “In comparison to previous years, the bird population has decreased, and we believe that climate change is a contributing factor.” Locals in these areas have also observed the challenges faced by the birds in locating prey and securing food resources.
