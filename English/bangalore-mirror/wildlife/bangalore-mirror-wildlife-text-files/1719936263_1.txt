The escape of the leopard from the rescue centre of Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) has brought the spotlight on the concentration of animals at the park. The rescue centre nestled inside the BBP is the only referral centre in the state to house rescued leopards. They are sent to BBP for rehabilitation and treatment. 
 
 
 	With the incidents of leopard-human conflict increasing in recent times, more and more numbers of leopards are being sent to BBP.
 	
 	  	Sources in BBP revealed that there are already 21 leopards at the rescue centre excluding the escaped leopard. All 21 leopards were captured and rescued from various parts of the state. 
 	
 	  	A senior BBP officer told Mirror that the since the leopard enclosure was crowded, the leopard rescued from Vibgyor High was kept inside a tiger enclosure.
 	
 	  	Keeping in mind the high number of leopards at BBP, the Zoo Authority of Karnataka had planned to invest Rs 3 crore to start a dedicated leopard safari at the BBP. The project is still in the drawingboard stage.
 	
 	  	Capturing of leopards will always be the last option in any rescue attempt. Similarly, re-release of captured leopards is also a decision that the chief wildlife warden of the state takes based on the behaviour of the animal.
 	
 	
 	How the leopard escaped
 	
 	
 	 		* The inner side of a leopard fencing is faced with metal sheets, and an inward-facing overhang to prevent the animal from scaling heights
 		
 		
 		 			* The leopard that escaped was kept in the tiger enclosure which is devoid of the metal overhang
