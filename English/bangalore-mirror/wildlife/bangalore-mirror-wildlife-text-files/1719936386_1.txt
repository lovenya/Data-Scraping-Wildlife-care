It’s a jungle out there and it is not always easy surviving as a forest officer. With odd work hours and often being made to stay away from families, jobs in the forest department are not exactly in demand, and as a result, the Bandipur National Park and Tiger Reserve is facing a keen staff crunch. 
 
 	
 	Officials say there is a shortage of nearly 40%. An official said, “Unless one has the passion and interest in wildlife, it is difficult to stay in remote ranges, often disconnected from families. Tribal groups are moving to cities.” ACF of the tiger reserve, DA Maradimani, said that out of the sanctioned strength of 341, only 222 posts have been filled. 
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	  	There are 13 ranges in Bandipur, of which 872.24 sq km is the core area and 147.97 sq km is the buffer zone. Maradimani explained that despite staff shortage, there has been reduction in the man-animal conflict level due to the various mitigation measures.
 	
 	  	Steps taken for mitigation of conflict include 217.50km of solar fencing, 28.50km elephant-proof trenches and 21 multipurpose solar sheds to house solar power fence systems. Anti-depredation camps have been deployed, round-the-clock perambulation, chilli smoke in elephant entrance spots and a flying squad for human-elephant conflict mitigation have been ensured at the national park.
