Snake catchers in the city are having a busy time as the rain not only brought in water into people’s homes, but also dragged in snakes.

Snake Mohan, one of the most popular snake catchers in the city, managed to rescue six snakes from the flood-affected areas. A resident from HBR layout, in the fifth block, was shocked to see a tail hanging from his car’s engine. He sent a message to Snake Mohan, who was able to identify and rescue the snake. “It was a cobra and I managed to rescue it. In the same area, one snake was found in a building compound, while another was spotted hanging from a tree in Banaswadi,” Snake Mohan said.

Rajesh, a wildlife rescuer, said that he too received several calls from the rain-affected areas, complaining about snakes. “We rescued three checkered Keelbacks from the Singapura Layout. They had been washed into the settlements due to the excess rainwater. In the last two days, my team and I have rescued at least 15 snakes, which include Russel’s vipers and cobras. 

Most of these snakes have been rescued from homes. In Vidyaranyapura, due to heavy rainfall, a rat snake had fallen into a sump, but thankfully, it has been rescued,” explained Rajesh. In Shanti Layout, a resident grew suspicious after seeing a dog continuously bark looking in one direction. Upon inspection, they spotted a cobra and immediately called Rajesh, who was able to rescue the serpent.
