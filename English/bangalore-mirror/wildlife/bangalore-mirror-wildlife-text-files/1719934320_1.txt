Determined to relocate rogue elephants which are damaging crops and property in the Western Ghats, the forest department has learnt techniques from experts in Kenya and South Africa to get a stay on the operation imposed by the High Court of Karnataka vacated. 
 The government had decided to move about 35 jumbos located in small forest areas in Hassan district to the Kaveri Wildlife Sanctuary about a month ago. However, acting on a petition, the HC had imposed a stay. The department has now obtained opinions and techniques from experts in Kenya and South Africa which will be presented in the hearing on Dec 5. C P Yogeshwar, forest minister, said, “We hope to convince the HC with all the reports we have obtained from various parts of the world. Our officers had travelled abroad to find a solution to this problem. They have returned with expert opinions. After convincing the court we will take up the relocation task in December as decided.” 
 According to sources, Kenya and S Africa have a population of more than 80,000 elephants, but at least 80 per cent roam outside protected areas. This has resulted in man-animal conflicts. To end the problem, those governments too had decided to shift the animals. 
 B K Singh, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said, “I had been to several places in South Africa and Kenya where similar techniques were used. Ajay Desai, an eminent expert on elephants, gave us a report which states that these elephants have no future as they have severe genetic problems. It is better if they are captured and relocated.”
   Meanwhile, the government is also pursuing other measures. It has decided to buy 2,300 acres of coffee estate and 13,000 acres of revenue land in order to create an elephant corridor. This is to facilitate easy movement of jumbos and to protect crops and plantations located near forest areas.
