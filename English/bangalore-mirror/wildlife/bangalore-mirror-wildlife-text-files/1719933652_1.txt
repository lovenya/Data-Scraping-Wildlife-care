After helping solve many a murder mystery, DNA tests are now being done on animal skins to nail poachers. For the first time in Karnataka, DNA tests done on otter pelts have helped police identify the species of otters poached. This information will help them zero in on the habitat of these animals, and in turn, lead to the poachers.

The forest cell of state police seized 36 otter pelts some time ago. They found it difficult to ascertain to which otter species the pelts belonged to since all the three species found in India - Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), Smooth-coated otter (Lutra perspicillata), and Oriental small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea) - look identical. These three species are protected in India under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Out of total fur trade in India, nearly 30 per cent is in otter skins alone. 

Police hit upon the idea of DNA tests on these pelts to identify which otter species they belonged to. Pelt samples were sent to the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore. Scientists at NCBS subjected these samples to polymer chain reaction to get several copies of the DNA structure of each animal. These results were compared with other samples at the centre. 

Out of 36 otter pelts, 20 were found out to be of Oriental small-clawed otter, while 16 were of the Smooth-coated otter. 

“We thought if this method can be used for investigating human bodies, then why not for animal skins. But we never knew results will be so precise,” said K S N Chikkerur, former head of CID Forest Cell and currently the chief of Karnataka Railway Police. “This time, it was just otter. Soon, a tiger skin will be sent for DNA tests. We want to use more of such scientific tests to solve crime,” he added.
