  Draws censure online for holding cub in front of camera
 
 A pose for the camera has landed a senior zoo official in Mysuru in trouble. Mysuru zoo authority Director Mallige Veeresh posed for the camera with a leopard cub in hand, an the pictures have caused a flutter all over.
 
 The pictures have now become the talk of town as many objected to her for holding a leopard cub, which is illegal, according to the Wildlife Protection Act. Mallige Veeresh uploaded the picture on WhatsAp, forcing many social media users to troll her for the act.
 
 Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Veeresh said, “That picture was taken 8 months back. I had been to Bellary zoo a few months ago and there I saw this little leopard cub. It was two-and-a-half months old at that time and it had lost its mother during birth”.
 
 As it came running towards me, I picked it in my arms. Without my knowledge, one of the staff belonging to Bellary zoo clicked my photo while holding that cub. As you can observe in that picture, I was not looking towards the camera. So there is no question of me posing for the camera”.
 
 “Yes, I know it’s a violation of law, but it was not intentional. The photo was just clicked without my knowledge. I was really surprised to see the staffer presenting
 me the photo, framed. So I put that picture on Whatsapp. I request users on social media not to make it a big issue as I love animals and only showed that I care.
 
 Wildlife Activist Sanjay Gubbi told Mirror, “We may call it as cruelty to animals only when someone tortures animals for the sake of pictures. But it’s nowhere mentioned in the Wildlife Protection Act that posing for the camera with animals is an offence. It will be called cruelty only when animals are tortured.”
