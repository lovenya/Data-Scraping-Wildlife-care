One thing is certain, Bengaluru has a soft spot for birds. The sight of a seemingly injured and helpless barn owl lodged high among the branches of a big tree there had residents of Coffee Board Layout in Veeranapalya near Nagavara of North Bengaluru calling the fire and emergency services department to rescue it. 	
 	When a resident of the area noticed the struggling bird flapping its wings but unable to move on Saturday, he decided he had to do something to help the ‘poor thing’. Since the owl was perched at an inaccessible height, “I could not climb up to it,” narrated Jagdish. 	
 	He did, though, create enough commotion in his attempt because of which a large crowd soon gathered. Each one in the crowd offered to do their bit to rescue the bird. The height at which the bird was stuck apart, live electricity wires at the spot put paid ideas they may have harboured of reaching and releasing the owl. One of them decided that the operation was best entrusted to professionals, and so called the fire department.
 	  	A fire engine from the nearby Banaswadi Fire Station was rushed to the spot, and with the help of a hydraulic ladder, department rescuers climbed up to it and brought the owl down. The relieved crowd applauded their effort. 	
 	“We could not rescue the injured owl because of the electric wires around it, so we alerted the fire services who came within a few minutes. In about half-an-hour, the fire department executed there plan and rescued the bird,” the youth said. 	
 	Firefighter BM Shekhar, who helped in the rescue operation, said the bird may have injured itself and got trapped in the branches. “We received a call around 9 am from residents of the area about a bird needing to be rescued, as it was stuck in the branches of a tree. We rushed to the spot and brought down the bird. It was not badly injured. It could not move as it could not see in the daylight. We handed it over to the wildlife department. They will take care of it,” he said.
