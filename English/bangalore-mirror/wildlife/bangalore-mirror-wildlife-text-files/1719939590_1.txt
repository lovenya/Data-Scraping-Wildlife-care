A team from People for Animals (PFA) successfully rescued and rehabilitated an adorable Eurasian hoopoe chick, giving it a second chance at life. After two months of providing care and support to the bird, it was recently released back into the wild.

The Eurasian hoopoe, known for its striking plumage and distinctive crest, has found a welcoming home in various habitats across India, ranging from forests to grasslands and even urban areas. Despite its adaptability, the species faces challenges due to habitat loss and degradation, making conservation efforts vital to its survival.

Chief veterinarian Col. Dr Navaz Sharif said, “Recently, a tiny hoopoe chick was discovered stranded and alone in the wild, in need of urgent care and attention. Our veterinarian was on leave. Dr Darshan had spotted the bird in Mandya, and we rescued it. The PFA team sprang into action, swiftly rescuing the chick and bringing it to their shelter. There, they meticulously monitored its condition and provided round-the-clock care for two months.”

To ensure the chick’s well-being, it was placed in an incubator where its body temperature was carefully regulated. During the initial weeks, the chick received a diet of small worms, gradually transitioning to adult worms as it grew stronger and healthier. Thriving under the PFA team’s dedicated care, the chick quickly adapted to its new surroundings.

Dr Navaz added, “The chick’s successful release back into the wild highlights the importance of wildlife conservation.”
