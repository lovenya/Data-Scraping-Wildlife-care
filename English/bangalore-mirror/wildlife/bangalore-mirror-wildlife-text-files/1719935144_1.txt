To every dog lover, who suffers at the sight of dead and abandoned dogs on city roads, here is some heart-warming news for the New Year. A first-of-its-kind free burial service to abandoned dead strays will begin from this January 1 as snake rescuer Mohan K, 38, after 16 years of wildlife rescue, is all set to start it. 

 He plans to bury the dogs in reserve forests of Hebbal, Nagavara and Kasturinagar. Currently a post warden with division 43 of the civil defence, Mohan has so far rescued more than 10,000 snakes and over 300 birds and other wildlife. He will start the burial initiative in a 33-km Mahadevpura – Banaswadi – Hebbal stretch, where at least two dogs die everyday. After roping in volunteers, the service will be extended in phases across the city. 

 	 		“We see several dogs lying dead after accidents on city roads with busy traffic. There is nobody to attend to them. We will be starting the service to clear such remains from roads. The remains, when fresh, may lead to diseases and additional deaths of birds that fly down to feed on them,” Mohan told Bangalore Mirror. 	

 	 		One of civil defence’s 12 services – corpse disposal -- inspired him start it. “The burial service has many aspects to it. These dogs when buried in the forest, also add to the fertility of soil. Further clearing them every morning makes the roads free and prevents accidents which may occur when two-wheelers pass,” Mohan pointed out. 	

 	 		"We come across dead dogs every day. With heavy traffic flow, we can't stop our vehicles and come back to attend to it. The authorities are least bothered. This is a welcome initiative and will certainly prevent accidents that may occur when trying to avoid the remains," Seetharam Vishwanath, who was formerly with Outer Ring Road Companies Association, said.
