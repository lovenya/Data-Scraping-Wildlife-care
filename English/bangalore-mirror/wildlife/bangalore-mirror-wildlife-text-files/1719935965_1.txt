Hyderabad:  Movement of two to three baby tigers (cubs) in the forests in Adilabad district brought cheers among the forest officials, at a time when India is worried about shrinking forests.
 
 Some tigers, which had strayed into Maharashtra and Chattisgarh forests due to disturbance to their natural habitat here are also believed to have returned, indicating improvement in their habitat conditions.
 
 Chief wildlife warden PK Sharma revealed this saying, “We are now launching measures to continue the tempo and increase the numbers in Amrabad and Kawal tiger reserves in Adilabad district bordering Maharashtra.
 
 The department had already obtained sanction from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to recruit two squads of tiger forces, each consisting 120 armed men. “These guards will be imparted training on par with para military forces and equipped with weapons to fight poachers and smugglers,” Sharma said.
 
 Apart from the new force to be recruited next month, the department had also got permission to equip the existing 83 range squads with arms including 303 rifles.
 
 The tiger population is put between 18 and 23 in Telangana, after bifurcation from Andhra Pradesh. “Though forests are divided on geographical lines, wildlife has no jurisdictions. They keep moving in search of food and comfort. Several tigers had earlier gone into Maharashtra forests, as the natural habitat here remained unfriendly to them. Now, some have returned,” he explained.
 
 The 2014 tiger census by the NTCA indicated increase of its population by 10 in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, compared to 2013. The tiger population fell down from an approximate 72 in 2010 to 68 in 2014 in both the states. The two states together can accommodate about 150 tigers in their forests, which are mostly hilly terrain.
 
 India has around 2226 tigers as of 2014 census.
