The forest department officials at Bandipur are ensuring this year’s Beladakuppe Mahadeshwara Swamy temple’s fair is conducted with utmost discipline, without harming the wildlife or littering inside the tiger reserve limits. The fair is held annually at the temple located inside the tiger reserve in Bandipur, with around three lakh visitors. Plays, cooking of food for devotees, commercial activities during the 3-day festival are common inside the park limits. However, once the festival is over, the park is littered with single use plastic and other waste in large quantities which is usually removed only 15-20 days later. To ensure discipline this time, the tiger reserve authorities have strict rules in place.

As directed by T Balachandra, Director of Bandipur tiger reserve, no commercial activities like selling of offering materials will be permitted inside the park premises. Private vehicles also will be allowed to ply inside the park during the festival. Instead, visitors will be ferried by 120 Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) vehicles.

Manjunath Hebbar, Range forest officer (RFO) Moliyur Range, Bandipur tiger reserve said, “Last year 60 buses were arranged, this year we doubled the number. We are arranging a parking space on rent for three days outside the park limits so that people can park their vehicles. We have also been creating awareness campaigns about the do’s and don’ts through loudspeakers currently in nearby villagers to make people aware. We are also installing CCTV cameras at various places.”

The department has also asked the temple trust to install about ten mobile toilets for the convenience of people. Ambulances too will be kept ready. The festival will be held from November 24th to 27th.
