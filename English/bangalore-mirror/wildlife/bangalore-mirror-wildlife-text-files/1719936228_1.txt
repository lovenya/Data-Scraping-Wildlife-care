Rescue efforts were hampered by the large crowd that gathered at the spot rubbernecking
 
 
 	High drama was witnessed at Vibgyor High School on Varthur Road almost all of Sunday when a leopard entered the school premises in the wee hours of the day. Wildlife expert Sanjay Gubbi and two school staffers sustained injuries when the packing leopard attacked them in a bid to make good an escape. 
 	
 	  	A security guard on duty spotted the leopard in the morning and alerted the police, who rushed to the school premises along with the forest department personnel. While officials felt fortunate that it was Sunday with no children in the school, they were worried as the school’s neighbourhood was densely populated and that the leopard could harm people if it escaped.
 	
 	  	Closer to dusk, while the forest personnel were busy trying to trap the leopard inside the school premises so as to prevent it from escaping and harming anyone, the police were kept busy trying to chase the crowd away. The increasing desperation was due to the fading lights. The officials knew it would be increasingly difficult to trap the wild cat in the dark.
 	
 	  	However, it was only around 8.30 pm that the forest personnel were able to tranquilise the leopard inside the school’s swimming pool toilet. The leopard is being looked after at the Bannerghatta Biological Park.
