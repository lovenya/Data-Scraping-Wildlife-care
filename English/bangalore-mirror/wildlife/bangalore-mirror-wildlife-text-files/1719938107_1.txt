HC orders release of alleged poacher as police did not see him committing the crime

The High Court has ordered the release of an alleged poacher because the police did not see him in the act. The wildlife authorities had arrested another person and claimed two others ran away from the scene of the crime. They did not know the identities of the persons who allegedly ran away. Based on the statement of the one person they managed to capture, two others were arrested.

Abhilash, a 32-year-old from Byndoor in Udupi approached the HC for anticipatory bail. The Byndoor range forest authorities alleged that when they were on the rounds in Byndoor Forest Range, they found three persons hunting a Sambar deer on May 9, 2019. After seeing the wildlife personnel, two of the three ran away from the spot. Only one was apprehended. A carcass of a Sambar deer and one knife was recovered. 

The arrested person allegedly disclosed the involvement of other two persons (who ran away). Abhilash is allegedly one of two who ran away from the spot.

It is not that police have stated that they have actually seen accused No.2 and they could be able to identify him... the petitioner is entitled to be bail–The High Court

It is not that police have stated that they have actually seen accused No.2 and they could be able to identify him. Under the above circumstances, I am of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.” Allowing the petition, the HC ordered him to be released on bail in the event of his arrest the case. He was directed to surrender before the Investigating officer within ten days and execute a personal bond for Rs 50,000.
