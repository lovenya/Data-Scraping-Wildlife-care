192 people surrendered illegal wildlife parts, 115 of these from Bengaluru

Based on the number of items surrendered, it seems Bengaluru tops the list of those possessing illegal wildlife parts. Out of 192 individuals who have turned in wildlife parts to the forest department, 115 are from Bengaluru alone. Additionally, 15 are from Shivamogga, 13 from Sirsi, eight from Dharwad, six from Hassan, and five each from Mysuru, Belagavi, Tumakuru, and Haliyal. Four individuals from Honnavar have also handed over wildlife parts, among others.

The state government’s deadline for returning wildlife parts such as tiger claws, skins, elephant tusks, and deer horns has passed, leading to the forest department acquiring a large cache of confiscated items worth crores of rupees. Within 21 forest ranges across the state, 192 individuals have handed over illegally obtained wildlife parts, including tiger claws, to the authorities. Recently, a high-profile tiger claw case generated considerable attention, revealing that many celebrities, including film actors, politicians, and spiritual leaders, were unlawfully in possession of these items. Consequently, the forest department has been flooded with complaints about the illegal possession of various wildlife parts.

A forest department official said, “The state government had issued a notification under the Wildlife (Karnataka) Rules-2024, offering a three-month window (until April) for individuals to return illegally obtained wildlife parts and trophies. In support of this initiative, the forest department issued a circular directing all divisional forest officers, assistant forest officers, and range forest officers to accept and seize such items.”

The official said this effort aligns with the Wildlife Conservation and Protection Act, which prohibits the possession and trade of wildlife parts and trophies. “The state government and the forest department aim to retrieve wildlife parts and trophies from individuals who had obtained them illegally.
 
By providing a specified period for voluntary returns and ensuring enforcement through forest department officers, the initiative seeks to uphold the laws designed to protect wildlife and prevent illegal trade and possession of wildlife parts.
 
This initiative gained public attention, especially with high-profile cases involving celebrities and politicians found with tiger claws, highlighting the importance of strict enforcement and compliance with wildlife protection regulations.”

Possessing wildlife parts, such as tiger claws and elephant tusks, without a valid ownership certificate is a punishable offence under the Wildlife Conservation Act of 1972. The government has mandated that anyone found in possession of such items must surrender them to the forest department, warning that failure to comply will result in legal action.

Those who have surrendered these items will not face legal repercussions, but those who continue to illegally possess wildlife parts will be prosecuted. “Items made from tiger skin, tiger claws, and wild boar horns, worth millions of rupees, have been surrendered to the forest department. In Bengaluru alone, over 110 wildlife parts, including tiger skins and claws, have been turned in.
 
Across the state, 192 individuals have surrendered wildlife parts, with the highest number of surrenders coming from Bengaluru. The forest department has taken possession of these items, which include tiger skin and claw pendants, and wild boar horn decorations,” added an official.
