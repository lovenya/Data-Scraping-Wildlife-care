After a Bangalore Mirror report on July 24, a black buck and spotted deer that were kept in confinement for several months were finally freed at the Bannerghatta herbivore safari on Friday. 

 	“It was a nice experience as they were happy to run away when released in the herbivore safari. We hope they will do well with the kind of environment there,” said Avinash Krishnan, city wildlife volunteer in the release team. 

 	Bangalore Mirror in its report, Uncleared files keep black buck, deer in dirty toilet for months, July 24, had brought to light how red-tapism had ended in confinement of a black buck (protected under schedule I of Indian Wildlife Protection Act) and spotted deer (protected under schedule III of Indian Wildlife Protection Act) in the backyard of Hoskote range forest office. 

 	Though the two were rescued in two separate instances, they were confined to a dirty toilet in the backyard for several months as the range officials waited for permission from the brass to release them. 

 	Experts had feared this would land the two animals in serious trouble as the sensitive beings that had to be released in a conducive habitat either immediately after rescue or after the required treatment. They felt the animals were getting almost domesticated due to long stay. 

 	“Justice has been done to the animals. Had the release been delayed further, it would have put them in serious risk,” Sharath R Babu, former wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, told Bangalore Mirror.
