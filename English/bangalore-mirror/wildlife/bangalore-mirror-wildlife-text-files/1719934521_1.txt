We human beings have shown how heinous we can be every time we kill a baby that’s not of the ‘right’ gender, a senior citizen for the gold around his neck, or the woman who refuses to marry us. We may be all of that, but we are also capable of spending 22 hours to rescue a kite to safety.
 
 
 That’s what some 32 people did on Friday and Saturday, making it one of the longest rescue operations in recent times.  Wildlife volunteer Rajesh M got a call at around 3pm on Friday, saying that a pariah kite was stuck in a tree near Cunningham Road close to Jain hospital. On rushing to the spot, rescuers found the bird caught in a tree, thanks to the Chinese-made manja used to fly kites of the paper variety. The bird was stuck at a height of over 100 feet. Rescue was difficult since the tree stood on a sloping road. 
   Over 20 people, including local dwellers and wildlife volunteers, tried to initially rescue it using a 15-foot ladder. But the ladder was not tall enough. When it got dark, the rescue operation was postponed to Saturday. 
   Fire forces joined wildlife rescuers in the morning and a 50-foot ladder was pressed into service. Wildlife volunteers used the ladder to rescue the kite, to the cheers of the crowd below. By the time the operation was over, it was 1pm.
   The kite, which suffered a muscle tear, has been sent for treatment.
