Two poachers, who were trying to dispose of 30 kg of wildboar meat, were caught red-handed by the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) officials on Wednesday. The investigation started when locals informed the forest officials that wild boars were being illegally killed and their meat was being sold off to the locals. 

The accused, Veerabhadraiah, 40, and Siddaraju, 60, belong to Bidadi and are now in judicial custody along with three accomplices. AL Dalesh, Range Forest Officer for Ramanagara District, said, “We rarely come across such poachers. We got information about the illegal selling of meat from locals who had witnessed him doing so. We caught hold of him and filed a police complaint. He has been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act and was produced before the magistrate and is in judicial custody right now. Only licensed weapon holders are allowed to hunt wild boars outside forest areas as there is a huge population of wild boars but the accused was doing so illegally in forest areas close to Bidadi and he also possessed weapons. He used to supply the meat to locals.”

The Ramanagara police also seized a small gas cylinder, several knives, buckets, bags full of wild boar meat and stone weights from them. On Thursday, the Ramanagara police also visited their homes to check for other weapons illegally possessed by them but could not find any. According to officials, the poachers also possessed a gun illegally which they used for hunting wild boars. The police are still on the lookout for it.

Sharath Babu, who is an authorised official from KFD and expert, said, “We were aware of the illegal supply of wild boar meat since a couple of days but this time we tracked down the source. He was trying to dispose the meat to escape from the forest officials.”
