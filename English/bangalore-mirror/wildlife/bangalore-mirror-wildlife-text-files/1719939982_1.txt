After being directed by Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre to clear encroachments of forest land at the earliest, officials from the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) demolished a shed on Wednesday that was illegally constructed in the buffer zone of Turahalli Reserve forest near Kengeri.

KFD cleared 6.5 acres of forest of illegal encroachment and has taken over the land.

This was after the minister conducted a closed-door meeting with the officials from KFD on Tuesday.

“The encroachment of forest lands around Bengaluru should be cleared first. Increasing encroachments of forest land is one of the reasons behind higher human-wildlife conflict cases.
 
While the forest department has cleared nearly 2,000 acres of encroachment over the past three months, more needs to be done,” said Khandre during his meeting with KFD officials on Tuesday.

KFD officials were also asked to prepare a division-wise, circle-wise, and district-wise list of encroachments and decide the next course of action. On Wednesday, following the meeting, a team of more than 20 forest personnel demolished an illegally constructed shed in the buffer area of Turahalli Reserve and recaptured the land by planting saplings of various tree species.

“Madhusudhanananda Swamy had encroached upon about 6.5 acres of forest land in the forest area and had applied for sanction, which was rejected by the forest department, citing that the land cannot be allotted to anyone as it is forest land. In August 2017, the ACF ordered the removal of encroachments as the encroachers did not have any revenue document, sale deed, sanction letter, or cultivation slip in respect of the forest land. An appeal was filed in the CCF court challenging the order,” said a release from the Forest, Ecology and Environment Department of Karnataka.
