Hyderabad: Over 200 men including 80 policemen and 30 forest staff have been on a manhunt for a five-year-old girl who had gone missing from the Amrabad Tiger Reserve in Nallamala forest in Telangana’s Nagar Kurnool district, seven days ago. The search teams continue to remain clueless. Officials are now contemplating to deploy a special forest dog squad on Saturday as the last resort. The operation could not be carried out on Friday as it was raining heavily.

Two Chenchu (primitive) tribe girls strayed into the forest while playing in the open in their Mallapurpenta tribal hamlet in the forest on May 25. By the time they realised that they had lost their way in the forest, it was dark. They did not have food but had water from the special saucer pits arranged for the wildlife for summer. They then slept in the bushes. The next morning, the elder of the two girls (6) got up and tried to wake up Shravani (5). She was tired and wanted to sleep for some time. The elder girl was scared of being alone in the forest. She started walking on her own, clueless. As she came near a road, some Chenchu youths saw her moving alone and enquired. Based on her information, the youths searched for Shravani in the nearby forest but, there were no traces.

“The villagers alerted our staff. We formed teams involving 80 policemen, 30 forest staff, more than 50 NREGS (National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) workers and an equal number of local Chenchu youths who are familiar with the forest. They searched through the forest till Thursday. We did not get any clue. Even the high resolution CCTV cameras (trap cameras meant to track the movement of wildlife) did not provide us any clue about Shravani”, Nagar Kurnool divisional forest officer M Joji told Mirror. The teams could not venture into the forest because of adverse weather conditions.
