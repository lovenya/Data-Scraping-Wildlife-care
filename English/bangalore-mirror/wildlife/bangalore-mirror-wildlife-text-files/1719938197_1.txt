Mumbai: A spotted deer was run over by a speeding SUV belonging to Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Rajendra Gavit at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), forest officials said on Monday.

The incident occurred at around 5.45 PM on Thursday when a Toyota Fortuner MH 48 BH 9909, which is registered in the name of Gavit, ran over the deer, which was crossing the road near Tinmurti station (toy train station) area. The deer was part of a 3-4 member pack which was crossing the road, not far from the main entrance of the park. 

Chief Conservator of Forest and Director, SGNP, Anwar Ahmed, told Mirror Online. "The driver of the vehicle was arrested and booked under the relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. He was later released on cash bond." Ahmed said that the vehicle has been seized and an assistant conservator of forest rank official is presently conducting inquiry into the incident to find if it was a deliberate act or negligence on part of the driver.

Sources at the SGNP said that the driver had driven vehicle inside the park after dropping passengers, including Gavit, elsewhere in the city, when the incident occurred.

This was the 8th death of an animal inside the park in the last couple of years. "The killed animals mostly include monkeys," Ahmed said adding that in a majority of cases, rash driving has been the reason behind the accidents. In the peripheries of the park, as many as 9 leopards have been killed in road accidents in the last as many years.
 
Meanwhile, following the incident, the SGNP authorities have decided to put up more speed breakers and blinkers along the roads to prevent accidents. "We are launching a crackdown against drivers crossing the designated 20kph speed limit inside the park," Ahmed added.
