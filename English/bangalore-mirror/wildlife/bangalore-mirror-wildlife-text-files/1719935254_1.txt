Besides saving wildlife, V4Wildlife will work to bring all wildlife rescuers under one umbrella 

 A 20-year-old student from Mangalore has launched a trust to save wildlife and bring all wildlife rescuers under one umbrella. 

 	Adithya Puthraya aka ‘snake freak’ launched V4Wildlife on Feb 13. The snake freak tag comes from the fact that he has rescued over a thousand snakes. 

 	Puthraya got the idea of starting a trust while doing workshops in colleges, rescuing snakes and maintaining a small log book. “I realised that if we rescuers work in a more organised way, the impact would be greater. With guidance from my lecturers, especially the zoology department, I started V4Wildlife.” 

 	The first year BSc student at St Aloysius College is V4Wildlife’s managing director. The six other trustees include his teachers Vineet Kumar, Ashwini Vijaya, Godwin and Alban, and classmates Ganesh Prasad Kamath and Sneha Rao. 

 Puthraya says, “V4Wildlife will soon provide wildlife rescuers with ID cards. In the long run, we hope to cover them under a group insurance plan. We also aim to build a database of rescuers. This will help us alert the nearest rescuer when people inform us that a snake has been spotted. We will ask the government to provide us with anti-venom. At present only Wenlock Hospital stocks it in Mangalore. We want to preserve at least 12-15 vials of anti-venom for use in case of an emergency.” 

 	The trust has been conducting workshops and awareness programmes by taking up campaigns such as beach cleaning and watering saplings planted by the forest department. 

 	For now, V4Wildlife will focus on rescuing wild animals that can be released into the wild as it does not have facilities to shelter the animals. It also aims to start firm to organise trekking expeditions.
