All he requires is an order to deliver any number of statues, of any deity, made of ivory and sandalwood, at the doorstep at any point of time. The Wildlife Act, Forest Act, forest check-posts and state borders are no bar. 
 But Chennai-based Shivkumar Agarwal was caught in Hotel Atria on Monday with statues worth more than `7 lakh. He was trying to sell lord Ganesha statues made of ivory and sandalwood in Bangalore. Unlike the past two years, when he had been selling the statues to wealthy people, this time his ‘customers’ turned out to be CID sleuths (forest cell), officials said.  
 “Our sleuths trapped him on Monday,” M K Murali, Dy SP (forest cell) told Bangalore Mirror. “We had concrete information about him and the illegal trade he was into. Initially, he asked us to visit Chennai to buy statues. However, our sleuths, who posed as buyers, managed to convince him to come to Bangalore.”   
 The illegal trade Agarwal mostly dealt in Ganesha statues, but would cater to other requirements too. He went about his business claiming that the material was his ancestral property. He had come in a taxi from Chennai carrying statues of various deities, including Ganesha and Shiva-Parvati. 
 “We have seized statues. Three are made of ivory and one of sandalwood. Initially, Agarwal claimed that the statues were his ancestral property, but had no proof to substantiate his claim,” Murali added. 
   They have booked him for violating the Karnataka Forests Act and Indian Wildlife (protection) Act. Forest sleuths are probing if he has links with other smugglers and poachers in other parts of India. They are also investigating why cops posted on state borders failed to detect the contraband. “We will send an alert to border districts. Effective implementation of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act can check this illegal trade. We hope the investigation in this case will give us more leads,” Murali said.
