A baby macaque, not more than a month-old that had got trapped in a metal mesh of a balcony of a second-floor apartment in Basavanagudi, was rescued in the wee hours by fire personnel and volunteers from the People for Animals Hospital.
 
The macaque’s hind limbs were trapped in the mesh so the other monkeys in the troop including its mother waited for sometime, but they could not do much, so later they moved away. The baby macaque was crying bitterly through the night when a resident of the apartment, Mohan, called the animal rescue volunteers around 11.40 pm.
 
Wildlife rescuers Mohan Gowda, Mohammed Ashfak, and Salman Khan immediately set out to the rescue location and reached the spot at 1 am. They found that the monkey was trapped on the second floor, around 50 feet above ground level, so they informed the Fire and Emergency services. Within 10 to 15 minutes, a team of four fire-men came along with a fire-tender and only with the fire-truck ladder, they could access the balcony from where the macaque was safely rescued.
 
“The baby macaque had some kind of a spinal deformity, likely a spinal diverticulum and it was unable to stand and had no sensation in its hindlimbs which had gotten trapped in the mesh. The macaque did not have any fresh wounds except for the deformity. This needs prolonged treatment,” veterinary surgeon colonel Dr Navaz Sharif told BM.

Soon after the rescue, an animal lover posted about the incident on social media and there were all praises for the three PfA wildlife rescuers, and the four firemen identified as Vincent, Chandrashekarappa Madar, Shreenivasa, and Mallappa for reaching out during the wee hours to save a baby monkey’s life. The baby macaque has been named Gollu and will be rehabilitated with all care, veterinarians at PfA said.
