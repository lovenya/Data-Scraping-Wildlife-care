Wildlife sleuths were left with an egg on their face on Wednesday night when they found goats during a raid to rescue endangered spotted deer.
 
 A team of wildlife volunteers and CID forest cell descended on a chicken stall beside Leela Palace on Old Airport Road on Wednesday night, after they were tipped off that spotted deer were about to be slaughtered in the stall. Instead of spotted deer, they were met with three bleating goats.
 
 It all started with a phone call from a member of the public that spotted deer were seen at a chicken stall beside Leela Palace on Old Airport Road. The caller even alleged that stall had brought the endangered animals to sell their meat. Spotted deer are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972.
 
 Anticipating a big catch, wild life volunteers swung into action. They roped in officials of the CID forest cell officials. The volunteers then conducted a preliminary inquiry and ascertained that it was indeed deer that were present inside the chicken stall.
 
 
 ‘Our volunteers made the mistake’
 However, when 12 wildlife volunteers and CID forest cell officials descended on the stall, they were met with the bleats of an adult goat and two kids. Rajesh, a wildlife volunteer, said, “Our volunteers mistook the goats for spotted deer because it was dark. The goats had dark shaded skin and spots on them. The adult goat even had horns.”
 
 The embarrassed volunteers then informed the police team, which was on the way to join raid, to return.
