The column on Kaziranga national park in Assam (The fragile land; January 6) is a great piece of information, especially to someone like me who is aspiring to become an Indian Forest Service officer. The article not only gave important details about the Unesco world heritage site, but also served as an eye-opener about the failure of the system in preventing animal poaching and preventing losses. It was also delightful to know that Kaziranga holds 70 per cent of the world's population of the Indian one-horned rhino. It is a matter of great pride for the country. I hope that this fragile land will become the safest habitat for wildlife and aesthetics.   — Priyanka K
