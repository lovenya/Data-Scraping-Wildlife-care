Down with severe injuries on its leg and shoulder, Sidda, the 50-year-old pachyderm in the backwaters of Mancha­nabele reservoir close to Bengaluru, has finally managed to get the government’s attention.
 
 
 Coming to the rescue of the pachyderm, forest minister Ramanatha Rai on Monday told that his department personnel had been treating the elephant and would soon relocate it to Bannerghatta forests. Addressing reporters in Vidhana Soudha, Rai said, “Currently the department has ensured sufficient treatment to the elephant through a wildlife NGO. There have been severe injuries on its leg.
 
 
 Even though the animal did not cooperate initially for treatment, our staffs succeeded in providing it with medicines laced in food. Following its recovery, we will shift the elephant to Bannerghatta Forest.”
 
 
 Several wildlife volunteers from Bengaluru and local villagers had slammed the forest department’s inordinate delay in getting treatment to the animal. With pus oozing out of its multiple wounds a week ago, volunteers had launched a campaign to get urgent medical attention.
 
 
 Senior forest department officials told BM the moment matter was brought to their notice, officials had visited the spot. “We had constituted an expert committee to diagnose the elephant and suggest treatment methods. Based on the recommendations we have been treating the animal with the assistance by an NGO,” replied a senior officer.
 
 
 The forest department was also in a fix as it was not empowered to offer medical intervention to an ailing animal in the wild. The experts committee had recommended that the elephant must be fed well with Ragi, Ragi grass, fresh grass, sugarcane, banana, paddy husk and rice balls along with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic medicines on everyday basis till it was shifted to suitable environment for better medical intervention.
