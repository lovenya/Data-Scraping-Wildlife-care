Copenhagen: A bid to save a young giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo failed, as it was put down on Sunday. Thousands had signed online petitions appealing for a change of heart over the two-year-old called Marius. 	
 	The zoo said it had no choice because of its duty to avoid in-breeding and preserve the best genes. Marius was killed by a bolt gun. The carcass will partly be used for research and partly to feed carnivores at the zoo. 	
 	The Yorkshire Wildlife Park, which has a state-of-the-art giraffe house and capacity for an extra male, was among several zoos which put in a last-ditch offers to take Marius. Animal rights campaigners have described the move as barbaric and have accused the zoo of being unethical.
