Just when you think humanity is waning from society’s moral grounds, instances like this restore your faith in humankind. In this one-of-a-kind incident, residents of a drought-hit village made a parched king cobra drink water straight from a water bottle.

A video has made its way to the social media and soon became viral. The venomous snake reached Karnataka’s Kaiga village. In the video, an animal rescuer can be seen offering water to the deadly snake, which seems to be peacefully drinking the water without posing any threat to villagers.

However, considering the danger, one man held cobra’s tail to prevent him from launching an attack, while another held the water bottle. He also poured some water on his head in order to cool it down in the scorching heat. 
 
Reportedly, the crawling beast was taken to an animal shelter later, where is being inspected and treated.

The 12-foot-long snake apparently strayed into the village in search for water. Wildlife officials said that the drought conditions have hit life in several parts of southern India and has left wild animals in the region dehydrated.

The video has garnered praise from people on social media, who hailed the villagers’ courage and humanity for the kind gesture.
