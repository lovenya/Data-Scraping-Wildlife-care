The kite and the common crow may not exactly be buddies in the sky, but on Saturday, the two birds were entangled by a similar fate as they dangled from a 70-foot tree at Vyalikaval. Commuters on the road connecting Bhashyam Circle and Palace Guttahalli Circle suffered along with them for over two hours as the rescue drama unfolded. High drama
 The pariah kite and crow were caught on a manja, or string that kite-flyers use, near Vyalikaval police station. They were said to have been stuck since Friday, but residents noticed them only on Saturday morning.
 
 Residents called up the BBMP after which its wildlife volunteers swung into action, but it did not yield the desired results.
 
 “Our volunteers had to struggle for more than two hours,” said Sharath R Babu, wildlife advisor, BBMP.  The volunteers didn’t have it easy since the tree was a tall one and the birds were dangling from a height of over 70 feet. “Also, the volunteers had to work from the road and traffic came to a standstill, making rescue even more difficult,” Babu said. Initially, the volunteers tried to rescue the birds by using a ball to cut the string. With the exercise continuing for about two hours, commuters taking the road towards Guttahalli Circle had no choice but to stop and watch.
 
 “We couldn’t cut the manja to which the birds were stuck,” said Rajesh, a wildlife volunteer.
 
 They then sought the help of Bescom staff who brought a 40-foot mobile ladder. Volunteers climbed it and cut the string with the help of a long stick.
 
 Two-and-a-half hours later, the crow and kite were rescued and traffic cleared. Ban on manja sought
 Wildlife cell volunteers are planning to write to the authorities to ban the use of manja. “Banning manja in the city will help check such incidents,” said Sharath Babu. “The majority of such incidents occur because of manja. Besides putting birds in danger, they also cause such nuisance with traffic jams etc.”
