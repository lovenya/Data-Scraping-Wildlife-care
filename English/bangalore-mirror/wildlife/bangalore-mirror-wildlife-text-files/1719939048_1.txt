A rare sighting of an Indian Nightjar bird was reported from an apartment on Sarjapur Road. Wildlife rescuers jumped to action; however, the bird’s beak was found bent.
 
The nocturnal Indian Nightjar is more prominent in the northern part of India and is not a common sight in the city’s limits. However, it can be spotted in wooded areas of Bengaluru. The bird is known for its characteristic clicking sound that becomes shorter and faster.
 
A Bengaluru-based techie was able to spot the bird and call the authorities concerned for rescue. The nocturnal bird had flown inside the apartment building in the evening hours.
 
“I noticed a bird was sitting outside my apartment door. Perhaps, it was trying to fly outside, but kept hitting the roof. The bird was stressed and we covered it with a sheet and called rescuers from the People For Animals (PFA) hospital,” said Daisy, a resident of Springfield Apartments on Sarjapur Road.
 
In the meanwhile, the resident gave some ORS and mashed eggs to feed the bird. However, she added that rescuers advised against feeding the wild bird.

“We were able to rescue it at 11:30 pm. The bird was neatly placed in a cardboard box. After bringing the bird to our hospital, we noticed both beaks have been bent.
 
Maybe, it bumped into a hard surface while chasing an insect, causing the bent. Currently, the bird has been placed in ICU and is being fed on mealworms and glucose,” said Col Dr Nawaz Shariff, General Manager and Chief Veterinarian at PFA hospital.
 
As it was a small bird, it was not given any injectables but medicines administered orally, he added.
 
He added that in three - four days, an X-ray would be taken and a further course of action for the beak’s correction would be identified. The doctor estimated that the bird would be in their care for at least a month until reaching full rehabilitation.
