The jeep carrying the two techies and their families broke down 15 km inside the reserve. Luckily for them, the driver managed to repair the vehicle and got them out after a tense 45-minute wait
 
 A safari trip in a protected tiger reserve can be an awe-inspiring thing. But what if something goes wrong and one is marooned in the middle of dense forest crawling with wild, ferocious animals and cut off from all civilization?
 
 Two techies and their families were left stranded deep in the Bhadra Tiger Reserve Wildlife Sanctuary a fortnight ago after their safari jeep broke down. They had no way of calling up help since their phones didn’t work, nor did the driver of the jeep have any means of communicating with his employers. No one knew their precise location, so a search party would have been clueless. And trekking back — a distance of 15km — was not an option since women and children were in tow.
 
 Luckily for Prashanth Arkalgud, his family and the family of his friend, the driver of the jeep was a bit of a mechanic. Arkalgud, who works for a US-based software firm in city, writes about his harrowing experience.
 
 We checked into River Tern Lodge (Bhadra Tiger Reserve Wildlife Sanctuary) on October 14. We had signed up for the jeep safari the next day at 6.30 am and we were all excited and looking forward to it.
 
 We were a total of eight, including the driver and three children and we climbed into the open, soft-roofed jeep and set off. We spotted peacocks, deer and wild boar during the ride. About 40 minutes into the two-hour safari and about 15 km inside the jungle, the driver stopped when he spotted a herd of gaurs crossing our path.
 
 The gaurs were barely 30 metres in front of us and the driver turned off the engine so as to not disturb the animals. Wild animals rarely attack humans without provocation, but one can never say what a wild animal would do. After the gaurs had crossed the path, the driver attempted to re-start the jeep. But alas, it would not start. It would not start even after multiple attempts. The driver and the men got off and began to push the jeep, hoping to do a push start. We had no luck with that either.
 
 We asked the driver if he had a radio, satellite phone or walkie-talkie with which he could call for help, but he had none. We learnt from the driver that a court ruling had banned these gadgets about a year ago. Our mobile phones were useless since there was no signal. We were marooned in the middle of jungle, cut off from all civilization!
 
 The driver then opened the bonnet of the jeep and noticed that the "starter bolt" had come loose and fallen off. He walked around looking for it for a little while, but when he couldn’t find it, he decided to try and fix the jeep. He took out a few tools, crawled underneath the vehicle and began work.
 
 Inside the jeep, our adult minds were working desperately on a solution. We found no viable ones. Realising the gravity of the situation, the children, for the most part, were hushed into scared silence. But we had no answers to their stray questions such as ‘what should we do if a tiger approaches us?’
 
 After about 45 minutes, our driver was able to repair the jeep with another bolt. Fortunately for us the jeep revved to life when he cranked the engine. But the experience had drained all the excitement and thrill of a safari in the wild. We were so afraid, that we asked the driver not to stop the vehicle, and drive back to River Tern Lodge. The driver was the hero for getting us to safety.
 
 Back at the lodge we spoke to the manager of the unit, Salma Nahid, and found to our dismay that there was no plan in place for such emergencies. We got contradicting explanations — another jeep would be sent to look for the missing vehicle, or the two safari jeeps circle back after a point and return together. We also learnt that tourists in another jeep that was ahead of us by five minutes had spotted a tigress with three cubs. I shudder to think what those tourists would have done if their jeep had broken down at that juncture.
 
 We found that the lodge does not maintain a log book detailing the route of the jeeps, details of driver, details of the passengers etc. The officials claimed that if a safari jeep does not return after the usual time, another team is sent out to look for the tourists. But when we asked them how they would know where to look given the absence of a log book, they had no answer. When I insisted on speaking to the managing director, he sent a text message saying he was busy and to call him later. There was a naturalist at the camp, but he didn’t accompany us on the safari.
 
 Although we were refunded the safari fees, but what we really wanted was for the officials to acknowledge the lapses in security of tourists and rectify their mistakes before taking tourists inside on such safaris. After returning to Bangalore, I sent out mails to the manager, advisor and managing director Anur Reddy. Forget taking action, none of them even bothered to acknowledge my mail. The government should wake up to this negligence and implement measures to ensure the safety of travellers. If they cannot, it is best they ban safaris.
 
 
 Lapses in security
 
 * Jeep had a canvas top and was open at the sides
 
 * Apart from the driver, no other employee was sent
 
 * Jeep was not equipped with a mechanism to contact authorities in times of emergency
 
 * Driver wasn’t equipped with weapons to be used in times of emergency
 
 * The "manager" of River Tern Lodge had no clear plan of action on what to do in such situations
 
 Suggestions for Change
 
 * Use latest technology (GPS tracking of jeeps, weapons for personnel) to ensure safety of passengers
 
 * Have one-way communication between safari jeep and a control room
 
 * Provide satellite phones to jeep drivers or guests. These phones can be setup to only call the control tower (to limit inter-jeep/inter-people communication)
 
 * Use closed jeeps with transparent windows and grills
 
 * Always keep a back-up/empty vehicle for every jeep that enters the jungle, to ferry the guests and driver at times of breakdown
 
 * If none of the above can be implemented ban safaris until safety of tourists can be ensured
