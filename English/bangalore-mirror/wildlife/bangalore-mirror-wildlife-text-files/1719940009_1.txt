Motorists warned of slow-moving traffic due to elephant movement

Motorists received an advisory from the police on Saturday informing them of potential slow-moving traffic near NICE Road-Bannerghatta Road due to elephant movement.
 
According to a traffic official, they received information that elephants were spotted near NICE Road during the early hours and alerted the police.
 
Subsequently, the police, accompanied by forest department officials, inspected the area and notified the public about expected traffic delays. After an hour or two of examination, vehicular movement was permitted. Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) MN Anucheth mentioned the use of advanced AI predictive analysis to identify traffic congestion in Bengaluru.
 
The maps revealed congestion during night hours, leading to the identification of elephant movement in the area as well. The police took preventive measures and restored traffic after addressing the situation.

Wildlife sightings around NICE Road, Kanakapura, and Bannerghatta Roads are commonplace, with cautionary signs indicating a leopard-frequented area along NICE Road.
 
In 2022, a wild elephant died on Kanakapura Road after being hit by a BMTC bus, underscoring the need to secure the elephant corridor around Bengaluru. Despite the completion of a survey on elephant corridors by the Bengaluru district administration, challenges remain in clearing the corridor for safe animal movement.

A senior official highlighted encroachments along the elephant corridor, posing a challenge to eviction efforts. Plans include creating an eco-sensitive zone, restricting certain activities, controlling noise pollution, and considering restrictions on night vehicle movements. Environmentalists urged the government to complete the survey of the 1000-acre elephant corridor and allocate 232 acres to the forest department.

Bannerghatta, being one of the forest zones nearest to the city, requires protection, and the corridor is crucial for wildlife.
 
Environmentalists stressed the importance of executing the corridor project promptly without harming the environment.
 
Activists also noted the need to establish the Ragihalli elephant corridor, ensuring the development of surrounding areas to support elephants and prevent human-animal conflict in the park.
