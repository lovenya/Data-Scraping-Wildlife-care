The only reason electrical contractor Kiran Kumar stopped by a shuddering box that seemed to have slid out of a horror movie on Tuesday was because he thought it was an abandoned baby wriggling inside. But his blood curdled when he saw a 6-foot Indian rock python weighing 10 kg.
 
 The parcel box, found near BMS Institute of Technology, Yelahanka, is believed to belong to the nearby residential area dotted with posh villas and apartments.
 
 “I saw a wooden parcel box on the road and it was shaking,” said Kumar, who first noticed it. I initially thought there was a baby inside and went closer. However, I was shocked to see a huge python. I called the police and the wildlife cell volunteers.”
 
 Rajesh, a volunteer who rescued the reptile, said: “The python’s nostril shield was damaged. It is being treated and will be released shortly. It looks like the python was caught and packed inside. Later, it was deliberately left on the road.”
 
 “We have started investigating the antecedents of the parcel box,” said Sharath Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore.
 
 Since the python is a protected animal under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act, wildlife sleuths believe that zeroing in on the household will offer leads to illegal pet trade involving endangered species. The owner can face arrest under the Act.
 Though this is the first case of a python being found, illegal pet trade involving endangered animals is rampant in the city.
