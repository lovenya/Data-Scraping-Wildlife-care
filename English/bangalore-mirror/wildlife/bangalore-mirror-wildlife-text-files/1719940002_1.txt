According to the Avian and Reptile Rehabilitation Center (ARRC) that initiated the SayNoToManjha campaign recently, over the past six years (2018-2023), a total of 10,226 manjha-related rescues have taken place.

Thirumalesh Sheshadri, Rescue Manager, ARRC, said, “Manjha, coated with crushed glass and metal, poses severe threats as it cannot only cut opponent kites but also cause harm to humans. Thousands of birds and numerous individuals fall victim to this lethal string each year, creating a pervasive issue in our city.”

Various awareness programmes were carried out across the city.
 
Neelalochana Pujar, outreach coordinator, ARRC, said, “At ARRC we carried out a citywide SayNoToManjha campaign, where 500 auto-rickshaws in manjha hotspots carried posters displaying awareness messages. Encouragingly, increased awareness and proactive reporting of manjha cases have been observed. Awareness sessions were conducted in government schools and collaborating with shopkeepers to display awareness posters.
 
Apart from this, citizen testimonials documented, urging for stricter ban implementation and cleanup activities and awareness sessions to advocate for manjha-free skies was carried out at Lalbagh botanical garden on Sunday.”

From the People For Animal (PfA) wildlife rescue hospital, over 1,934 birds were rescued and treated due to manjha injuries between 2019-2023.
 
About the various injuries caused by manjha to the birds, Colonel (Dr) Nawaz Shariff, chief veterinarian, of PfA Wildlife Hospital said, “Tragically, entangled birds often bear the brunt of severe injuries, manifesting as flight feather damage, bone fractures, head injuries from falls, and trauma to the neck and legs. Regrettably, a considerable number succumb to these injuries before we can intervene, while those who do survive face an arduous journey towards recovery. Sadly, a significant portion of these survivors, owing to the gravity of their injuries, are unable to regain flight, underscoring the challenging path many of these resilient beings must traverse.”

On what steps the state government could take to ensure there is a complete ban on these threads, Dr Shariff said the ban on manjhas was a commendable step. “However, the efficacy of this ban hinges on robust enforcement. The government must now intensify its efforts by implementing stringent penalties, enhancing surveillance, and collaborating with law enforcement agencies to ensure that those who flout the ban face strict consequences.”
