After deer and elephants, King Cobras — the world’s largest venomous snakes — are now at risk of being mowed down by speeding vehicles in various forests of Karnataka. Though the government has banned night traffic in Bandipur in order to prevent road kills, zipping vehicles, in the absence of signboards and speed breakers, continue to kill several endangered animals. The latest to come under the wheel is the endangered King Cobra.
 
 A 15-foot-long King Cobra was mowed by an unidentified vehicle on the Aurad-Sadashivgad state highway (SH-34) passing through Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserve on Tuesday. The incident came to light only on Friday. Protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act, the snake was killed on the spot by the speeding vehicle.
 
 Wildlife conservationists have attributed the death of the snake to the absence of signboards and lack of measures to check speeding vehicles on SH-34. “The number of King Cobras has been on the steady decline due to loss of habitat, and even the small level conservation along the Western Ghats is threatened by speeding vehicles,” explained Narasimha Chapkhanda, honorary wildlife warden of Sirsi circle.
 
 Giridhar Kulkarni, a techie and a conservationist at Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserve, said, “This is the fourth time that a King Cobra is being killed by a moving vehicle. In the last few years, several King Cobras have been run over by vehicles that zip through forests. In March 2015, a King Cobra was killed near Puttur in Dakshina Kannada. Prior to that, in 2014, a similar incident was reported near Agumbe in Shivamogga and Syntheri Rocks near Dandeli.”
 
 Dandeli-Anshi, which has a satisfactory population of tigers, has 14 major public access roads cutting through it. In fact, SH 34 has turned out to be a death trap for wild animals as the same highway has witnessed the deaths of chital, wild boar, civet, leopard cat, small Indian civet, langur and bonnet macaques due to speeding vehicles.
