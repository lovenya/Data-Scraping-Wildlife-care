Elephant named Siddha, which was rescued recently while it was trying to cross the Bidadi Main Road, was again found in distress during treatment, and was saved again by two deliverers
 
 
 The adult elephant named Siddha which was injured after it fell into a depression while attempting to cross Bidadi main road and was stuck in Manchanbelle dam, was rescued from the forest department on Friday with the help of two other male elephants named Harsha from Dubare wildlife and Gajendra from Chamrajnagar wildlife.
 
 The elephant, which suffered a broken leg and was blinded in one eye, was often seen in villages such as Ramohalli and Chikkanahalli in the Manchanbelle dam area.
 
 Villagers later alerted the forest department. They, however, claimed that it was dragged to Manchanbelle dam backwater to be treated by forest officials. The rescue operation was started on Friday morning and ended up by bringing the elephant out from the water. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Dr. Nagaraj, veterinary doctor from Bandipur National Park, says “rescuing or treating the wild animal is not that easy as we think because its behaviour will be aggressive. So we took the help of other elephants which are well trained.”
 
 
 Nagaraj was told by the department to join hands with a Delhi team in the rescue operation. “We started our rescue operation from 10.30 in the morning. We had a team from Delhi join us.
 
 
 The elephant was near Haverhill (Manchanbelle dam back water) and we injected some antibiotic and have taken some some x-rays of its injured parts. The condition of the elephant is very bad but we have to wait till the x-ray report and then act. The report has been sent to Bannerghatta lab”
