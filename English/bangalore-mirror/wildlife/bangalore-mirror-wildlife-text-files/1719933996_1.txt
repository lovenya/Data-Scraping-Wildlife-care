Apparently, Ajay Devgn had tried buddy Dutt’s private phone a day before the birthday on thursday to ask about Dutt’s plans. With his phone switched off Devgn called up Dutt’s business manager Dharam Oberoi, who told Devgn he will convey his birthday greetings to his boss, who had given strict instructions to his staff: no calls, no messages.Suniel Shetty, Ajay Devgn and Abhishek Bachchan were some of Dutt’s buddies who couldn’t reach the birthday boy.

                          A close friend and a co-star who wanted to reach Dutt on his birthday was discernibly annoyed. “Yeh thoda zyada ho gaya. I couldn’t get him on the phone or his wife’s phone. What about all his fans? Didn’t they have the right to wish their Sanju baba?”

Dutt’s business manager was tightlipped about the star’s location. “All the birthday greetings would be eventually conveyed. But on his birthday Mr Dutt had given strict instructions that he was not to be disturbed. He did give me a private number for emergencies. But I wasn’t allowed to call him on that. I have collected everyone’s greetings and will convey them to Mr Dutt when he surfaces.”

So the question is where was Dutt on his birthday? According to sources he was hidden away in a wildlife sanctuary in South Africa which was absolutely shut off from civilization. Apparently Dutt wanted only his three non-filmy buddies and his wife on the occasion.

Apparently even his sisters couldn’t get in touch with him. A reclusive life indeed, shut up from civilization and into the wild, huh?
