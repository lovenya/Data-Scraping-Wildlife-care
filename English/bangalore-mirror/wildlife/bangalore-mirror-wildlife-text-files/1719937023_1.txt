If all goes as per plan, within the next one month, the Tyavarekoppa lion safari will have two more lions in addition to the existing two. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) MC Cheluvaraj said currently there are only two lions in the safari and the male is old.
 
 “We are getting a pair of adult lions from the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP). The matter is being taken up with the authorities. It has been approved by the Karnataka Zoo Authority and it is in the process of getting approval from the Central Zoo Authority in New Delhi,” Cheluvaraj said.
 
 While this is expected to happen in the next 30 days, the department is also considering getting two more Asiatic lions from Gir. However, this may take time as the process is in its initial stage. A team may have to visit Gir and request for translocation of two Asiatic lions.
 
 “Once we get approval from Gir, the department will have to write to the State Chief Wildlife Warden. The process is lengthy and laborious as the lions are being brought from the wild,” he said.
 
 In the past, he said, there were about six lions in Tyavarekoppa. A few years ago, due to age and certain abnormalities, we lost four.
 
 According to sources, there are currently only two lions, 14-year-old Arya and 5-year-old Manya, and interestingly they are father and daughter.
