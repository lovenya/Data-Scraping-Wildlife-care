The photo-identification exercise is a component of the Whale Shark Conservation Project — a joint venture of the Gujarat Forest Department, the Tata Chemicals Limited and the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). Aimed at studying the population and migration of whale sharks, the photo identification is being implemented in collaboration with ECOCEAN, which maintains the global whale shark database and coordinates this international research.

As this whale shark was the first to be identified in India, it has been labelled I-001 (which is now the permanent identification for this individual). The whale shark photo-identification is being done in a lot of other countries, but this individual has not been recorded elsewhere.

“As the research progresses, we will be trying to figure out if this individual, as well as others that we encounter in the future, belong to a resident population or are migratory,” said Dhiresh Joshi, coordinator, WTI. 

The identification process employed underwater photography and subsequent comparison of the photographs in a global database of whale sharks reported and identified from more than 40 countries across the world. Pattern of spots around the pectoral fins and gills region is used to identify individual whale sharks.

The underwater photographs were taken during a whale shark rescue operation carried out by a team of Gujarati fishermen, Forest officials and biologists from WTI, on April 12. 

The identified whale shark had been accidentally caught in a fishing net off the Veraval coast.
