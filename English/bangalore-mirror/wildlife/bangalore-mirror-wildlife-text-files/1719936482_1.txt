Two leopards, including an endangered black leopard, were allegedly poisoned to death near Bandipur tiger reserve on Tuesday morning. Following a tip-off from villagers, the forest department officials rushed to the Omkara hill ranges to find two leopards battling for survival. The desperate attempts to shift the leopards did not pay off as they died en route to hospital. The carcasses were then taken to the Bandipur forest range office where a post mortem was to be conducted. Rana, the sniffer dog, was pressed into service, and it is suspected that the leopards might have died due to pesticide consumption.
 
 In fact, poisoning of leopards is not an uncommon phenomenon in these parts. Last year, a leopard was poisoned to death in Nagarahole, while another died in a similar fashion in Bandipur in 2014. Sources in the forest department said that villagers sometimes put out poisoned carcasses when they suspected the wild creatures may have strayed into the vicinity.
 	
 	  	Forest officials said they would take up measures like educating villagers against poisoning wild animals. It is also said that the Omkara hills region, near Bandipur, has been a zone of conflict between villagers and forest department officials over the entry of wild animals like elephants and leopards. 	
 	
 	A wildlife expert working in Bandipur region said, “The poisoning of the leopards is a warning for the forest department. In fact, we have seen a rise in these incidents. Some villagers are resorting to extreme measures and expressing their anguish against the forest department for not providing timely compensation (over animal attacks).”
