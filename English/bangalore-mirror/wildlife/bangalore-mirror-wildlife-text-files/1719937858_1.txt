The Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur on Monday issued notice to Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam Kothari, Tabu and Dushyant Singh based on an appeal by the Rajasthan government challenging their acquittal by a local court in the Blackbuck Poaching case in 2018.


Last year, a Jodhpur court had sentenced Salman Khan to five years in jail for killing two blackbucks during the shooting of Hum Saath Saath Hain in October 1998 but acquitted his co-accused Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre by giving them the benefit of the doubt.


Salman was convicted in the case and was granted bail in April 2018. The actor had challenged his five-year jail sentence for killing endangered blackbucks. In October 1998, three cases in connection with poaching and one under the Arms Act were registered against Salman. The 52-year-old actor allegedly shot two blackbucks in Bhagoda ki Dhani in Kankani village near Jodhpur during the shoot.


Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Tabu and Neelam were also allegedly present in the vehicle with Salman. Blackbucks are an endangered species protected under Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Act.
