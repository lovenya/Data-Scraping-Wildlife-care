Over 200 birds belonging to about 10-12 species were reportedly caught in Chinese Manja strings across the city in 2014 alone. Even after an order was passed imposing a ban on the sale of Chinese Manja in Karnataka, the government is yet to enforce it, complain BBMP wildlife cell volunteers.
 
 	Even though kites were mostly flown during summer and less at other periods of the year, birds suffered the effect of severed Manja strings right through the year. BBMP wildlife cell volunteers feel one of the factors contributing to this could be due to the fact that the Chinese Manja strings are more durable than traditionally used cotton strings and were not easily biodegradable, thus posing a greater danger to birds in the city.
 	  	The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) wrote to the additional chief secretary, Forest, Ecology and Environment, on May 2014, to ban the Chinese kite ‘Nylon’ thread in the State of Karnataka with the help of respective departments. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, wildlife advisor Sharath Babu R said, “But still the ban is not enforced in our state, due to which many birds are suffering. In most rescues, we find birds entangled in Chinese Manja strings.” 
 	  	In a study, they found that a great majority of the birds entangled in Manja strings were rescued from the core of the city and not on the outskirts. It is observed that distribution of birds affected by Manja strings was due to the fact that the areas happen to be part of old, densely-packed residential localities of Bengaluru city where kite flying is traditionally practiced from roof-tops, rather than in the city outskirts. Between November 2010 and April 2013, 155 instances with a total of 188 birds were reportedly caught in Manja strings in city.
