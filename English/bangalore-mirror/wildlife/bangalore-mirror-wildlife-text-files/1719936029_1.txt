Shivashankar M, 41, a software engineer from Karkala, who was earlier instrumental in uniting birdwatchers of the coastal belt, is all set to launch an Android application, Hakki Prapancha, along with a friend, Habeeb. The highlight of this app is that it is a bilingual (Kannada and English) application. This is probably the first application on birds in Kannada.
 
 	Shivashankar said that it is an interactive app on birds of Karnataka that bird lovers can use in Kannada and English. It is an extension of the book Birds of Southern Coastal Karnataka co-authored by Prabhakar Achar and Shivashankar M.
 	  	Of the usage of the app, he said, “The application displays information such as common and scientific names, key features and habitat of birds along with high-resolution images. A user can shift to English text by pressing and holding on the description. Currently, the app has records of 31 birds found in Karnataka. Another 20 will be added in a week’s time. Based on the feedback, we plan to introduce more features such as last 10 sightings of a bird, playing the call of a bird and so on. Instead of going through an e-book, which could be monotonous, we thought an interactive app could attract more nature lovers. In future, we also plan to launch an exclusive app with in-depth data exclusively for professionals.”
 	  	The app will be formally launched during the wildlife week celebrations at Bhuvanendra College in Karkala. Born in Udupi, Shivashankar completed his education in the Malnad region. He obtained a BE degree from Mysore University and an MS from Manipal University. He has specialised in embedded software development, telecommunication software and system software.
