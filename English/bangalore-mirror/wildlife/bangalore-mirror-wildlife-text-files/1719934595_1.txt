We often hear about heroic efforts to save stranded cats or injured animals around the world. If you thought such rescues happen only in other countries, then think again. On Monday evening, the fire department fought for close to four hours to save a monkey hit by a speeding car, despite heavy traffic and pouring rain. The incident also saw the mother trying to protect its child despite being severely injured.   It was at around 8 pm that the BBMP wildlife rescue team got a call, informing it about an injured monkey near Sarjapur Road. The animal was badly injured and to make matters worse, its baby was refusing to leave the mother.    “When we reached there, we found the accident had cracked open the monkey’s skull and it was bleeding profusely. But it was getting difficult to get near her because she was aggressively protecting her baby,” said .   The situation got worse when the monkey, fearing the crowd, climbed a tree nearby with her baby. “Trying to catch a monkey on a tree, even if it is injured, is very difficult. So we asked the fire department for help,’’ said Mahesh.    A fire engine was sent to the spot immediately and with the help of a long ladder, the firemen and the wardens began their rescue effort.   What followed was a chase across the trees lining the stretch. With the skies opening up, visibility became a problem. “Every time we tried to get close to her, she jumped on to another branch. The problem was that she was protecting her child despite her injuries and every time we got close, she was getting away. The eight of us – four fire personnel and four volunteers – tried our best to bring her down, but in vain,’’ said Mahesh.   Finally, after almost four hours of chasing, they managed to corner the mother on a tree. After cutting off the rest of the stretch, they managed to set a trap for the mother and her baby. Their efforts paid off. The animal is now recuperating at Kengeri animal shelter.
