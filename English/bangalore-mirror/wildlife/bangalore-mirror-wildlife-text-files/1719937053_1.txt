Selfies have claimed yet another life as a city youth was trampled by elephants while trying to take a selfie.
 
 Desperate for a selfie with an elephant, 30-year-old Abhilash broke into the Bannerghatta Biological Part (BBP) safari area on Tuesday only to be trampled by elephants inside the park. Abhilash, a resident of Girinagar, died near the Seegekatte point inside BBP. The tragic death raises questions about the security around the wildlife park. Sources in the BBP told BM that the park was closed on Tuesday on account of weekly holiday.
 
 Driven by the craze of clicking selfies with animals, Abhilash had gained entry into the park on Tuesday evening. “He parked his bike near the Hakki-Pikki Colony located behind the BBP safari area and sneaked into the park illegally along with a couple of his friends. As he was reportedly clicking selfies in front the elephant named Sundar, it had attacked him and trampled him to death,” a senior official at BBP revealed.
 
 Initial investigations have revealed that the deceased had previously managed to go till the crawls of elephants – Rowdi Ranga and Airavatha – and click selfies.
 Abhilash was busy clicking photographs and completely unaware of the elephant’s imminent attack. Before he knew it, he was caught in the elephant’s trunk and was unable to run away.
 
 On hearing about the tragic incident, BBP officials, with the help of Bannerghatta police, shifted Abhilash’s body to Victoria Hospital and, subsequently, his parents identified him and the bike parked near Hakki-Pikki Colony.
 
 Enraged over the lapses in security arrangements around the park, the parents have lodged a complaint with the Bannerghatta police.
 
 In the meantime, BBP officials have clarified that Abhilash had entered the park illegally and that too when the park was closed.
