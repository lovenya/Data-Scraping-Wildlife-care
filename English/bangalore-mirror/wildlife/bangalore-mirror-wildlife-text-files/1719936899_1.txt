 Commerce & Arts Stream
 Similar to Science, the Commerce stream too offers a wide arena of choices. This is why many science students choose to do master
 
 in commerce even after having valid masters in science stream. When it comes to Arts stream, I believe it has been most overlooked field of study, as aspiring students always considered arts stream as a least preferred option. The real fact is that Art is as competitive and as challenging as any other stream. Presently, students who passionately prefer arts as their field of study have multiple career choices available to them. never mind what herd says, consider the following field and courses.
