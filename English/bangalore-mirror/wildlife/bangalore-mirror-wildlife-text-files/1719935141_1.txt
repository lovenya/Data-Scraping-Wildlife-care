As per NTCA directive, tiger reserves in state will be cleared of all human habitation over the next five years
 
 Alongside the quadrennial tiger census spanning eight days that took off on a grand note on Monday, the four major tiger reserves (excluding Bandipur Tiger Reserve) are bracing up for a massive rehabilitation programme: A whopping 1,576 families will move out of the tiger zones. 

 	The move is billed as the largest such programme after the one in Bagalkot for the Upper Krishna Project at Alamatti. Local people supported by their representatives have refused to move out of the forest in the past. Now, the government has directed the forest department to rehabilitate all the families and has earmarked Rs 35 crore for the purpose. The whole exercise will cost over Rs 161 crore (see box). 

 The ‘Rehabilitation of families living inside Tiger Reserves, National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries’ will take wing from the current financial year. The programme has been set a deadline of five years. Families that voluntarily move out of Nagarahole, Bhadra, Dandeli-Anshi and Kudremukh reserves will be paid compensation as per the guidelines laid down by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). “For those willing to rehabilitate voluntarily from these protected areas, the government has consented to give a compensation package as directed by the NTCA at a cost of Rs 35 crore,” the order said. 

 	As per the detailed assessment made by the forest department, more than 6,000 people need to be rehabilitated under the programme. All villagers inside Bandipur Tiger Reserve have already been rehabilitated, but the government could not continue the same in the remaining four reserves following intense protest all these years. But the government has no option now but to follow the directives from the Union government. In Nagarahole National Park area alone, falling in the backyard of chief minister Siddaramaiah’s home district of Mysore, 818 families have to move.
