Missing: House sparrow. Accused of: Abandoning our city without notice. This isn’t a lookout notice for some missing sparrow in the city. It’s a campaign launched to bring back sparrows — a rare species of late, thanks to urbanisation — in the city.   As part of the campaign launched on Tuesday, the BBMP wildlife volunteers, with support from the bird lovers, will place nests in different parts of the city.    A ‘Missing Sparrow’ poster will be pasted next to each nest. “All important places in the city will have such posters. We hope to draw public attention and help bring back sparrows in the city,” Sharath R Babu, environment advisor to BBMP, told Bangalore Mirror. The BBMP is giving away nests free of cost to bird lovers.   The posters will be placed in malls, important junctions, market places and areas frequented by people.    Rohini Ghatpande, another volunteer, said boxes made of soil (earlier cardboard boxes were used) would be used as sparrow nests.    The volunteers have devised short- and long-term strategies for bringing back sparrows. While giving away sparrow nests is a short-term goal, the bigger goal is that of planting saplings that attract these birds. “We will appeal to every resident to participate in the drive,” Rohini added.   Those who want to be part of the drive can call BBMP’s wildlife helpline 98801 08801.
