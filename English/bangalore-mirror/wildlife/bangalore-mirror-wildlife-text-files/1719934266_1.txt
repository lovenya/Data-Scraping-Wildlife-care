The deer skin seized from the house of Mahendra          A mobile squad of the forest department on Wednesday arrested the son of a retired army officer who practised black magic by sacrificing wild animals. The sleuths recovered two fresh spotted deer skins and a third one which appeared old from his possession. All three had bullet marks on them.
 
 The sleuths, who raided Mahendra’s house in Dasarahalli on a tip-off from local residents who grew suspicious about his activities, also found blood stains — which they believe to be of several wild animals — and a number of weird-looking items apparently used for black magic in his room. 
 
 The forest officials suspect that Mahendra, who confessed that he had procured the deer skins from a place near Annamalai forests in Tamil Nadu, has been involved in wildlife trade for years to facilitate his black magic.
 
 “We are interrogating him for leads to other people who are involved in the trade. So far, he has only admitted that he used the items for religious purpose,” said Manjunath, deputy conservator of forests, Bangalore. 
 
 Mahendra, who is a native of Bangalore, belongs to a wealthy family. His brothers are well-settled and his father is a retired army officer.  “He offered solutions to all problems that people face through more than 25 types of black magic,” sources said. 
 
 Forest sleuths, who have booked him for violating the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, have started a probe to crack the network through which he procured the wild animals as well as other items. They are also looking for his clients.
