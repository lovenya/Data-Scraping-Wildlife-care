Barely a month after home minister R Ashoka made headlines for misusing his power to influence the zoo authorities at Bannerghatta to provide an elephant to add colour to a function at his son’s college, forest minister C P Yogeshwar has done the same — this time for a temple festival. Home minister made jumbo arrangement for son&rsquo;s college 
 Wildlife Activists and Elephant Task Force, an organisation set up by the Centre to check abuse of captive elephants, has protested against an order issued by Uma Devi, an under secretary in the forest department, asking the zoo authorities to provide an elephant to the Ayyappa Temple in Jalahalli for two days (Friday and Saturday) to be used for the processions.  
 According to norms, elephants from the zoo can be used only during state functions like the Dasara. Even on such occasions, there are set conditions like obtaining a fitness certificate of the animal, permission for transporting the animal, approval from the local deputy conservator of forest, the consent of the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and Karnataka Zoo Authority.  
 “They can’t give permission like that. This is in blatant violation of set guidelines and Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” said Sharath R Babu, honorary wildlife warden (Bangalore Urban). 
 Uma Devi said she issued the order on the directions of the minister. “We pass an order only after our higher-ups authorise us to do it. In this case, the recommendations of the MLAs was considered after the minister’s direction to consider it as a special case. I don’t think there is any violation of rules in it,” she said.
