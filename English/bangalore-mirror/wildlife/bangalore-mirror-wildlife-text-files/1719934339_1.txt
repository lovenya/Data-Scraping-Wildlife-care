An early-morning raid by the forest department and BBMP at Majestic on Sunday threw up proof of a bizarre trade: Frozen wildlife in merchandise like keychains, paper weights, pendants and earrings. And you can take your pick — from dung beetles to ants to scorpions to butterflies and even reptiles. The sleuths took three shopkeepers into custody and seized 36 creatures frozen in glass. The fact that all these are protected under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 makes it a serious offence, say officials of the forest mobile squad and BBMP forest cell, who were tipped off about the business near Triveni theatre.
   The raids were as shocking to the sleuths as it was for shopkeepers in the area, clueless about the booming illegal trade around them.
   “We were shocked to see wildlife in that state as they had not been killed but frozen to death,” R Sharath Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, told Bangalore Mirror. “It’s a dangerous and illegal trade that is unfortunately encouraged by college students.”
   The trade is said to run into crores. Wildlife from India is transported to China, frozen to death to make merchandise, brought back and sold from Rs 25 onwards, depending on the animal used, say sleuths.
   “We are shocked as there were similar cases in 2005. However, immediate action put a stop to it. Now that it’s back again, it will be dealt with seriously,” Sharath Babu said.
