Kolkata: Assam’s Cachar Forest Division of Silchar nabbed an illegal consignment of exotic wildlife late on Tuesday night and rescued a kangaroo, six Macaw parrots, three tortoises and two monkeys. Two persons were arrested in the case.

The vehicle carrying the endangered animals was seized at Lailapur Forest Sub-Beat by the forest officals and the animals were rescued. The truck was coming from Mizoram. Two persons, Narsimha Reddy and Navnath Tukaram Daigude, were arrested. During interrogation, they confessed that the consignment was heading to Guwahati.

The forest authorities intercepted the vehicle (truck bearing registration No. TS 08 UB 1622) at around 11:30 pm and rescued the animals.

Meanwhile, Forest Range Officer of Hawaithang Range (Dholai) D Deori has launched an investigation led by DFO Cachar Forest Division Sunnydeo Choudhary.

"In backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and its connection to wet markets, we must put an end to such practices of petting these exotic species and refrain from illegal wildlife trade. The animals must be allowed to live in their natural habitat," said Deori, adding that identification of the exact species is going on.
