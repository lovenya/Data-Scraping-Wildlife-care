A file photo of Amit Jethava and his wife                 Jethava was aware of the fact that he was playing with fire, therefore, the wildlife activist had filed an affidavit on a threat to his life. “I know how risky it is for me and my family to wage a war against the mining mafia,” he had said, adding, “It pains me to see that the people are failing to acknowledge my efforts.”

Known for calling a spade a spade, Jethava had more enemies than friends. During a public meeting in Khambha village, a few months ago, Jethava was publicly threatened. And it was for this reason that he had to leave his native place and come to Ahmedabad.

Also, Jethava lost his membership on the State Wildlife Advisory Board headed by the chief minister for his frankness in 2002. The former chief wildlife warden G A Patel spiked his chances of being appointed on the board on the pretext that he may even not be afraid of speaking up against the chief minister. 

In another incident, Jethava had filed a PIL challenging the appointment of J K Vyas to the post of environment director on the grounds that he was not eligible for the post. The case was settled in Jethava’s favour.
