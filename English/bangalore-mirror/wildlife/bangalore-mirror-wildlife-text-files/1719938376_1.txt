Raising them green

FILMMAKER Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who is working on the NR Narayana-Sudha Murthy film and her first novel, has us charmed. Recently she revisited her Kangana Ranaut-led ‘Panga’ during a virtual chat with Dia Mirza. Besides sharing that her art director painstakingly grew a garden comprising basil, mint and marigold in the ground-floor flat that serves as the protagonist’s quarters, the filmmaker also revealed that she has passed on her love for nature and wildlife to her twins. The proud mommy indulgently reported that the 10-year-old pair is finding joy in rescuing injured birds and harvesting home-grown spinach.
