Raveena Tandon recently gave it back to trolls sharing her Mumbai public transport experience during the initial stages of her career. This came after one user on Twitter asked her what she knows about the struggle of the middle class in the city. It all started when Raveena shared her views on Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ latest decision to shift the Metro 3 car shed back to the Aarey forest in Mumbai. The user tagged Dia Mirza and Raveena Tandon and asked, “Do elite @Deespeak @TandonRaveenaknow the struggle of middle class Mumbaikars?”

Raveena was quick to respond to the tweet claiming that was also harassed and pinched, like many women, while using public transport. “Teen years, travelled in locals/buses, got eve teased, pinched, and everything that most women go through, earned my first car in 92. Development is welcome, we have to be responsible, not only a project, but wherever we are cutting through are forests, to safeguard environment/wildlife.”

She continued by adding that we all have struggled at some points in our lives, “Everyone’s life is not a bed of roses. Everyone has struggled to reach somewhere. I’m sure you have a house/car too. The day heat waves/flooding/natural disasters strike, it’ll effect the common man first. Elitists will be the first to run away to their Swiss chalet.” Further, her tweet read, “All development is welcome. All one prays is that more is done to compensate for environmental loss/safeguarding of wildlife. India today prides herself with tiger count increase, but because of depleting forest road/rail kills of leopards and tigers are increasing.”
