Scuba divers have found a primeval forest in the Gulf of Mexico which was buried under sediment for more than 50,000 years.   Ben Raines, one of the first to explore the place, said that the Bald Cypress forest remained protected in an oxygen-free environment and was probably uncovered by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Discovery News reported. He said the forest has such well-preserved trees that when they are cut they still smell like fresh Cypress sap.   The forest is about 18 metres below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and covers an area of at least 0.8 square kilometres, several miles from the coast of Mobile, Alabama in the US, reports ANI.   Raines’s discovery came about in 2012 after one of his pals mentioned that a local fisherman had found a place teeming with fish and wildlife and suspected that something big was hidden below. The pal dived and found a forest of Cypress trees and told Raines about his find.    The forest has become an artificial reef, attracting fish, crustaceans, sea anemones and other underwater life burrowing between the roots of dislodged stumps.    Carbon dating revealed that the trees are about 52,000 years old.   According to Grant Harley, a dendrochronologist (someone who studies tree rings) at the University of Southern Mississippi, told OurAmazingPlanet, “These stumps are so big, they’re upwards of two metres in diametre.”   The trees' growth rings could reveal secrets about the climate of the Gulf of Mexico.    Since Bald Cypress trees can live a thousand years and there are so many of them, the trees could contain thousands of years of climate history for the region, Harley said.
