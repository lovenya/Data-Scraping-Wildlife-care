On Tuesday, a 60-year-old tusker (in pic), who is also believed to have been one of the largest tuskers in Nagarhole was electrocuted after it ventured 10-15 km outside the forest and tried to enter into an estate. Volunteers say that estate owners, who border their estates with high tension wires to stop animals from entering are causing a number of animal deaths, this being one of them. The elephant was found dead in Hermadu.

A wildlife volunteer, present at the spot, says, “From its tusks, we can make out that the elephant was roughly between 55-60 years old. Most of the estate owners use high voltage wires on their fences to keep tigers and elephants from entering the premises. There have been incidents of tiger deaths too due to electrocution. It is high time that the forest department form strict rules against high voltage wires in estates near forest areas.” Tiger deaths have also been observed near Bandipur due to to the same even though the forest department allows minimum voltage for such wires. 

Conservator of Forests and Director of Nagarhole National Park KM Narayanaswamy told BM, “The incident did not happen in Nagarhole National Park. We have been taking several measures to reduce animal-human conflicts by setting up camps, barricades, solar fences etc. We have been conducting a census of the elephant populations every two to three years. Due to migration, the numbers do not remain constant. 

An FIR against the junior engineer of the electricity department and the land’s owner has been booked–Punati Sridhar, Principal Chief Conservator 
But there are a good number of tuskers in Nagarhole.” Principal chief conservator of forests Punati Sridhar says, “It’s another stray incident. The line sagged and the elephant got electrocuted. We are a booking case for negligence. An FIR against the junior engineer of the electricity department and the land’s owner has been booked.”
