Notwithstanding efforts by the government to conserve tigers, as many as 32 big cats have died in the country in the last over four months, even as the latest official data showed an increasing trend in the national animals population estimates. 
 
 Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan on Tuesday  said 18 of these were natural deaths, on the sidelines of First Stocktaking Meeting of Global Tiger Recovery Programs (GTRP).
   Meanwhile, in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister informed a total of 14 tigers were poached till May 2012.
   “Poaching is one of the reasons. Other reasons such as man-animal conflict, we are already addressing those issues,” she told reporters.
   Informing the House on the increasing trend of tiger population, she said, “The tiger population has shown an increasing trend with a population estimate of 1,706, as compared to the last country level estimation in 2006, with an estimate of 1,411.”
   Natarajan also spoke about the new forest reserves being established by the government to ensure a safe habitat for the tiger.
   “We are in the process of establishing more tiger reserves. Based on 2010 assessment, a new tiger reserve-Kawal Tiger Reserve at Andhra Pradesh has been constituted. Further, in-principle approval has been accorded for declaring the Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu as a tiger reserve,” she said.
