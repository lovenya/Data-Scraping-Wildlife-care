  The move comes after tourists complained about the recent hike in charges
 
 After making a steep increase in the entry and safari charges at the Bandipur National Park, the state government has reduced the tariff after a decline in the number of visitors. 
 
 In October, the new rates were introduced in most national parks and tigers reserve in the state and the entry fee and the safari charges were hiked. According to sources, when the fee was hiked, there was a sharp drop in the number of tourists. After a month, the entry rate has been slashed — from Rs 550 to 350. Also decreased are the safari charges and room rent. If Bandipur forest officials are to be believed, the numbers have picked up again.
 
 Bandipur Deputy Conservator of Forests Ambady Madhav said, “Yes, there was a dip in the number of tourists when we revised the rates. An entry fee of Rs 550 proved expensive to many. Most tourists complained about rise in safari charges and many foreign tourists expressed reservations about the hike in room rents.

 Keeping all these things in my mind, we approached Principal Conservative Of Forest(Wildlife) and requested to reduce the rates. With the government approval, the rates have been revised.”
 
 “Entry charge has been reduced from Rs 550 to 350. We are witnessing an increase in the numbers. Hope it goes up further,” he said. For the Bus Safari, there will be an additional fee of Rs 100 for adults and Rs 50 for children (5-12 years) and students. A safari now costs Rs 300, inclusive of entry fee. However, there is a separate camera fee under the revised norms and it costs Rs 200 for DSLR within 70mm lenses and above 70mm, it costs Rs 400 per trip.
