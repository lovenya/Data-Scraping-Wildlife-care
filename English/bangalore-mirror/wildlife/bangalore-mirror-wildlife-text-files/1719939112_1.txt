Wildlife experts got a happy surprise recently. The black leopard of the BRT Tiger Reserve has made its appearance again.
 
First documented in August 2020 in Forest Department’s camera traps, it has reappeared in camera traps set by Dr Sanjay Gubbi and his team of Holématthi Nature Foundation in BRT Tiger Reserve.
 
This male black leopard was also camera trapped at the adjoining PG Palya Range of MM Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in December 2020. The individual has been identified by comparing the rosette patterns on its body and is estimated to be about six years old.

A narrow forest corridor of 1.6 km connects BRT Tiger Reserve with MM Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. The documentation of this black leopard in both these protected areas further highlights the importance that the corridor is critical and needs to be conserved.
 
The Kollegal-Hasanur road (State Highway-38) passes through this narrow wildlife corridor and the vehicular traffic poses a significant threat to the wildlife and obstructs the movement of large mammals.

Now spotted at all 5 tiger reserves
Black leopard, a melanistic variant of the normal coloured leopard, is now documented in all the five tiger reserves (Nagarahole, Bandipur, Bhadra, BRT and Kaali) of the state. It has also been recorded in Nugu Wildlife Sanctuary adjoining Bandipur Tiger Reserve. In addition, it has been recorded in some of the forests outside the protected areas including Honnavara, Udupi, Kundapura, and other areas.
 
In Karnataka, the highest density of black leopards is possibly in Kali Tiger Reserve in Uttara Kannada as several black leopards are captured in camera traps set by the forest department. The black leopard found in the Kakanakote area of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve has been a big tourist attraction.
