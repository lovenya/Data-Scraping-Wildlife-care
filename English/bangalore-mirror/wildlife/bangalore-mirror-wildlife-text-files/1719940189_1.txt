Manoj K Jayan, a well-known actor in Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu film industries, makes a comeback to Sandalwood after a gap of 18 years. Jayan acted in Kannada movie Ugranarasimha that was released in 2005. Now, he is playing the villain in Rangasthala, directed by Eshwar Nithin. Its title was launched on Tuesday.

 “I am playing the villain in the movie. Kannada language has a divine power. I am Dr Rajkumar’s fan and have watched many of his movies. I want to thank the director, producer, and my friends for giving me an opportunity to act in Rangasthala,’’ said Jayan. Rangasthala is bankrolled by Revanna under the banner Aghora Motion Pictures. A majority of the cast are newcomers. 

“I hail from an agricultural family. I agreed to bankroll this movie because of my sons who live in the US. My son Vinod selected Manoj K Jayan to play the villain. I do not want to earn profit but only to encourage newcomers,’’ said Dr Revanna.

Eshwar Nithin debuts as a director. “The film will showcase the culture of Dakshina Kannada. The hero is a Yakshagana artiste while the heroine is a wildlife photographer,’’ the director said.
