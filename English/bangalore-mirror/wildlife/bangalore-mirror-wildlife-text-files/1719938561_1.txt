Snake charmer demands alms, threatens to attack family with cobra if they refused

It was a strange situation in Vidyaranyapura where a snake charmer and a snake created mayhem on Thursday morning. According to locals, a group of men were roaming around Defence Layout with a spectacled cobra in a basket. They would threaten to unleash the cobra inside the house if anyone failed to give them alms. 

It began with one family refusing to give alms to the man. The accused threw the basket inside the house compound, after which the family members raised an alarm and a mob started chasing the snake charmer. The chase went on for almost a kilometre where they were again caught and roughed up. A call went to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wildlife cell as well as the local police. 

 Rajesh, a wildlife rescuer said, “I rushed to the spot to see a snake charmer being beaten up. I then took him to the house where his snake basket was thrown. Luckily for them, the snake was inside the basket and had not ventured out. This was a four-foot-long spectacled cobra which has neurotoxic venom. Upon questioning, he said that he along with his companions had come from Gadag. Recently, they were approached to catch the said snake from a house and after the rescue mission, instead of letting out the snake; they started using the snake to threaten people for money. Now, the accused have been handed over to the Yelahanka range forest office.” 

Rajesh suggested that if anyone spots a snake, they should not seek the help of snake charmers, but call the forest helpline number 1926 or BBMP helpline number 22221188.
