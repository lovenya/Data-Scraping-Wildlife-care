Though the postmortem report from the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biological Wild Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the presence of HCN in the liver of the 15-year-old tiger, the exact cause of death is yet to ascertained and the miscreants responsible for it are yet to be hunted down.

  Following the laboratory report, the department has lodged a police complaint and also started an internal inquiry interrogating several guards and watchers who were on duty on the fateful day. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Millo Tago, Executive Director of BBP said, “The report mentions the presence of HCN but does not specify what quantity. HCN is a                                 A post-mortem report confirming the presence of HCN in Liver samples of Harrack          highly volatile gas and availability of it in the open market is next to impossible. It is widely used in the metallurgical industry. If it has been used then the miscreant would have had thorough knowledge of chemicals and the method of administering it too.”

The HCN angle has come as a shock to the Park officials. The food we get is tested and sealed by veterinarians before being sent to the park. “Only senior officials including RFO will cross-examine the seal and content before being fed to animals. This being the case, treatment of meat with HCN throws up several doubts and questions for which a detailed report on the nature of death will hold the key,” explained an official from the Park.

Wildlife biologists revealed that in herbivores one can expect the presence of HCN as several plant species have it. “But for carnivores it has to come through the meat only and keeping in mind the fact that there was partially digested meat in the stomach, HCN must have been administered orally,” a retired veterinarian from the University of Veterinary Sciences said. WHAT IS HCN?

Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or Prussic acid is a colourless, extremely poisonous liquid that boils at a temperature of 260C. HCN has a faint, bitter, burnt almond-like odour. It is available in the form of gas, acid and crystals. HCN upon inhalation interferes with iron-containing respiratory enzymes.

It was widely used by the Nazis in the concentration camps. It is also listed amongst chemical warfare agents that cause general poisoning and skin blisters.
