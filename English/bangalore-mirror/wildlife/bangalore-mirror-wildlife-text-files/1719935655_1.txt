With the long summer season around the corner, Bengalureans are getting ready to tackle the problems associated with it. One of the major worries of Whitefield residents is the spotting of snakes which come out in the open once the heat becomes unbearable. Since most have no clue on handling reptiles, residents of Wind Mills, near KTPO, Whitefield, have decided to hold a ‘snake class’, where experts from the BBMP wildlife will be main the invitees. The ‘class’, already fully booked, will take place on February 28, Saturday.
 		 	 		Experts say the entire Whitefield area once was a vacant plot, home to numerous snakes. However, the concretisation and rapid development activities affected their habitat and that’s one of the reasons why snake spottings are more during the summer.
 		 	 		A resident said, “We are really worried about snake sightings and it goes up significantly between April and October every year. BBMP has a cell and a training unit to teach how to deal with snake sightings. Training includes ways of identifying venomous v/s non-venomous snakes, how to avoid pet and snake interaction (which could be deadly for the pet), child safety measures, dos and don’ts in case of a snake bite, home and garden tips to reduce snake sighting and who to contact in case of snake sighting at your homes. The first training of 2015 in Whitefield will be held on February 28 and it is already fully booked.”
 		 	 		Sharat Champati, organiser, said, “The snake programme is organised at the Wind Mills. Being a wildlife expert, I feel that the programme will be useful for everyone who attends it. During the programme, we will have a talk on snakes, besides having a slide show.
 		
 		We want to drive a point that not all snakes are harmful. We also want to create awareness.”
