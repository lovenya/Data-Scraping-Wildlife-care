An IIM-K-graduate-turned-wildlife-photographer sighted a pale tiger in the Nilgiris last week. The last time a pale tiger was spotted was in the 1980s in Ranthambore.
 
 Nilanjan Ray, the photographer from Bengaluru who spotted the tiger, said, “I was very excited and I feel very lucky to have spotted something so unique. When I first saw it, I wasn't sure, but when I spotted it with another golden tiger, I could see the difference in the colour. But this is surely not a white tiger or an albino as he is golden white.”
 
 The reason for this unique pale colour, according to Dr Parvish Pandya, zoologist and expert consultant with Sanctuary Asia, is colour morphism which is a result of genetic variation. He says that colour of the fur is controlled by multiple genes and that random mating and varied genetic recombinations can result in this rare pale colour.
 
 Belinda Wright, a renowned conservationist, tiger expert and Emmy Award winning wildlife documentary filmmaker, has recorded one such sighting in the 1980s in Ranthambore.
 
 “I came back and informed the forest department about the exact location of the sighting. The department said that they would take necessary actions by tracking his movements with camera traps and ensure the tiger’s safety. The location cannot be revealed as this would attract a lot of crowd and there are chances of the tiger being poached for its rare colour,” Nilanjan added.
