A group of wildlife activists from the city held a silent protest at the checkpost of Bandipur Tiger Reserve on Saturday against lifting of night traffic ban on the highway (NH 212). They also opposed the plan to build an elevated highway, cutting through the forest. 

Over 150 wildlife activists and animal lovers participated in the protest, urging the government not to budge under pressure from multiple lobbies.

A protestor said,“Lifting of night ban will once again pose danger to wild animals as chances of them getting killed in accidents during night are more.” 

Apart from Bengaluru, wildlife activists from Mysuru, Chamarajnagar, Gundlupet, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have participated in the protest. Organisers say more protests are likely in the coming days.
