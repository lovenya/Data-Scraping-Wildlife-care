Rescued bird transported to PfA Bengaluru ICU for dehydration, starvation, and diarrhoea treatment

A unique bird, the Indian Grey Hornbill, was recently rescued in Bidadi. The rescue operation took place a few days ago after a concerned resident discovered the distressed bird and provided shelter until help arrived.

Upon arrival, the rescue team quickly transported the hornbill to the Intensive Care Unit at People for Animals Bengaluru. The bird was in a precarious state, exhibiting signs of severe dehydration, starvation, and diarrhoea. The wildlife veterinarians at PfA Bengaluru immediately administered subcutaneous fluids to rehydrate the bird and provided oral antibiotics to treat its diarrhoea.

Colonel Dr Nawaz Sharif, Chief veterinarian at PfA said, “The Indian Grey Hornbill, identified scientifically as Ocyceros birostris, is a distinctive species of bird. Despite the centre’s extensive experience in rescuing over 40,000 urban wildlife animals across more than 200 species during their 26 years of operation, this was the first time they had rescued an Indian Grey Hornbill. The bird is now under close observation, with veterinarians and rehabilitation staff carefully monitoring its vitals and food intake to ensure its recovery.”

The Indian Grey Hornbill is native to the Indian subcontinent and is easily recognisable by its striking grey plumage and large, curved beak. These birds are typically found in deciduous forests and urban areas with large trees. Their presence is crucial for the ecosystem as they play a significant role in seed dispersal, which helps in maintaining forest biodiversity.
