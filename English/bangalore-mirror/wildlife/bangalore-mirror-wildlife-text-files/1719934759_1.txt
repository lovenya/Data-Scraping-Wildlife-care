It’s not often that Bangaloreans get to see uncommon birds in the city. Hence, a white (albino) parakeet was a novelty for wildlife volunteers who rescued such a bird, which they suspect could have been the result of inbreeding.   The bird was seen near Malleshwaram’s K C General Hospital on Monday. Wildlife rescue volunteers were alerted to a stray dog attacking the bird. They learnt that another steel grey coloured bird had escaped, but the white parakeet with a red beak could not and had to be rescued.    The bird is now recovering from its injuries. Commonly found parakeets are green in colour with shades of red and blue.    White parakeets are the outcome of inbreeding, say experts.    Parakeets are protected under schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act and cannot be kept as pets. To hoodwink officials, those in the illegal pet trade carry out inbreeding in which case the birds turn out to be either blue, pink or white. Some even have a red beak due to mutation.    “There is high demand for these birds. They look like exotic species but are actually the result of inbreeding of the native parakeet species. Since only the regular green parakeets are covered by the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, officials cannot book pet traders from selling white, blue or pink ones,” Sriram T, a wildlife expert, said.   “These coloured parakeets are not often seen in the city. Even among the coloured variety, white parakeets are rare. We come across them only if they escape from captivity. I’m rescuing a white parakeet for the first time in the last six years that I have been doing this work,” Rajesh Kumar M, a wildlife volunteer who was part of the rescue team, told Bangalore Mirror.
