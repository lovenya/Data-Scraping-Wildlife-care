To avoid security screening, a wildlife smuggler allegedly abandoned two bags near a National Travels bus at the Kalasipalya bus stand and fled the spot. 

The men who were weighing the parcels noticed that two bags were left unattended and when one of them checked the bag, they found around 170 Star Tortoises in them.

The men then promptly took the two bags and approached the Kalasipalya police station and handed over the star tortoises which are a protected species under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. 

The tortoises were then shifted to the Bannerghatta Rescue Centre with the help of the cops.
