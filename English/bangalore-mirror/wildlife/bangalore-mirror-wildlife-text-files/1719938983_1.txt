Phase I of the All India Tiger Estimation 2021-22 survey was concluded at all the tiger reserves of Karnataka on Monday. The survey included sign survey to estimate carnivore and megaherbivore occupancy and line transect survey to assess prey abundance and habitat indices.

“We completed the survey as per the schedule and there were no untoward incidents. We have submitted the faecal samples to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).
 
Other data is being compiled and will be submitted shortly. The survey also included scat sample collections to estimate elephant, sloth bear, sambar deer and spotted deer populations. Ungulate density estimation and habitat survey have also been wrapped up,” said Mahesh Kumar, director, Nagarhole Tiger Reserve.

Conducted with the help of over 150 staff and across 56 line transects, Phase I at BR Tiger Reserve was closed ahead of time.

“We had planned the survey in two phases and completed it before the scheduled date. All the samples have been collected and sent to WII. However, we will not be conducting camera trap surveys this year as the last year’s data will suffice,” said Santhosh Kumar, deputy conservator of forest, BRT range.

Under phase I, three trails of five kilometres in each beat were identified to conduct the sign survey. This was done to record the direct and indirect evidence of carnivores and mega herbivores. A total of more than 45,000 kilometres was covered on foot in the entire state to conduct this survey. For the line transect survey to estimate prey abundance data and also record the vegetation and habitat details, more than 18,000 kilometres has been traversed across the state.

While the first phase is concluded in Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary and Tiger Reserve, BR Tiger Reserve and Kali Tiger Reserve, all the other 41 non-tiger reserve divisions will conduct the surveys between February 10 and 28.
