Unhappy with the steps taken by the forest department, people living in the vicinity of the International Tech Park have taken it upon themselves to track the ‘leopard’ said to be on the prowl in their neighbourhood.  With a leopard on the prowl, terror stalks families in IT corridor   With the help of a wildlife expert, they have developed pug impression pads (PIPs) at four places where the leopard’s growls are heard often. A PIP is a fine layer of sand laid in a path frequented by an animal to capture its pug marks.   The residents resorted to PIPs as they deemed taking pictures of the animal — as suggested by forest department officials — was impossible. They hope pugmarks on any of these PIPs would at least draw the attention of forest officials.   Sameer Teotia, a resident of Sai Colony, near ITP, said, “Despite repeated attempts by us to convince forest officials that there’s a leopard in the area, the latter are not helping us. Thankfully, a wildlife expert has offered to help us. Under his guidance, we have laid PIPs at our layout.”    Two people reportedly spotted the leopard at Sai Colony. Residents claim they frequently hear the animal’s growls at night. Out of fear, they have been closing their doors early in the evening and are not allowing their kids to play outside.   When they approached the forest department, the latter placed a cage near San Engineering, a company opposite ITP, without any success. The forest officials also asked residents to take photographs of the animal when they spotted it.   Sameer said, “PIPs will provide us concrete proof about the animal. Something should be done before anything untoward happens.“
