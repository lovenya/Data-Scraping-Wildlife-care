Hyderabad: A woman advocate in Telangana has exposed an alleged lockup death of a 52-year-old wildlife hunter. The High Court considered her petition and ordered a probe into the tragedy by Hyderabad city police commissioner Anjani Kumar.

According to advocate PV Nagamani, Sheelam Rangaiah of Manthani in Peddapalli district, along with three others, went to the forest on May 23 night. They carried high tension wire to trap the animals (usually wild boars).

The Manthani police found the group moving in suspicious circumstances and took them to the station and seized electric wire.

On May 24, the police officially announced the arrest of the four and declared that they were being remanded to judicial custody.

However, late in the night, Rangaiah died in the police station. The police, according to Nagamani in her complaint to the chief justice, described it as suicide by hanging self with a dupatta in the washroom early Tuesday (May 26) morning.

The police registered it as a case of death under suspicious circumstances and sent the body for postmortem at a government area hospital in Manthani.

Nagamani alleged that the police were pressurising the doctors to record no wounds on Rangaiah's body so that the case can be closed as a suicide. She said Rangaiah succumbed to the police torture.

She appealed to the court to direct the police to alter the case to custodial death (section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code) and murder (IPC 302).

The High Court directed the Hyderabad police commissioner to submit a report by June 5.
