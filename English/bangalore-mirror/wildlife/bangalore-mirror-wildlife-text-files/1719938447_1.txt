Good news for adventure seekers, Kodachadri, one of the favourite trekking spots in the State, will soon get a ropeway to help travellers and pilgrims reach the peak. Before Karnataka went into lockdown due to Covid-19, thousands would visit Kodachadri every weekend and the demand for better infrastructure had started to grow with every passing week.

 The Kodachadri trek is a moderately difficult climb, with dense forest on the way. One would require a guide and needed to have some prior experience in trekking to embark on a journey to Kodachadri. Many would also take jeeps up to the summit. The jeeps would pick up the tourists from their base point near Kollur Mookambika temple and then take the mud road to reach the top. This ride was no short of a roller coaster ride and many complained of back pain due to the arduous trip.

The environmentalists had opposed previous efforts of improving the road that would pass through the Mookambika Wildlife Reserve. Hence, Shivamogga MP BY Raghavendra has taken the lead in conceptualising the cable car project. As per the plan, the eight kilometre ropeway will connect the foothills of Kodachadri to the Sarvagna Peeta which is located at the peak. The journey would take less than 15 minutes. Speaking to the media, Shivamogga MP Raghavendra said that he was coordinating with various departments to take forward the project. The project will cause minimal disturbance to the forest and will also boost tourism activities.

However, many environmentalists have cautioned the government saying that they need to be very careful as it should not crowd up the hill and thereby destroy the environment.
