Bannerghatta Biological Park officials have cracked the whip on illegal quarries in the vicinity, which had posed a threat to wild animals. The move comes after Bangalore Mirror highlighted the threat to the elephant corridor in Bannerghatta in its September 5, 2011 edition.
 
 Besides a few that were permitted, several illegal quarries had come up inside the safe zone, which is one kilometre from the park. These quarries violated rules and posed a threat to wild animals, including elephants, leopards, sloth bears and sambars. 
 
 The number of illegal quarries had been increasing gradually, posing a threat to over 180 species of animals and birds inside the park. 
 
 Wildlife volunteers had complained after quarrying turned rampant in areas close to villages surrounding the park, including in Shivanahalli, Raagihalli, Kallubalu, Bukkasandra, Jaipur Doddi and Harappanahalli. The High Court had ordered shifting of quarries away from the one kilometre stretch marked as safe zone. Despite this, a few quarries had come up illegally.
 
 R Gokul, the Deputy Conservator of Forests who had confronted the mining mafia in Belekeri, said, “We have surveyed the area. Some quarries had been given permits before the formation of the safe zone. But, we have set a deadline of one month  for all illegal quarries to stop operations. Strict action will be taken against violators. We are doing this in association with the mines and geology department and the district administration.” 
 
 Wildlife enthusiasts welcomed the move. “It had caused a lot of nuisance. The elephant corridor that runs till Bannerghatta was most affected,” said Manjunath M, a wildlife enthusiast who lives nearby.
