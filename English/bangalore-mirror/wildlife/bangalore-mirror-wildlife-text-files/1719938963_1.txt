Injured spotted deer rescued in the nick of time at Hoskote is recovering well, docs say

A wildlife rescue, done in the nick of time has given a two-and-half-year-old spotted deer a shot at life. The deer was found lying motionless in front of a house in Jadigenahalli, Hoskote, 62 km from Bengaluru, on Thursday.

The residents of the house did not know what to do, it is said. They assumed the deer would get better in some time and run back into the forest after it is fed and had some water, but the deer did not recover.
 
It is said that the neighbours informed the forest department officials. The deer was carefully moved to a nearby nursery in Jagadenahalli, where it was administered first aid by vets, who diagnosed it with a spine and thoracic rib fractures. As the facilities were limited there, the local vet, along with the forest department officials, informed the vets at People for Animals Hospital, off Uttarahalli Main Road. A wildlife rescue team brought the deer to the city for treatment.

“It was a professional rescue. The deer’s eyes were blindfolded and its body was covered with clothes soaked with water to make its metabolic rate and temperature normal, and to avoid syncopal shocks which usually occur to sensitive wild animals. Sometimes, these syncopal shocks could easily lead to death due to shock. The deer was safely shifted to the veterinary hospital where x-rays were performed,” chief veterinarian and surgeon Colonel Dr Navaz Sharif said.

Veterinarians at the hospital observed that the nature of the injuries could not have necessarily been caused by a hit from a vehicle, but was perhaps caused due to a fall the animal would have suffered after jumping from a height to a hard surface.
 
After treatnent, the deer named Dhruv is progressing well and the vets are keeping their fingers crossed that it does not require surgical intervention.
