MYSURU: Nearly seven months after being closed for tourists due to the pandemic, the wildlife safari at Nagarahole Tiger Reserve is now open for public. However, foresters have restricted the number of tourists allowed per trip to 25 to ensure adherence to health guidelines. 

The safari was closed after a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. However in July, the authorities opened the safari at Kakanakote Safari Centre in Dammanakatte under Antharasanthe forest range. Kakanakote is famous for the black leopard sighting near Kabini backwaters. The safari services at Veeranahosahalli near Hunsur and at Nanachi Gate near Kutta bordering Kerala had remained closed. 

Safari resumed at both the safari points from October 11. According to foresters, there will be four safari trips. The first trip will be from 6am to 7.30am and second will be from 7.30am to 9am. The third and fourth trips will be from 2.30pm to 4pm and 4pm to 5.30pm respectively. 

Only 25 tourists are allowed per trip in the safari buses to maintain social distancing. Tourists must compulsorily wear face masks and sanitize their hands. The safari tickets for Veeranahosahalli and Nanachi Gate can be booked online and can also be bought at the counters. However, tickets for the Kakanakote Safari must be booked online only. 

Nagarahole Tiger Reserve director D Mahesh Kumar told TOI that there were complaints from tourists that they faced problems while booking safari tickets on the present website. “We are working to set right the problems. We are developing a new website where tourists can have all the details regarding the tiger reserve and easily book the safari and rooms,” he said. 

He added the safari at Antharasanthe has already started, and the safari at Veeranahosahalli and Nagarahole (Nanachi Gate) started on Sunday.
