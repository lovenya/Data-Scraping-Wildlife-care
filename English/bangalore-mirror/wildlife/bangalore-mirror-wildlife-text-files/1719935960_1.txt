A retired deputy director general of the Geological Survey of India is in trouble over possession of wild animal skins.
 
 The High Court on August 3, 2015, told the forest department that it should have taken possession of the wild animal skins that is with Bengaluru-based geologist BN Sinha long ago. Sinha had approached the High Court in 2011 after forest department had rejected his permission to retain the animal skins in his possession.
 
 The forest department on August 4, 2011 and September 21, 2011 had intimated Sinha that the possession certificate could not be considered as it was time-barred.
 
 No person could have come into possession of wild animal parts since 1972, when the Wildlife Act was passed, except from a person who had already registered it within 30 days of that law coming into force. Sinha was also directed to surrender the trophies to the jurisdictional wildlife range forest officer. He was given a second opportunity to voluntarily surrender the wild animal skins in his possession.
 
 In its order earlier this month, the HC has noted that though the petition was filed in 2011 no interim order had been granted.
 "If that be the position, the petitioner should have either voluntarily surrendered the trophies or the respondents ought to have taken possession of the same in accordance with law," the court observed. The HC upheld the wildlife department's stand that a possession certificate cannot be issued to Sinha.
 
 WILDLIFE ACT, 1972
 
 The Wildlife Act has strict procedures for possessing any 'scheduled' animal parts, cured or uncured. No person could have come into possession of wild animal parts since 1972 except from a person who had already registered it within 30 days of that law coming into force.
