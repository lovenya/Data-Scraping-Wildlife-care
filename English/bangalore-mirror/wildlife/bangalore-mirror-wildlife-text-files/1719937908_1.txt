Rescuers say they have been getting many calls about bats getting trapped in homes

Tvisha Prasani, a resident of Regency Magnum Apartments located on Hennur Road, had a minor shock when she lifted the blinds in her balcony in the morning. Three bats fell from the top of the blinds. 

“I panicked for a bit, but two of them flew away. The third one, a baby, is still in the balcony floor. I plan to call the rescuers as it is too small to fly,” Prasani says. 
With summer being quite aggressive this year, bats are finding new resting spots in balconies, on top of curtains and are even being found hanging from ceiling fans of homes. Rescuers say bats breed in the summer, so it is no surprise that they are entering homes at night and find themselves stuck there during the day. Most of the bats being found in homes are the young ones, who have no idea how to make their way back out. 

Aakanksha Singh, who stays in Richmond Town, too had a bat encounter. She says, “I had left the balcony door open at night. When I woke up, I found a bat sleeping in my hall the next morning. I didn’t know what to do. So I called a wildlife rescue centre and they suggested that I wait till it darks and the bat would fly away on its own. The bat did not leave till 8 pm that day so I had to call the rescue center again and they came and rescued it.”

Jayanthi Kallam, founder, Avian and Reptile Rehabilitation Centre, says, “We get at least two calls a day for rescuing bats found in homes. We mostly advice people to not to disturb them till the sun sets as they might go away when it is dark.”

Common pipistrelle bats, fruit bats, Lesser short nosed fruit bats, flying foxes and mouse tailed bats are the most common species of bats in the city. According to rescuers, a number of rescue calls are from Sankey Tank, Basavanagudi, HAL, among others. A rescuer from People for Animals informs, “Mostly, we find juvenile bats at homes as they are the ones likely to get stuck.”

Rajesh Kumar, founder Wild World Conservation Trust (WWCT), says, “Apart from being found at homes, we are getting a number of recuse calls for bats that have been electrocuted due to a transformer or a wire. We are getting 15-20 bat rescue calls every day and most of these are juveniles. Dehydration is another reason for the rescue calls. We try and educate people not to harm them when found at home as they are nocturnal species and cannot harm anyone.”

Bats, he said, are an important for biodiversity and help in controlling the insect population and in dispersal of seeds as they feed on fruits from trees.
