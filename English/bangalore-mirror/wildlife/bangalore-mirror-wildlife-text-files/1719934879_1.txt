Would you argue if a five-ton bully wanted to make off with your lunch? Gemunu the elephant is fast becoming notorious at his home in Yala National Park, Sri Lanka, for ambushing wide-eyed tourists and running off with their food. 
 A recent spate of thefts where he has used his trunk to search cars as they drive through the park has left visitors alarmed by his unruly behaviour. Wildlife photographer Aditya Singh, from Rajasthan, was at the park earlier this month when Gemunu targeted the car he was travelling in.
   The 46-year-old said, “I'm told that even as a baby, while Gemunu's mother was very wary of vehicles and visitors, he was always extremely !intrigued by them. As soon as he left the herd he started spending most of his time at the edge of the park near the Sithulpawuwa temple. While he was there he was fed by the monks and soon realised that the cars parked there usually had some food inside. Apparently he used to just pick at the food until about a year ago when he actually started raiding cars. Now it has become a regular habit.”
