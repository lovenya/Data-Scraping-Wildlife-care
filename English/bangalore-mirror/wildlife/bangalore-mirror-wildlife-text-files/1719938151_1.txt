The hunt for the elusive tiger in Bandipur has intensified but yielded few results. On Friday night, the tiger reportedly attacked and killed an elephant calf. 

The tiger has been sighted a few times during the search operations and captured on the camera trap images that the forest officials have set up to trace the tiger. 

When the search operations resumed on Saturday, the forest officials tried tracing the location where the elephant calf had been dragged from, but could not.

After an attack on a farmer on October 8 in Chowdahalli village, the forest department had released a statement saying that the “elusive tiger will be either captured or shot down within the next 24-48 hours.” This was the second attack on a farmer in less than a month, spreading panic and fear among villagers and farmers in the area. However the hunt for the tiger is still on. 

On Thursday, the officials saw indications of tiger movement in Hundipura village, located near the site of the attack. 

As wildlife activists protested against the decision to shoot down the tiger, the forest department now plans to tranquillise and capture the tiger when caught. The decision to shoot down the tiger was taken after widespread protests from the locals and family members of the deceased farmer. The forest officials have been continuing the search operation on elephants.
