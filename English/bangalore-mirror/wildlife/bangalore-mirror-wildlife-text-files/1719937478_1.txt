Hyderabad: On Tuesday evening, Jamuna, a 44-year old female elephant at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad, died of prolonged illness. She was suffering from sprain in her hind legs since March 14 this year.

 Due to immense pain in her hind legs, Jamuna was unable to sleep in the night. She was treated by zoo consultant Dr M Navin Kumar and was constantly under observation since March. She was also given antibiotics, pain killers and multi-vitamins boluses in the feed. Her blood, urine and fecal samples were also sent for laboratory analysis. 

 “We have provided doses of antibiotics to subside the kidney infection. The animal was kept under constant health monitoring and was under care to recover her health condition,” informs a Zoo official. 

 Wildlife veterinary officer from Coimbatore, Dr Manoharan, also visited Jamuna in April and prescribed diet changes and walk on the sand bed. The feeding and watering was normal but hind legs started showing problems like lameness. Later, Jamuna was unable to bear weight on her hind legs partially and there was lack of co-ordination.

 Dr Jayakumar, Elephant expert in elephant camp at Khoni, Kerala also treated the Hyderabad zoo’s one of the oldest animals.

 On June 11, Jamuna was shifted to the fodder plot in the zoo for better treatment to avoid the disturbance from the visitors. While undergoing treatment, she suddenly fell down in the wee hours of Tuesday and went to the lateral recumbence. Efforts by the doctors to revive her turned futile. She breathed her last at five in the evening.

 The post mortem lesions indicated severe congestion in her lungs, Myocardial hemorrhages in heart, congestion in liver, intestine, thickened edges on kidney and congested spleen. After conducting the post mortem, the cause of death was declared to be chronic respiratory infection, enteritis and enemiasis, as per the experts.
