Sleuths of the CID’s forest cell have arrested a wildlife smuggler who was trying to sell hides of spotted deer and seized three deerskins from him. The arrested, Dakappa, also ran a business of selling deer meat , said forest cell officials. Each of the seized skin is worth Rs 45,000 in international market. The operation was carried out in Shimoga district on Monday.   “The deal was to sell 18 skins said to be in possession with the poachers,” said M K Murali, Dy SP (forest cell).    One of the sleuths said, “CID forest cell got a tip off on the group involved in selling wildlife products, especially spotted deer. The gang operated from Anantpur, a place close to Shimoga, and smuggled wildlife products to different states. “The gang made a huge fortune by selling deer meat (Rs 500 per kg) and skins (Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 each. Based on this information, a trap was laid.”   Dakappa, who had negotiated a price of Rs 20,000 for each skin, was arrested by the sleuths and they are now searching for the rest of the skins.   “Possession of deer skin itself is an offence,” added Murali. “While one member of the gang was arrested, the local police and forest sleuths are searching for the rest of them.”   Spotted deer is a schedule III animal and is protected under Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. If charges of killing and wildlife trade are proved, this may land the accused in jail for two to seven years.
