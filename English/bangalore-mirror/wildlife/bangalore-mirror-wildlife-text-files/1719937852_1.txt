Still reeling from the aftermath of the Bandipur blaze, another fire broke out in the forests attached to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary on Thursday.

The fire has gutted hundreds of trees and destroyed dry vegetation but officials have ruled out any harm to wildlife. The forest department officials said that as soon as they got the news, they rushed to the spot and doused the fire. The cause is yet to be ascertained. 

Just a couple of weeks back, the Bandipur Tiger Reserve battled its worst forest fire; an ordeal that stretched over four days, and destroyed around 2,000 acres of forest to ashes.
