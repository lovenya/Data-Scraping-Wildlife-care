After claiming the pelicans at the park had themselves managed to get their feathers coated with paint, the officials of of Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP), now insist that one of them died later not due to the paint but due to other health problems. 

 	A deputy director confirming the death of the pelican said the paint on its feathers was removed, but it had died due to other health problems including complications in its thighs. 

 	A few pelicans and storks had become smeared in green paint after negligent workers painted the birds' enclosure a few days ago while the birds were still inside.

 	BBP complicated things by using kerosene to remove the paint off the birds' bodies. The pelican that died on Tuesday also underwent post mortem. While only the paint on the feathers was cleaned, the birds had also ingested fish that were covered in paint in the enclosure. 

 	But the post mortem report has not been released by BBP and officials are stonewalling queries about the fate of the other wild birds who were smeared with paint. 

 	BBP has come in for severe criticism from all quarters for not only causing the problem to the birds but also due to its subsequent handling of the crisis. 

 	It has stoutly tried to defend itself. “First, it (BBP) had no control over the painting work of the enclosure. When you are working with animals you need expertise. Subsequently, when they tried to remove the paint they made it worse by using kerosene and chemicals. There is no doubt that the pelican that died was due to paint. Once again, instead of making a public apology for their shoddy handling they are citing some other problem,” Mahesh Trivedi, a wildlife enthusiast who is contemplating legal action for the death of the bird, said.
