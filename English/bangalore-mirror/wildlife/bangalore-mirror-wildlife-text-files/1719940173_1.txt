Dog, snake bites register alarming increase across state, report says

The state health department recently released a quarterly report on the health of individuals in Karnataka. As per this report, the health department is facing a myriad of challenges as various diseases continue to pose threats to public health across Karnataka. Among these concerns, cholera remains a significant focal point, demanding urgent attention and proactive measures from health authorities.

 Cholera, known for its severe diarrhoeal symptoms and potential for rapid transmission in unsanitary conditions, requires robust surveillance and response strategies to prevent outbreaks and minimise its impact on communities.

“However, the health department’s challenges extend beyond cholera, encompassing a range of diseases that have shown worrying trends in recent data. One critical area of concern is the surge in Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) cases, which saw a stark increase from 117 cases in the last week of March to 3,390 cases this year. The rise in SARI cases highlights the need for enhanced respiratory disease management and surveillance protocols to address this escalating health issue effectively,” the report said.

Similarly, influenza cases have also seen a notable uptick, with numbers jumping from 48 cases in the last week of March to 358 cases this year. Acute diarrhoeal diseases, another prevalent health issue, witnessed a substantial rise from 3,093 cases in the last week of March to a staggering 36,814 cases this year. These figures underscore the imperative of targeted interventions and public health campaigns to curb the spread of infectious diarrhoeal illnesses and promote hygiene practices. 

The report highlighted that dog bites and snake bites registered alarming increases, with dog bites soaring from 3,093 cases in the last week of March to 36,814 cases this year, while snake bite cases surged from 177 cases with two deaths to 1,566 cases with ten deaths. These trends highlight the pressing need for comprehensive animal bite prevention programmes, effective emergency response systems, and accessible healthcare services to manage venomous snake bites promptly.

Among zoonotic diseases, leptospirosis and Kyasanur forest disease have exhibited concerning trends, with leptospirosis cases rising from 25 positives in the last week of March to 276 cases this year and Kyasanur forest disease cases escalating from 23 positives to 266 cases during the same period. These zoonotic diseases emphasise the importance of wildlife disease surveillance, vaccination campaigns, and community awareness initiatives to mitigate zoonotic disease risks.

Moreover, vector-borne diseases like dengue and Chikungunya have seen substantial spikes, with dengue cases soaring from 310 positives in the last week of March to 2,116 cases this year, and Chikungunya cases increasing from 73 positives to 464 cases. The emergence of malaria cases, Japanese encephalitis, diphtheria, and measles further underscores the complex landscape of infectious diseases confronting healthcare systems in Karnataka, the report added.

Notably, amidst these health challenges, the ongoing covid-19 pandemic continues to pose significant threats, with 82 positive cases reported in the last week of March and 5,968 cases recorded in the first quarter of this year alone. The persistent presence of covid-19 underscores the need for sustained public health measures, vaccination drives, and vigilant surveillance to combat the pandemic’s impact and prevent resurgence.
 
“The array of diseases and their escalating trends necessitate a multi-faceted approach encompassing robust surveillance, targeted interventions, community engagement, and resource allocation to safeguard public health and mitigate the burden of infectious diseases in Karnataka,” said an official.
