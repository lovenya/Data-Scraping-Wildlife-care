The photographs carried along with the report Captured alive on camera (June 26, BM) were superb. The top image of the tusker stretching its trunk and grabbing the man was really amazing. Manu   Muniraju should thank providence for the new lease of life. The frames captured by Vijay Karnataka’s photographer KS Sridhar are truly stunning. His presence of mind and courage to give the viewer something out of the ordinary are highly commendable. The pics can be compared with National Geographic’s best of the best.  Francis C J Smith   Such dangerous adventures should not be encouraged. One should not take the risk of going so close to elephants without proper training. People should be educated about wildlife and safety. KNC Murthy
