In a significant move to protect urban wildlife from the harsh realities of extreme heat and dehydrating conditions, the PfA Wildlife Rescue & Conservation Centre has expanded its Operation Quench Thirst initiative to encompass the critical ecological zone of BM Kaval Agara forest.
 
Spanning over 10 square kilometres, this forest reserve has become the latest focus for the centre to provide essential water sources for wildlife, mitigating the risks of human-wildlife conflict and ensuring the well-being of indigenous species. Launched in March,the operation initially targeted the Turahalli Forest Reserve. However, with the contribution from Divya Dinesh of the Ashraya Hastha Trust, PfA has now expanded its operations to BM Kaval Aagara forest. 

This move aims to address the pressing need for water sources within the forest, reducing the necessity for wildlife to venture into human settlements in search of water. Colonel Dr Nawaz Sharif, chief veterinarian at PfA, said, “By replenishing natural water bodies and strategically placing concrete water rings throughout the forest, we aim to provide a lifeline for urban wildlife during the scorching summer months. This initiative not only safeguards the ecological integrity of these critical zones but also minimises the risk of conflicts between wildlife, feral dogs, and humans.”

The impact is evident in the Turahalli Forest Reserve, where reports of wild animals sighted near human settlements outside the forest perimeter have significantly decreased over the past month. Furthermore, incidents of feral dog attacks on deer, often prompted by competition for scarce water sources, have also seen a notable decline. “As summer temperatures continue to rise, the importance of initiatives like Operation Quench Thirst cannot be overstated. With urbanisation encroaching upon natural habitats, providing water sources within forest reserves becomes essential,” said Colonel Dr Nawaz.
