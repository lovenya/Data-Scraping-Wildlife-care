700 trees planted by volunteers to restore habitat and mitigate human-animal conflict

IIn a unique and environmentally significant initiative, RR Nagar I Care, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, transformed a section of Kanakapura Road into a green haven for elephants. On Saturday, May 25, volunteers from across the city gathered to plant approximately 700 trees, aiming to create a dense forest corridor that will provide a safe crossing for elephants. This initiative responded to the ongoing expansion of Kanakapura Road into a four-lane highway with service roads, which had disrupted traditional elephant routes.

The plantation drive took place near the new overbridge connecting UM Kavale forests and the Devika Rani estate, an area covered with soil. The effort included a diverse array of saplings, generously sponsored by corporations and provided by the Karnataka Forest Department. Species planted included bamboo, Honge (Indian beech), Nerale (jamun), Lakshmi Tharu (parijata), and neem, among others.

Nivedita Sunkar from RR Nagar I Care, the organisation spearheading the initiative, expressed her enthusiasm: “This project is not just about planting trees; it’s about restoring balance and creating a sustainable environment for our majestic elephants. By providing them with a safe corridor, we ensure their well-being and mitigate the risks of human-animal conflict.”

Creating a dense forest corridor for elephants is crucial for several reasons. Elephants are migratory animals that traverse long distances in search of food and water. The fragmentation of their habitat due to road expansions and urbanisation can lead to increased human-elephant conflicts, often resulting in tragic outcomes for both humans and elephants. A dedicated green corridor ensures that elephants can move safely between forest patches, reducing the likelihood of accidents and fostering biodiversity.

Residents of Kanakapura showed overwhelming support for the initiative, highlighting the community’s dedication to environmental conservation. Chaitanya, a volunteer, said, “This plantation initiative marks a significant step towards environmental stewardship and wildlife conservation. It was heartening to see so many people coming together for a common cause.”
