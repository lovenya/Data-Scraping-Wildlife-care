Union Environment and Forest Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said that strict action will be taken against those involved in the killing of the pregnant elephant in Kerala.

The elephant had died after she ate a pineapple stuffed with crackers. She was standing with her mouth and trunk in the water after suffering an injury in its lower jaw.

Javadekar said that the Central Government has taken 'very serious note of the killing of an elephant in Mallapuram, Kerala.' 

"We will not leave any stone unturned to investigate properly and nab the culprit(s). This is not Indian culture to feed fire crackers and kill," he added.
