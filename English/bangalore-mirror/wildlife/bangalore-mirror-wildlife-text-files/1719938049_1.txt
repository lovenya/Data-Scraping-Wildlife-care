The carcass of a tiger was found on the side of the road close to Bandipur Jungle Lodges and Resorts in Bandipur on Saturday. The forest department took the carcass for a post-mortem, where it was found that the tiger likely died in a road accident as there were fractures in its face bones. Since the tiger was outside the limits of Bandipur National Park, the night traffic ban in Bandipur could not save it.

T Balachandra (IFS) Conservator of Forests and Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said, “The doctors observed facial bone fractures and so we suspect it is a hit-and-run case in the night. The tiger was found outside the Bandipur national park limits. In the last six months, there have been four tiger deaths in Bandipur, of which two were natural deaths. There have been instances of locals trying to poison tigers to save their cattle. We are booking cases against them. We are taking measures to reduce human-wildlife conflict in Bandipur.” 

According to him, the present tiger population in Bandipur is more than 135 and several new cubs too have been seen in Bandipur.

On the issue of poisoning of tigers, Rajesh Kumar, from Wild World Conservation Trust, said, “Tigers usually eat the cattle meat in 2-3 sittings and never at once. When they come back to eat the remains, villagers poison the meat to avoid further attacks. In some cases, locals also use high tension wires to keep off wild animals which can electrocute them. The forest department only allows minimum voltage but locals connect these to high tension wires.” He stressed on the importance of night traffic ban in Bandipur.
