Four circus elephants are caught in a tug-of-war between the forest department and the company which owns the pachyderms. While the forest department wants the jumbos to be sent back to the forest, the circus company wants to keep the animals. A legal battle followed and the Karnataka High Court, which heard the case on Wednesday, wondered if the elephants could now adapt to the forest environs.   The court gave the circus company interim permission to transport the elephants, but on the condition that they won’t be used for performances.One of the oldest in the country, Great Prabhat Circus was started in Tumkur more than 50 years ago. Its last stop was Kengeri on the outskirts of Bangalore. The circus camp was to move to Hosur in Tamil Nadu next, but an amendment to the Wildlife Act in 2002 has come back to haunt the circus. The circus has four captive elephants that perform tricks in the shows.    Every time the circus is shifted from one camp to another, the company has to obtain permission from the forest department to transport the elephants. However, this time, the forest department refused permission. In the 2002 amendment, circus animals were brought under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972). Hence, anyone who wishes to start a circus company needs to obtain the permission of the forest department and the Central Zoo Authority(CZA). Citing the amendment, the company was barred from transporting the jumbos to Hosur.   CATCH-22 SITUATION On its part, the forest department says the elephants would be kept in (forest) camps and the animals would live in their natural habitat. But the maintenance charges should be borne by the company which owns them (in this case Great Prabhat Circus).    The company says the amendment is applicable only to circus companies which started operations after 2002. Its advocate Mahesh R Uppin argued that both the department and CZA had denied permission to shift the elephants now, though they gave the nod on earlier occasions.
