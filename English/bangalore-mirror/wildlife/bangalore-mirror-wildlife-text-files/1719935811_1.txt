Will open streets be a reality in Bengaluru soon?
 
 	The state tourism department is planning to create open streets in the city to boost its tourism potential.
 	  	Open streets are traffic free zones, which the public can use for walking, jogging, cycling, dancing and skateboarding, and are primarily used as tourism attraction across the world.
 	  	Speaking on the sidelines of an event to announce the dates the 2015 edition of ‘Pacific Asia Travel Association Travel Mart’ (PATA), which is to be held in Bengaluru, the minister for higher education and tourism, RV Deshpande, said they are on the lookout for roads that can be turned into open streets.
 	  	“Bengaluru needs these streets as the city has people from different cultures,” he said adding that a couple of meetings have already been held with the home minister in this regard and there has been a positive reaction.
 	  	The minister said decisions in this regard will be taken in a crucial meeting with the chief minister on June 4. The open street concept has received an enthusiastic response at Cubbon Park where as part of Ciclovia the park is closed to motor vehicles for 24 hours on Sundays.
 	  	Now, the tourism department is using this to promote Bengaluru as a tourist destination. On an average Karnataka gets 5.81 lakh foreign visitors on an average per year according to the tourism department.
