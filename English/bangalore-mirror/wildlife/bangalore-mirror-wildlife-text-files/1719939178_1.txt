Ranbir Kapoor is opening up like never before and spilling the beans about his personal life.

The hunk, who is awaiting the release of his film ‘Shamshera’, sat down for a candid chat and had a bunch of puppies helping him spill the deets. While fussing over the little furballs, the hunk was asked to pick contemporaries he would love to go on a road trip with. Interestingly, he picked his ‘Bombay Velvet’ co-star Anushka Sharma and his football buddy Aditya Roy Kapur. “They are crazy people and lots of fun,” he said.

When asked who he would like to be stuck on an island with, besides his two obvious pics - Ayan Mukerji and Alia Bhatt - Kapoor said, “Let me pick a director. SS Rajamouli! So that I can con him into making a movie with only me, which we will shoot on the island,” he quipped. The star also picked football legend, Lionel Messi, to join him on the island and sai, “So that we can play some beach soccer and I can kiss his left foot.” The actor also picked singer Arijit Singh, “so that at night we can all party and hear him sing,” he said.

The star, who will soon be a dad and welcome his first child with Alia Bhatt, also gushed about his wife. When asked what makes him the happiest, he said with a smile, “Spending time with my wife.”

The actor also revealed his latest obsession which happens to be heading out into the wilderness on a safari. “I love to travel. I have become an addict to safaris. I’ve gone to Rajasthan, Ranthambore, Africa, I love the wildlife and just being in the jungle. You feel like an alien out there. I love New York and Kashmir,” Ranbir said.
