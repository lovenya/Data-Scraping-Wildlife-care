All 31 cobra eggs rescued by wildlife volunteers 51 days ago have hatched, which is a first for wildlife volunteers in the city. The rescue of snakes and getting their eggs to hatch is not new in the city, but the efforts were only partially successful till now, with most eggs failing to hatch.  Every year has two breeding seasons, and dozens of cobra eggs are rescued every season by BBMP volunteers. The eggs are then put in incubators to help them hatch. The results differ. Out of thirty eggs rescued on an average in every batch, only a few hatch. In some cases, every egg fails to hatch. The best result before now has been 80 per cent, said Sharath R Babu, a wildlife expert. 
   The latest batch of eggs were found in March by wildlife volunteer S Deepak. “The credit for getting them to hatch goes to Dhruvakumar R S, who cared for the eggs round the clock,” said Deepak. He said even in the wild, the mother snake finds it difficult to get all the eggs fail to hatch due to the temperature and moisture in the nest as well as predators like rats.  
   “Once the present batch of hatchlings are released in a conducive habitat, we will try to repeat the process with more than 60 eggs in an incubator,” Sharath told Bangalore Mirror  .
