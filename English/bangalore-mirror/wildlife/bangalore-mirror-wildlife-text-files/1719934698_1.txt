Diwali, the festival of lights that starts next week, is a celebration of life – but it means death for thousands of owls across the country.    According to Traffic India, an organisation which studies wildlife trade, hundreds of owls are caught by poachers and bird traders around Diwali. Though hunting and trading of all the owl species in the country is banned under the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, hundreds of owls are trapped and traded every year as they are associated with Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.    While the precise numbers of owls being traded for black magic are unknown, the conservation group said that the practice is putting some owl species under threat.      Myths about owls  Several black magicians (tantriks) use body parts of the bird, including its skull, feathers, ear tufts and blood in rituals to attract wealth and good health.    Tantriks mainly look for owls with false ear tufts (feather extensions of the head) as they are considered to have magical properties. “In an agrarian country like ours, the role of owls should be recognised and they should be protected. Owls play an extremely important ecological role by controlling the rat population and eating large insects,” said Abrar Ahmed, an ornithologist.   Traffic India has asked officials from the forest department, railways, customs and police to control the illegal trade of owls, particularly during Diwali. “They should carry out surprise checks and punish the culprits. We also need rescue and rehabilitation centres for the seized owls,” said MKS Pasha, associate director of Traffic India.
