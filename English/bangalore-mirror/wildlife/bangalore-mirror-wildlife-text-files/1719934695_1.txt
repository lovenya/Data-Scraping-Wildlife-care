It is not unusual for Finns to fly to Bangalore on business trips, on assignments and to make a fortune. But in an exception, two of them are in the city exclusively to volunteer for the cause of wildlife.   Mika Heinonen and Krista, both working professionals, involve themselves in rescuing snakes and birds, treating wounded animals before releasing them in their habitat and creating awareness about wildlife.    The duo arrived in Bangalore on Friday.    “They are part of our team that is into rescuing wildlife,” Sharath R Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, told Bangalore Mirror. “They first volunteered in 2004. This is their fourth trip.”    On an average, they will be attending to up to five calls every day. During their free time, they will go to the city’s outskirts to spread awareness about wildlife.    The biodiversity in Bangalore, which has several hundred species of wildlife, keeps more than 35 volunteers on their toes round the clock.    “They got in touch with us following a reference by Maneka Gandhi, a known conservationist and MP. They liked Bangalore and have been regular visitors. They are an inspiration to local volunteers,” said Babu.   The duo say that the diversified nature of work and the wildlife rescue setup makes them return to Bangalore.    Mika told Bangalore Mirror, “The city has got a rich treasure of wildlife. Working with the wildlife rescue team here is a learning experience. We like Bangalore for the way animals are cared for here.”    In 2009, he had picked up a stray dog at Kengeri, adopted the animal and taken it to his country.
