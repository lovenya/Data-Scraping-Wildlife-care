In a heartwarming rescue effort, People for Animals (PFA) swiftly responded to a distress call on March 17 concerning two stranded baby wild boars at an abandoned construction site near Sulikere. The rescue team, comprising Salman, Mohan, and Jagadeesh, sprang into action to aid the distressed boarlets.

Upon arrival, the team discovered the two boarlets trapped in a pit, presumably separated from their mother while seeking water. Severely dehydrated and sporting minor abrasion wounds from their fall, the baby boars were in need of urgent assistance. PFA’s chief veterinarian, Colonel Dr Nawaz Sharif, noted their condition and said that they were not dehydrated.
 
Promptly, the team administered first aid, cleansing the wounds and applying ointment to ensure their comfort and well-being.

To facilitate their rehabilitation process, a specialised enclosure was erected, providing a safe haven for the boarlets to recuperate and acclimatise to their surroundings. The enclosure boasts amenities tailored to mimic their natural habitat, including ample water for wallowing, slush for temperature regulation, and dry, loose mud for digging, which are essential behaviours for foraging in the wild.

Moreover, shade nets envelop the enclosure, offering protection from stress-inducing elements while ensuring proper ventilation. Inside, an artificial cave provides a sanctuary for the boarlets to seek refuge and security. As part of their dietary transition, milk and fruits have been provided, which will gradually shift to a diet of fruits, vegetables, and roots, supplemented with essential vitamins. Regular deworming treatments are scheduled to safeguard their health.

Dr Sharif emphasised the meticulous care provided to the boarlets, underscoring PFA’s commitment to their rehabilitation and eventual release back into their natural habitat. He expressed gratitude to the dedicated rescue team for their swift and compassionate response, highlighting their role in safeguarding wildlife in distress.
