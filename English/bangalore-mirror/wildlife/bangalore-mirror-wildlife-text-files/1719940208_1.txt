Citizens distressed as deliberate fires devastate flora and fauna; urgent appeals for authorities to halt environmental menace

The tranquillity of Banashankari 3rd Stage is under threat as miscreants continue to set deliberate fires, resulting in the loss of precious flora and fauna. Citizens near Ittamadu, Banashankari 3rd Stage, Hosakerehalli, who observed the incident, have voiced their concerns over the alarming frequency of these incidents, which pose a significant threat to both the environment and public health.

Harish KB, representing People for Animals, highlighted the severity of the situation, stating, “Very frequently fire is being lit in these areas. And it is causing a health hazard while even affecting the citizens around. This apart, there are many peacocks in the surrounding areas which are being affected due to the fire. Most of the trees are being lit and burnt.” Harish’s statement underscores the urgent need for action to protect the local wildlife and prevent further damage to the ecosystem.

The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has taken cognisance of the residents’ complaints and has written to the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) to intervene immediately. The AWBI emphasised the importance of safeguarding the wildlife in the affected areas and urged the KFD to take swift action against the perpetrators.
 
Additionally, the AWBI requested that the KFD provide updates on the actions taken to address the issue and ensure the safety of the local wildlife.

Residents of Banashankari 3rd Stage have expressed their distress over the recurring incidents of arson, which have resulted in the destruction of trees and the displacement of wildlife, particularly peacocks. Harish said, “It is heartbreaking to witness our beautiful surroundings being ravaged by these senseless acts of vandalism. The fires not only pose a danger to our health but also threaten the biodiversity of our neighbourhood.”

Harish added, “The peacocks are a beloved sight in our area, and it’s devastating to see them suffering due to the fires. We urge the authorities to take immediate action to apprehend the culprits and put an end to this environmental menace.”
