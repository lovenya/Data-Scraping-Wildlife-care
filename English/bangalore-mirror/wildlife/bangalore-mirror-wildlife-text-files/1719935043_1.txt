The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has initiated the process of the new tiger census. Last week, top forest officers of the four southern states met in Periyar to decide on the dates. Sources told Bangalore Mirror that the tiger census for Karnataka will officially begin on October 7, when 400 range forest officers (RFOs) and other senior forest officers will undergo a three-day training. They in turn will train nearly 1,200 forest guards, junior officers and volunteers. The final data is expected only by the end of 2014.
 
 
 The NTCA, formed in 2005 to manage the Project Tiger and tiger reserves in India, conducted two surveys; one in 2006 and another in 2010. They upgraded the method of counting tigers, which until then depended only on collecting pug marks. Apart from pug mark collection, the new surveys will count tigers by camera trapping methods which avoids double counting. In the last survey, Karnataka had the highest number of tigers in India, estimated at 300. The census found that there were 1,114 tigers in the wild in India in 2006 which went up to 1,706 in 2010. This is much lower than the 3,500-4,000 estimated in the 1990s. Karnataka overtook Madhya Pradesh in the last census.
 
 Gayathriprasad S Prabhu, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, said, “In the first stage of the new census, between November 2013 and January 2014, we will follow the line transect method where indications of tiger and its prey will be collected. Pug marks and scat of tigers and hoof marks of their prey will be collected. The second step involves the ministry of wildlife and the Wildlife Institute of India with the help of biologists engaging camera traps to caputre photos of tigers in the areas which have shown tiger signs in the first round. In the third stage, the data collected in both the surverys is uploaded and processed. The stripes on each tiger are unique and this helps us count the number of tigers.”
 
 Apart from the five tiger reserves, the census will be done in other protected forest areas as well. The entire census project in Karnataka is expected to cost Rs 2.5 crore. Dr Ullas Karanth's Centre For Wildlife Studies has a database of over 600 wild tigers which is the highest in the world. It will come in handy to identify the tigers.
 
 Between 2006 and 2010, Karnataka added only 10 tigers to its tally. But forest officials say that in the new census, the state could throw up a number close to 350. Prabhu said, “We feel the numbers will be higher as there have been many sightings of cubs. There is a churning in the population of tigers as the mortality rate is 20 per cent. The lifespan of a wild tiger is 14-15 years but the average life is only 5-6 years. A female tiger delivers 3-4 litters in her lifetime and each litter will have 4-5 cubs. But only one cub in each litter will live to the full lifetime of 14 years.”
 
 While numbers may rise, poaching of wild tigers has not stopped. According to statistics maintained by NTCA and The Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network, 72 tigers were found dead in 2012 and 48 till date in 2013. Many of them had died due to poaching and had marks indicating humans had interfered
