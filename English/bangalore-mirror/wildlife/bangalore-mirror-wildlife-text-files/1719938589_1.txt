The Chinese manja thread tangled on trees and overhead wires, continue to be a threat to the wildlife, especially birds. Recently, an egret and a heron with white plumage were trapped on a tree in Laggere, for nearly a week, before help arrived. The birds were rescued by volunteers and Fire and Emergency Services on Thursday.

Last week, a ninth standard student Yogith noticed a bird stuck and tangled in Chinese manja on a tree branch. On closer inspection, Yogith learned that many had gathered around the tree, hearing the cries of the distressed bird. 

“My neighbours told me that the bird has been stuck there for five days and had become restless seeing predators circling around him,” Yogith said.

Yogith narrated the incident to his Math tuition teacher Manjunath, who in turn informed a rescue volunteer Kiran Kumar. Kumar immediately visited the spot and also informed the Fire and Emergency Services for help.

       Video: After Ganja, Bengaluru’s big problem is ManjaRescue volunteers say there have received 110 SOS calls in the last 10 days related to birds trapped in ‘Chinese manja’, called so because this manja is imported from China.
After the Fire and Emergency services arrived on spot, Kumar, with the help of their ladder, climbed to the top and managed to untangle o Chinese manja from the egret’s feathers. Even after being brought down, the rescuers had to cut the threads tangled on to the bird’s body.

The bird was then shifted to the Bannerghatta Rehabilitation Centre for further medical attention. Yogith and his neighbours insisted that the egret, after recovery, be brought back to familiar surroundings. Kumar assured them that he would look into the matter.
