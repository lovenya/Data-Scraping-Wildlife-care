Rs 1,000 for first hour, Rs 2,000/hr for next two, Rs 3,000/hr for subsequent three, and Rs 4,000/hr after that

Speeding, honking, teasing wild animals, smoking and drinking by the roadside… it’s a jungle out there. But thankfully now, the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) has adopted some time-tested measures to ensure that motorists entering forests do not stray from their paths. 

Following a complaint by the Conservator of Forests and Director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve about the nuisance created by motorists who often halt inside the forests and create a nuisance, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) has ordered imposition of hefty fine (which runs into several thousands) on irresponsible wanderers. The order, issued a few days ago, directs forest department staff to note down entry and exit time of each vehicle; delay (which means one has stopped en route) or early exit (because the motorist has been speeding) will invite hefty penalty. The fine has been fixed as Rs 1,000 for the first hour; Rs 2,000 per hour for the next two hours; Rs 3,000 per hour for the next three; and Rs 4,000 per hour for the next six hours. (So, a motorist looking for a wild time in the forest will have to shell out Rs 38,000 if he/she spends 12 hours in the jungle). 

The time spent in the jungle will be calculated according to the length of the stretch and the legal top speed of 35 km/h.

According to the order, a copy of which is with Bangalore Mirror, all vehicles that pass through forest areas are registered and tracked through ‘Gasthu’ — an app based on GPS technology. “While letting vehicles inside the forest, the personnel at the check post would inform them of the various conditions like no stoppage, no honking, no photography, no teasing or feeding animals, no littering, no smoking, no overstaying and no drinking; they will be told to drive at a maximum speed of 35 km per hour keeping in mind the safety of wildlife. This would ensure prevention of roadkill too,” said a field officer from Nagarhole Tiger Reserve.

Seven major roads cut through protected forests of Karnataka; these include inter-state highways between Karnataka and Kerala and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Even though vehicles are allowed to pass through these forest areas only between 6 am and 6 pm under strict vigilance, vehicles are often seen stopping at regular intervals inside the forest for various purposes.

“Some motorists pull over under the trees for a smoke or to consume liquor. Others stop at regular intervals to feed or tease animals. Tourists often stop to click photographs of wildlife and landscape. While doing so, they not only litter but disturb wildlife too. Also, they end up jeopardizing their lives as a wild animal could attack them. There have been instances when vehicles or passengers are chased by animals. We wanted to put an end to all these illegal activities,” explained a senior officer from KFD.

While the complaint was received only from the Bandipur Tiger Reserve, the KFD decided to extend the order to forest areas across the state as it would also help in effective implementation of conservation programmes.
