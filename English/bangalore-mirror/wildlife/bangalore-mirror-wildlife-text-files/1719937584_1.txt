Wildlife rescuer spots Indian Green Frog in the city, seldom seen in polluted Bengaluru

Prasanna Kumar A, wildlife expert and rescuer with BBMP, spotted a rare green frog in Rajarajeshwari Nagar on September 26. These frogs species were native species of Bengaluru about two decades ago, but are rare these days. Urbanisation and pollution of water bodies with chemicals and frothing caused a decline in their population. Most of the frog species survive in fresh water bodies and drift away from areas where water is polluted. 

Prasanna, who has been a professional wildlife rescuer for 15 years, says, “I have seen this specimen after 20 years in the BBMP limits. I was driving at 7:30 pm when I encountered it. Due to the rainy season, it could be possible that it came out to breed. I moved it off the road and into a bushy area in Rajarajeshwari Nagar.” These frogs generally weigh about 200 gm and are as big as a human palm.

Prasanna, says, “When I was younger, I remember seeing this frog quite often during the rains. But they gradually disappeared. 

The drains are filled with garbage, roads have become cemented or concrete. This allows little space for water to seep in and thus reducing the habitat of frogs. This species of frog comes under endangered category.” 

He informs that though frogs breed during the rainy season, it is not the breeding season for them as they breed wherever there is fresh water and suitable habitat.

Pritham S, Zoologist & Research Associate from Karnataka Biodiversity Board says frogs are primary predators that play a vital role in the tropical food web and are also indicators of a good environment. “They also play an important role in controlling pests. 

Availability of large number of frogs in a given area implies good environmental health and lesser chemical pollution,” he says.
