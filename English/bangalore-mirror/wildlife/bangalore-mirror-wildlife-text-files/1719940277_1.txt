Darshan, and partner Pavithra Gowda, among 12 held in connection with murder of Renuka Swamy; investigation reveal escalating tensions and alleged abduction

The Kannada film industry is in turmoil following the arrest of popular actor Darshan Thoogudeepa and his partner, Pavithra Gowda, in connection with a murder case in Bengaluru. The couple, along with 10 others, was arrested by police investigating the death of Renuka Swamy, a 33-year-old man whose body was found near Sumanahalli Bridge. They have been remanded to 6-day police custody. Police Commissioner B Dayananda confirmed the detainment, stating that the investigation is ongoing to determine Darshan’s level of involvement.
The incident revolves around Renuka Swamy, an employee at an Apollo Pharmacy branch in Chitradurga. Allegedly, Swamy had sent derogatory messages to Pavithra Gowda, which escalated tensions. On June 9, Swamy was reported missing, and his body was later discovered in a drain in Kamakshipalya with visible physical injuries. A forensic report confirmed that Swamy was murdered.

“The deceased, a 33-year-old man named Renuka Swamy, was reportedly killed after allegedly sending inappropriate messages to Darshan’s partner. Several individuals have been detained in connection with the case, and during questioning, they implicated Darshan, leading to his custody for further investigation,” said the police.

Reports indicate that three individuals confessed to the murder, claiming they acted on Darshan’s instructions. This led to the arrest of Darshan and Pavithra from their farmhouse in Mysuru. They were brought back to Bengaluru for interrogation after Swamy’s mother filed a complaint. The investigation suggests that Swamy was kidnapped from Chitradurga, assaulted, and then killed in Kamakshipalya. Darshan’s involvement allegedly extends to orchestrating the abduction and assault, with his associates carrying out the fatal attack.

Adding another layer to the case, Raghavendra, also known as Raghu Darshan, the district president of Darshan’s fans association, was also arrested. He is accused of helping transport Renuka Swamy from Chitradurga to Bengaluru. The police believe that Swamy was assaulted on June 8 by Darshan’s associates following the derogatory messages sent to Pavithra Gowda.
This case has garnered significant attention, especially among Darshan’s fans, who have rallied in support of the actor, causing “DBoss” to trend on social media. Despite the gravity of the allegations, Darshan’s fanbase is demanding justice for their actor.

Past records
Darshan’s legal troubles are not new. In 2011, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife, Vijayalakshmi, but was acquitted in 2013 after they reached a compromise. In 2021, he faced accusations of assaulting a waiter in Mysuru, and in 2023, the Forest Department registered a case against him and his farmhouse manager under the Wildlife Protection Act for posing with a bar-headed goose, a migratory bird. In 2022, a slipper was thrown at Darshan during a promotional event for his film Kranti.

The murder case has brought these past incidents back into the spotlight, raising questions about Darshan’s conduct and public image. Despite his previous run-ins with the law, this case is the most severe, involving allegations of orchestrating a murder. As the police continue their investigation, they have increased security measures at Darshan’s residence in RR Nagar to prevent any potential unrest among his supporters.
