An image of a leopard, captured by a camera trap, is being circulated on social media with the claim that the animal was spotted at Banashankari 6th Stage in Bengaluru. 

The post reads, “Few hours back at BSK 6th Stage, Bengaluru spotted this beautiful creature-pls take extra precaution while travelling in that area (sic)”. 

Noted conservationist Sanjay Gubbi clarified that the camera trap image was taken by his team near Hebbur in Tumkur district in December 2019.

“Such fake news will create unnecessary panic and anxiety among people leading to a demand to capture leopards in that area. Owing to such pressure there are possibilities that leopards may be unnecessarily captured," he said, adding that fake social media posts are increasingly becoming a nuisance to wildlife conservation.

Sometimes, even some environmentalists fall for fake news and end up circulating such stories without understanding the larger context and the problem it could create for wildlife.
