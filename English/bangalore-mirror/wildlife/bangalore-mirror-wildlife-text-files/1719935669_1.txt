Over 30 of them have been chopped in the area abutting National Law School of India University and Department of Atomic Energy campus in the last three days
 
 
 Organised cutting and smuggling of sandalwood trees from the Jnana Bharati campus in Nagarbhavi is back after over a year. 
 	  	Amidst strict vigil around NLSIU (National Law School of India University) and department of atomic energy campus, in yet another large scale cutting of sandalwood trees, over 30 of them in the area abutting these campuses have been chopped down in the last 3 days. 
 	The modus operandi -- first cutting the trunk of the tree, and letting the stock and root to dry, to be later transported using firewood pickers; and the use of power axe -- are the signs of sandalwood smugglers in the act, wildlife volunteers told Bangalore Mirror. 
 	  	While one of the trees thus felled has already been transported, the rest are yet to be smuggled out.
 	  	The trees cut include premature and mature trees, which are cut and mostly used in making sandalwood artefacts sold for high prices in the market. 
 	  	Similar smuggling and large-scale cutting of sandalwood trees was reported last in August 2011, when over twenty five sandalwood trees were chopped in the vicinity of the SAI (Sports Authority of India) campus. 
 	  	After a Bangalore Mirror report, the forest officials, besides lodging an FIR had acted to plug all points used by smugglers to sneak into the campus spread across 1100 acres.
 	  	Although trees were cut and smuggled till 2014, it was not done on such a large scale. Tight security following a rape case and mass cutting of trees had prevented smugglers from striking it big all these days, but now it seems they are back in business.
 	  	“Shockingly, over 30 trees have been chopped down. Though all entry points are plugged, one point connecting Nayandahalli is used by smugglers to get into the forest. It is high time forest officials spring back into action as tough measures in the past had checked the smugglers,” Deepak Reddy, wildlife volunteer told Bangalore Mirror. 
 	  	He also suggested that either NLSIU, Bangalore University brass or the atomic energy department install CCTV cameras to check the menace. 
 	  	“The smugglers who have cut trees will certainly be back to get the trees they have cut. Forest officials should immediately act,” he said. 
 	  	Forest officials said action will be initiated to check the smuggling in the wake of recent incidents.
 	  	“We will be taking it up with the forest department to ensure an FIR is lodged and the gang is checked. It seems those who operated are back after giving a break for a while. However, we will act to check it as there are several hundreds of trees in the area that is a habitat for several wildlife species,” Sharath R Babu, honorary wildlife warden Bengaluru urban told Bangalore Mirror.

 			Sandalwood facts
 			
 			 				*Nearly 85% of the supply of Indian sandalwood comes from the southern states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala 			
 			 				*Indian sandalwood oil was a prime source of foreign exchange in the 1970s and 1980s, and this led to the indiscriminate felling of sandalwood trees 
 				 			 				*Veerappan was one of those who participated in the sandalwood smuggling racket that led to the trees dwindling
 				 			 				*The tree is already government controlled, and removal is prohibited whether on private or temple grounds until the tree is thirty  			 				years old
