A leucistic sambar deer has been recently spotted in the Sangama range of Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary during a study conducted on leopards by Dr Sanjay Gubbi and his team. The female sambar was observed in the company of another adult female sambar, leading to speculation that it might be a sub-adult individual accompanied by its mother.

This discovery represents the first recorded photographic evidence of a white variant of the sambar species within this particular landscape. It’s worth noting that a white sambar deer was previously documented in Bandipur Tiger Reserve back in 2014.

Gubbi said, “Leucism, the condition responsible for the animal’s white or pale skin, occurs due to the absence of pigmentation. It can be a naturally occurring trait from birth, resulting from a phenotypic defect during the animal’s development. Leucism differs from albinism, which is characterised by a lack of melanin in the skin and typically includes pink or reddish eyes. Leucistic animals, on the other hand, do not exhibit the characteristic pink eyes associated with albinism.

 Photographic records like this one provide valuable insights into the biology and ecology of these herbivores, shedding light on aspects that are yet to be fully explored. Sambar deer are categorised as vulnerable species according to the IUCN Red List, underscoring the importance of ongoing research into their unique occurrences. In a previous instance of an Albino dhole was seen in the same area.”
