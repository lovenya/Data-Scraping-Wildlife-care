We are surprised. How does an advertising professional carry a name like that?
 Since my childhood, I was called Pee Vee because there were three Venkatesans in our class in my school in Pondicherry and my teacher would call me PV. Even now my friends call me PV and might not know  who Perumal is.
 
   Why did you pick Begur Temple and Madiwala market to be photographed by participants? Begur temple is one of the oldest in Bangalore and the name Bengaluru was first spotted in the temple inscriptions in the 9th century. Sadly, many don’t know about the temple. We will shoot early in the morning to capture the sunrise at this lakeside temple. As for the market, going ahead, we may not see these markets because there are talks of demolishing them. Look at what happened to Russel market. 
     You capture street life. But most budding photographers hesitate to shoot people. I will motivate them and tell them how to shoot people. When you’re shooting wildlife and architecture, you can’t capture emotions. But shooting people can. 
   And you will teach them how to curate their own pictures.  Yes. They will choose five of their best pictures. Self curation is difficult. In a review session, we will talk about everybody’s pictures to bring forth different perspectives.
     What if someone wants to shoot with their phone camera? That’s fine. These days half the country’s population is into photography because of the mobile phone. You can’t expect everybody to carry a digital camera. I can give them my cameras also to shoot.
