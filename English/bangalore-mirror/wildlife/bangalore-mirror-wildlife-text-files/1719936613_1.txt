The Varthur police and fire department were sent into a tizzy after Balaji, a 31-year-old farmer at Siddapura village, alerted them about blood splashed near a well on his 1.36 acre agricultural plot in the village.
 
 “I have a plot at Siddapura village in Varthur. There is an open well inside the farm which is full of water. Every morning around 7 am, I visit the plot and water the crop. During my visit a few days back, I saw blood inside my plot. Blood was also smeared to a banyan tree. I got panicky and suspected that somebody could have been murdered. I immediately reported the matter to the Varthur police,” Balaji tld BM.
 
 The police who inspected the spot suspected that the body could have been dumped inside the well. The police team summoned personnel from the department of fire and emergency services. They decided to drain the water out of the well and it took almost six hours for them to complete the task.
 
 But instead of a body, they found a gunny sack at the bottom of the well.
 
 Inside was the blood-stained pelt of a deer.
 
 Police believe that the poachers had killed the animal to cook and consume its meat, which is considered a delicacy, before dumping the skin inside the well to hide the evidence.
 
 The police registered a case under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Hunting deer and consumption of deer meat is punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment. The police will take the assistance of forest department officials in the case. They will hand over the pelt to the department.
