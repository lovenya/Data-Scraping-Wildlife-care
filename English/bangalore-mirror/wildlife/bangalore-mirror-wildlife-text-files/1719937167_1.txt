The third edition of the world’s first barefoot marathon will be held at the Tata Coffee Sports Ground at Pollibeta in Kodagu on Dec 10.
 
 Cheppudira Nikki Ponappa, professional golfer, coach and founder of Coorg Wellness Foundation, said the event is being organised with Milind Soman as part of the Coorg Reconnect Initiative by Coorg Wellness Foundation.
 
 Ponappa said, “Barefoot marathon is an initiative through which we want the people of Kodagu as well as anyone who is a nature and wildlife lover to reconnect with mother earth and the best way to do this is by being barefoot. Through this event, we are trying to spread awareness about the rehabilitation of the elephant habitat and we want to replant the 54,000 trees that were chopped from Kodagu for a power grid. So, through the event, we hope to create awareness for planting native fruit trees in an eco-sensitive area like Kodagu. Our wildlife and elephants need to stay in the forest and enjoy their homeland.”
 
 The organisers are expecting about 500 runners to participate from all over the country. “While for the natives of Kodagu, cash prize is awarded, outsiders who win prizes take home produce such as coffee and pepper. We want people to come and experience Kodagu and take back Kodagu with them. The entire event is an eco-friendly event with a ban on plastics. Even water is served in coconut shells. There are no loud speakers nor do we use electricity. The warm up begins with the folk music known as the ‘Vallaga’ and people will have to warm up by dancing the traditional Kodava dance,” Ponappa said.
 
 Ponappa said the categories include one-mile run, 10 km, 21 km and 42 km.
