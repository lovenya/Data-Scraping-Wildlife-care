A 51-year-old man, Udhay Gopal Shetty, was arrested by Central Crime Branch (CCB) police for charging exorbitant interest and extorting money from people. He had recently brandished a pistol to threaten a man with murder, demanding repayment. 

Shetty, a resident of fourth cross in Wilson Garden, is owner of Srihari Enterprises and Muneshwara Souhardha Society. He had been financing gullible people through his firms and would charge exorbitant interest rates, ranging between 15 and 25 per cent. Recently Abdul Rehman, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, had filed a complaint with Sanjay Nagar police against Shetty. The complaint stated that Shetty had lent him money at high interest. 

Rehman claimed he had cleared his debt after paying both the principal and interest but Shetty kept on demanding more money as ‘interest’. When Rehman refused to pay any more interest Shetty and his associates barged into Rehman’s house on January 1 and threated to kill him with his pistol. The police commissioner, T Suneel Kumar transferred the case to CCB for investigation.

Police conducted raids on Srihari Enterprises and Muneshwara Souhardha Society simultaneously and seized Rs 5.76 lakh, a pistol and four live bullets from the premises. Police also found documents of different properties, blank cheque leaves, bond papers along with deer antlers. The police have sent a report to the Forest department to take up a separate case under Wildlife Act. 

According to police, Shetty use to finance people by taking property, blank cheques and bond papers as surety. He used to threaten people so that they would pay higher interest than the rate agreed upon at the time of taking the loan. He would threaten them with dire consequences to make them cough up the money. Verification of the pistol licence and further investigation are on.
