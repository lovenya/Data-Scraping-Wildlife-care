With reference to the report Forest department splurges Rs 20L on Kumble’s chambers (July 8, BM), cricket may be a widely-popular sport in India but that should not mean ex-players can be glorified with high positions in establishments where they cannot claim any expertise. Forests are not cricket stadia! Furnishing an office by spending Rs 20 lakh when its occupant, Anil Kumble, is a part-time wildlife board vice-chairman was totally unwise and callous on the forest department’s part. Poda De   Kumble should have objected to the spending of Rs 20 lakh on his office chamber and instead advised the forest department to spend that sum on afforestation. A S Raj   The forest department splurging big bucks is not surprising. It is ground reality — officials ignore the basic needs of the men on field. The story also raises the question whether corporate donors are checking how their money is being spent. Had Kumble taken his job as State Board for Wildlife vice-chairman seriously, he could have averted such misuse of funds. The new principal chief conservator’s statement that he would take corrective measures sounds hollow. Can he get back the Rs 20 lakh spent on Kumble’s chambers by dismantling all the CFL fittings, ACs, etc?  John D'Cruz Gomes   RTI activist Arul Raj deserves a big applause for exposing the misuse of money by the forest department. This is another classic example of how taxpayer’s money is squandered. P S Sukumaran
