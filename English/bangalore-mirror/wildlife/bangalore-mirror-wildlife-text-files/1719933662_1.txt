Even as the number of people embarking on trekking expeditions is on the rise, casualties too seem to be increasing at an alarming rate.

Take, for instance, the death of Chandrashekhar, a ‘trek-trainer’, who also owns a trekking club in the city. He died during his weekend adventure trip to Khanapur and Vajra forests in Belgaum district.

Experts say such incidents are increasing due to lack of awareness among the people. “The adventure travel industry is not an organised one in India. Yesterday’s volunteer is today’s instructor. It’s unsafe for people who go with those who are not qualified,” said Ashok Kumar of Ozone, an adventure firm in Bangalore.

Stating that 10 out of the 30-plus adventure clubs don’t have a qualified instructor, Ashok said they need to be regulated. 

“I’ve suggested to the tourism department to bring in a licence system that certifies only professional firms to undertake adventure activities.”

As the incident occurred near or within the reserve forests of Karnataka, Bangalore Mirror contacted I B Srivastava, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), who had no reports of any such incident. “The forest department has identified trails in the jungles and to trek along these paths, one requires prior permission from the DCF of the forest range,” said Srivastava.

Not just that. “A local guide will be appointed. There are restrictions on timings and one needs to get out of the forests within the stipulated time. Even if people are using ‘unidentified paths’ to get to the other side or village, it is advisable to inform the local Range Forest Officer,” said Srivasatava.
