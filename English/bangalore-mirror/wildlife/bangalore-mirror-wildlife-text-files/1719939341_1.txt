A member of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has written to the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Chikballapur Taluk, regarding illegal trapping, transportation and display of a rat snake in Chikaballapur by Sadhguru.
 
The member alleged that Sadhguru was in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), 1972.
 
“The snake was displayed on stage by Sadhguru. However, it is yet to be handed over to the Forest Department,” read the letter, a copy of which is with BM.
 
“Immediate action must be taken against Sadhguru to control his mindless destruction of wildlife and nature, else, his followers will continue to do the same,” it said.
