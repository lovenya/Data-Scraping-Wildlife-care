Thoroughly brushing its teeth before indulging in a sleepy yawn, this bleary eyed orangutan bears an uncanny resemblance to the morning routines of many human beings. Siswi was captured demonstrating impeccable oral hygiene in Tanjung Puting National Park in Borneo, Indonesia.   The 34-year-old female likes to remain minty fresh by using a toothbrush to scrub her impressive set of teeth, and is regularly spotted sporting a mouthful of foam at the Camp Leakey wildlife refuge. She now brushes her teeth nearly every day after tucking into her meals of fruit, leaves and bark. She has been filmed sharing a bowl of noodles with one keeper.   German photographer Jurgen Freund, 53, visited the national park while on a trip to observe the rainforest and its inhabitants in Indonesia. “I thought these primates were so much like us,” he said. “They are so intelligent and so observant of human behaviour. We saw Siswi brushing her teeth with a toothbrush and the toothpaste made her yawn,” he told Daily Mail.   Freund said orangutans live semi-wild in the jungles of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia and learn to mimic the mannerisms of tourists that flock to the region to catch a glimpse of the mighty apes.
