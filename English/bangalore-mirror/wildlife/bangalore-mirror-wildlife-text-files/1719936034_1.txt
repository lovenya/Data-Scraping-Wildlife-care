A tip-off from Wildlife Crime Control Bureau helped forest officials of Kodihalli range of Bannerghatta National Park division nab a culprit with one kg of pangolin scales. The accused Nagaraju, who hails from Ramanagaram, had smuggled the scales from across Hosur border. The 45-year-old was produced before the local court in Kanakapura on Sunday evening. If found guilty he could be sentenced to seven years in jail. 
 
 According to the wildlife bureau, regional deputy director Venkatesh Murthy laid a trap for the approaching smugglers on the outskirts of Hosur town. “The accused came in a bus and got off near Hosur border which were intercepted by the lurking forest team. When he tried to escape, forest officials, who had split into three teams, rushed and captured him,” he said. 
 	  	Deputy conservator of forests (Bannerghatta National park division) Sunil Pawar said, “During interrogation, Nagaraju did not reveal anything about middlemen involved in the activity. The investigation is on.” This is the first case of Pangolin scales being smuggled and sold in this division. Usually pangolin scales are found near the Western Ghats like Karwar, Chikkamagaluru and its surrounding regions, says one of the forest officials.
