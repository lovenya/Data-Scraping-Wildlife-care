Residents, volunteers spent the weekend painting the lake’s boundary wall to promote conservation

Seegehalli Lake came to life with a splash of colour on Sunday. Residents and volunteers from the Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) came together to paint the boundary walls of the lake. The activity was organised by EFI, which has been carrying out wall-painting and cleanliness drives at lakes and parks since 2011.

“Around 10 volunteers from corporate offices and the localities around the lake joined us. A number of children from the nearby areas joined in as well. 
None of us are professional painters. The theme was environment conservation. Next week we will choose another lake in the city to paint its walls. 
This is also a way to de-stress oneself over the weekend,” said Abel Santhosh, conservation coordinator, EFI. 

At Seegehalli Lake, the volunteers arrived at the consensus of painting a crying earth, littered all over. The idea was to convey the message of keeping the lake clean. “Last week, I painted a wall at Devasandra Lake along with other volunteers from EFI. This is my second wall-painting activity. Since I am an artist too, this is the best way I could spend my weekend pursuing my hobby while also contributing my bit towards nature. It is a great unwinding activity,” said Pushkal B, a Jayanagar resident. 

The lake guardians at Seegehalli Lake have been trying to convert the lake into a model lake by installing bird perches, developing cycling zones for kids, yoga zones and nature gyms and by planting thousands of saplings all over. The wall-painting activity was part of this effort, in which EFI came on board as supporters. 

With about 50 volunteers in Bengaluru, EFI is a self-funded wildlife conservation and habitat restoration voluntary group. They organise street plays, wall-painting activities at lakes, cleanliness drives through lake safaris and town hall sessions to spread the message of environmental conservation.
