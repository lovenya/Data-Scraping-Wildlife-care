THE CLAIM

News and photographs of charred animals being circulated on social media, claiming that wildlife has been lost in the forest fire at Bandipur.

SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH?

“No wild animal death is reported so far in the forest fire at BNP. Pictures of charred animals circulated on social media and other media are far from the truth. No dead animals have been seen so far during fire fighting operations,” said Shivraj Singh, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest.
