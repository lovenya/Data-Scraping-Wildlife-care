Top Kannada producer Rockline Venkatesh is in a spot as the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) has recommended police action against him for using wildlife species during the making of TV serials at his studio. 
 The PCCF also sought action against producers and directors of the serials - one based on mythology and another a reality show - being shot for a private channel at Rockline Studio at Nagasandra in violation of the Indian Wildlife Act, 1972. 
 Based on information about illegal possession, exhibition and usage of wildlife species such as cobra, rat snakes, Alexandrine Parakeets and rose-ringed parakeets, all endangered species, the wildlife sleuths had conducted a raid on the studio. They indeed found these species there. 
 During the raid, the sleuths had also seized an album showing several actors, including Puneeth Rajkumar, Sudeep, Darshan, Chiranjeevi, Simbu, Arjun Sarja, Murali and Diganth, using wildlife species being supplied by the same person at Rockline Studio.  
 A case was registered and one, Yeshwanthpur Babu, was arrested in this connection.  
 But no action was taken against producers and the studio owner. 
 Following reports that snakes had been defanged, their venom sacks punctured and their mouths stitched up for the purpose of shooting, animal activist Maneka Gandhi had written to the PCCF. 
 The PCCF, in turn, shot off a letter to Press Council chief Markandeya Katju on April 16 seeking his intervention in checking the private channels from using wildlife species for entertainment.
