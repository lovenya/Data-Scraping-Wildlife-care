The 14-year-old black buck poaching case has come back to haunt Salman Khan again. A Jodhpur court has summoned the actor and three others to appear before it on February 4, 2013. Salman was framed under relevant sections of the Wildlife Act, the Arms Act and the IPC while the others (who were with him during the incident), including Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre, Neelam, Dushyant Singh and Dinesh Gawre, were framed under the Wildlife Act and the IPC, defence counsel Hastima Saraswat said.   However, after a revision petition filed at the session court by the accused, certain charges were lifted. According to Saraswat, the state government then filed a revision petition in the Rajasthan High Court, which upheld the session court’s decision in Salman’s case, but added a charge against the others that the lower court had dropped. Fourteen years ago, in September 1998, during the shooting of Rajshri Productions’ Hum Saath Saath Hain, two endangered black bucks were allegedly poached at Kankani village near Jodhpur.   All the accused had last appeared in the lower court on June 19, 2006, but revision petitions first by the defence and then by the state government had held up the trial.   Salman was convicted and sentenced to 1-year and 5- year prison terms in separate cases of poaching of two Chinkaras at Bhawad and one Black Buck at Ghoda Farm (Mathania). Appeals against these sentences, both by Salman and the state government, had been pending in the High Court since long. And now, the trial will begin again in the lower court with the revised charges for which the court has summoned all the accused on February 4.
