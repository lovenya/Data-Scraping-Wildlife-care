After NGOs failed to respond, Banashankari woman posts about injured bird and gets help

When Reya Athreya saw a pond heron entangled in manja strings of a kite, hanging upside down from a tree, she decided to approach NGOs first. None responded and Athreya posted about the bird on social media. 

In 30 minutes, wildlife rescuer Rashmi Mavilkurve got in touch with her. She roped in Somu HN and reached Athreya’s house immediately. The tree from which the heron was hanging is quite tall.

“It was quite dark when we reached the spot and climbing such a tall tree was not even an option. We couldn’t even make out as to how the bird was stuck,” said Mavilkurve.

Along with Somu, Mavilkurve approached the residents of a building next to the tree for access to their terrace. “From the terrace, we could see the bird’s feather was totally entangled in green manja. We could not reach the tree and so, we approached the fire brigade team of Padmanabhanagar. The team was very supportive and reached in 15 minutes,” said Somu. The whole rescue operation took about 1hour 30 minutes.

The firemen shook the bird down and Somu caught it from the first floor of the house. ‘We slowly removed the string and checked if there was any injury. Luckily, there was no injury but the bird was dehydrated. We couldn’t leave the bird in that condition and birds have a low vision in the night so it was not safe for us to let go of it. So, I took the bird to my house,” said Mavalikure. The bird was released on Wednesday near Uttarahalli lake.
