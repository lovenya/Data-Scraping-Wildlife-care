About 400 persons came together to clean up Bannerghatta National Park and its adjoining forest area at Ragihalli on Tuesday. The drive was organised as part of Wildlife Week by Bengaluru-based NGO Wildlife SOS.

The Wildlife SOS team, which manages Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre, collaborated with Bannerghatta National Park. Students, volunteers, local stakeholders and Wildlife SOS’ CSR partners along with Central Reserve Police Force staff and eco-volunteer groups of the Karnataka Forest Department ended up collecting almost 15 tractor loads of garbage from both the sites.

Wildlife SOS Director-Research & Veterinary Operations Dr Arun A Sha conducted a public awareness talk among shopkeepers and residents of Bannerghatta to address the issue of plastic pollution. This was accompanied by a skit performance by one of the volunteer groups.

“Single-use-plastic items have become a critical threat to our planet as they are choking our oceans, seas, rivers and lakes,” he said. 

Dr Arun said, “We must work together to make the earth cleaner and greener. It was extremely heartening as well as rewarding for our team to receive such a wonderful response from public and volunteers who participated in the event.”
