The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled out tourism activity in the core zones of tiger reserves across the country, bringing the curtains down on the booming industry in the state. Referring directly to states, including Karnataka, which have been dangling tigers to lure tourists, the SC bench ruled, “We make it clear that till the final directions are issued by this court, the core zones or areas in the tiger reserves will not be used for tourism.”   Jungle Lodges and Resorts (JLR), the state government-run enterprise which has cottages in Bandipur and Nagarahole, both tiger reserves, is assessing the impact of the ruling. Officials are worried that the ruling could be detrimental for its resorts in other locations too.    JLR managing director P Anur Reddy said, “ The order per se is very sad and bad. People will forget about the existence of animals like tigers in our forests. Tourism in the tiger reserves of Karnataka has always been regulated. The National Tiger Conservatory Authority (NTCA) will soon hold the meeting of chief wildlife wardens across India to discuss the ruling.”   Yet another forest official said, “Tourists have been visiting Bandipur and Nagarahole since 1973. There has been no violation of rules.” Earlier, the government had argued that if JLR’s resort in K Gudi had to be shut, then so should those in other tiger reserves, like Jim Corbett Park (Uttarakhand), Kanha (MP), Ranathambore(Rajasthan) and Periyar (Kerala).
