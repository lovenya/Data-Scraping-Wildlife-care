Always wondered what actors do in their free time and how they live a day without work? Read on to know more on Suman Rangathan, who leads an exceptionally wonderful life and takes time off to explore different things.   Beauty secrets: A positive mind.

Fashion to you is: I know it’s been said many a times, but it is just about being comfortable. And, I always keep telling 
people to wear their attitude, and it will show.

About Bangalore: I am so grounded to the city because I’ve such fond memories with my friends and cousins here.

Favourite hang-out: I love the atmosphere of Bangalore Club.

Hobbies: Too many to count on. But off late, I’ve got my hands on pottery and have learnt the art. I even studied painting and I often go out of Bangalore just to capture the beauty of nature and wildlife.  

About books: I’ve started reading a lot of fiction. But now it fascinates me to live the characters as I am reading. And at times it totally takes me by awe as to how these writers imagine and write such wonderful stories. I have just finished reading, The Time Traveler’s Wife  and The Memory Keeper’s Daughter.

A day without work: The day I am not working, I relax. Either I  go to the gym or just play an outdoor sport. Otherwise, I 
simply catch up with my cousins and friends or simply sit back and watch a film or read a book.

What do you look for in a man: I want a person who adds life to my life and makes me feel happy. 

Near future: I just see myself doing more and more films. I haven’t kept myself constrained with just the big screen. I am open to do television, and I even model if my designer friends ask me to do so. 

Five years down the lane: I see myself with a family and having kids.
