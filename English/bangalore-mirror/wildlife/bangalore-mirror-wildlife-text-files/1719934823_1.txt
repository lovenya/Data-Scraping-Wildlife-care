An NGO named Vanya and the forest department are inviting volunteers to assist in fire prevention at Bandipur National Park. The volunteers will be expected to patrol the edge of the forest, stay put on watch towers, report fires and provide logistical and humanitarian support. The activity will be from March 16 to May-end 
 Praveen Ram of Vanya dismissed the popular belief that forest fires occur naturally and also benefit the forest. He said that frequent fires degrade the habitat in numerous ways, including by causing an increase in fire-resistant plants which are non-palatable to wild herbivores and destroying seeds. Stretches affected by fires frequently boast of tall trees but lack small plants. When the trees wither, the land turns barren. Reduced palatable fodder affects wildlife and reduced natural cover results in the area being abandoned.
