 ​IISc study paints a grim picture of the buffer zone around BNP; 60 per cent of land in 1 km radius of the park has been encroached upon; area’s flora and fauna are under threat, it says 
 
 
 

 	A lack of political will, coupled with growing human greed for land, has accentuated the extent of the damage caused to the ecologically sensitive Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), located around 25 km from the city. Illegal sand mines and stone quarries thrive in the area due to constant land use change in the buffer zones around the national park.
 	
 	  	A recent study taken up on the BNP buffer zone by the Energy and Wetlands Group, at the Centre for Ecological Sciences at Indian Institute of Science, on the ecologically-sensitive zones around the BNP, shows that out of total 8,938. 56 hectares, around 5,655.17 hectares has been encroached upon over a period of time as the state government played mute spectator.
 	
 	  	Recently, many incidents of illegal poaching, stone quarrying and sand mining have been reported in the area, but locals say that the village panchayat and the police are reluctant to act as it is all carried out under the umbrella of political protection.
 	
 	  	Generally, when roads are built in the city, contractors tend to drag their feet with the work, but inside the forest, contractors are efficient to a fault. Recently, while carrying out road repair work in the reserve forest area, the contractor filled the drains on either side of the existing road in an attempt to increase its width to ease truck movement to and from the stone quarries.
 	
 	  	Deputy Conservator of Forests Sunil Panwar said, “It has been brought to my notice and I have warned the contractor that the width of the road can’t be extended and they will have to clear the rubble that has been put in the drains and tar only the 3.75 metre-width.”
 	
 	  	However, the recent study establishes that encroachment has been going on for ages and now has reached a level where it is threatening the very existence of the BNP. From 2009 till December 2014, the forest department has shelled out Rs 21,30,907 as compensation to humans due to damage from man-animal conflict.
 	
 	  	Environmentalists fear that this rampant encroachment will increase this conflict and the government will be forced into creating draconian laws that will allow the culling of animals as the environment ministry has done recently.
 	
 	  	The study done by the IISc using satellite imagery shows that a majority of gomala lands have been encroached by quarries and mines, while other parts have been demarcated by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) for housing settlements.
 	
 	  	The land analysis that covers five kilometers of the buffer zone from the BNP boundary shows that moist deciduous forest which once covered 50.4 per cent of the area in 1973 had come down to 28.5 per cent in 2015 due to human interference -- known as anthropogenic pressure. The study also establishes that the region has lost large tracts of deciduous cover in Kanakapura and Anekal taluks due to intensified horticulture activities and deforestation.
 	
 	  	Environmentalist AN Yellappa Reddy said, “This is a serious issue and if the report is compiled and submitted, the forest department should take it seriously and act accordingly. The forest belongs to the forest department, but for a long time now, they have failed to protect their interests and the government is more concerned about human development than conserving wildlife.”
 	
 	  	The greens are of the view that the study is going to have a serious impact on the way the state government has demarcated the Eco Sensitive Zones (ESZ) around the BNP. A recent draft, sent to the central government for approval, sees the ESZ arbitrarily marked ranging from 100 meters to two kilomteres from the BNP boundary, depending on the extent of urban sprawl at different places.
 	
 	  	BNP Deputy Conservator of Forests Sunil Panwar said that he has still not received an official report, but is aware that the IISc has been carrying out a study on the BNP ESZ to assess the environmental impact of human interference in the region. “Once I get the official version of the report, I will analyse it and take up the matter with the higher authorities,” he added.
 	
 	
 	
 	 		WHY BNP NEEDS TO BE CONSERVED
 		
 		
 		

 		 			* Unique region of biological and ecological importance and is irreplaceable if destroyed
 			
 			 		 			* It is the prime habitat for several species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds including the endangered Asian Elephant
 			
 			 		 			* BNP serves as a terminal point on the northern side of the Mysore Elephant Reserve. It is the movement path for Asian Elephants that migrate from the adjacent Cauvery wildlife Sanctuary of Karnataka and Krishnagiri and Hosur Forest Division of Tamil Nadu.
 			
 			 		 			* Crucial watershed for streams and rivers Arkavathi, Suvarnamukhi, Muthyalamadavu hole, Rayathmala hole, Hebbalahalla and Antharagange, which joins Cauvery River and recharges it.
 			
 			
 			
 			
 			
 			
 			
 			 				SPECIES UNDER THREAT
 				
 				

 				 					Asian elephants, Indian gaur, Sambar deer, spotted deer, Leopard Wild dog, Wild pig, Sloth bear, Common mongoose, Pangolin, Slender loris and Black naped hare. 			 		 		

 	 
 
 
 NEED FOR ESZ
 
 
 	* ESZs are ecologically and economically vital, but also vulnerable to even mild disturbances and hence demand conservation.
 	
 	  	* Protection of animal movement paths would help in mitigating human-animal conflicts and also minimise the instances of wild fauna straying into nearby urban areas (Bengaluru)
 	
 	  	* Degradation of ESZs due to anthropogenic activities could cause irreversible changes in the structure of biological communities at BNP.
 	  	
 	* To reduce biotic pressures on the habitat due to increasing number of humans
 	
 	  	* It plays an important role in the conservation of wildlife and its management
