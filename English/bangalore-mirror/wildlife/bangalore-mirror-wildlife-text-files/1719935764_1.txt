NTCA recommends measures to notch up protection efforts in Anshi-Dandeli
 
 
 	Is your state doing enough to conserve big cats? If a report by the National Tiger Conservatory Authority (NTCA) is anything to go by, the answer is a big ‘no’. Reviewing the conservation work at the Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserve, NTCA officials have slammed the government over ‘poor status of protection’ of big cats at the reserve. Further, the apex body in India that overlooks the conservation and protection of tigers across the country, has recommended a slew of measures.
 	  	Following various reports and complaints by the activists, NTCA officials attached with the regional centre in Bengaluru visited the reserve last year in August-September. They made a detailed submission to the NTCA. Following the observations, the nodal agency in February 2015, has recommended various measures to promote conservation activities. The former assistant inspector general of forests, NTCA, regional centre, Shiva-kumar CM, had observed that many of the anti-poaching camps lacked required manp-ower and were functioning in a makeshift building. Furt-her, the untimely and delayed payment of wages to personnel was also brought to the notice of the inspecting officials.
 	  	Shivkumar in his report said, “While the NTCA guideline says that every APC must have five watchers, all except one had only four.” Sources in the department revealed that the shortage of manpower came in the way of protection as it was difficult to man tough terrains within forests.
 	  	Listing out various observations, the report says, “The attendance of watchers and their protection work was hardly monitored by the local officials. Besides, the officials had not convened the executive committee of the Tiger Conservation Foundation for the last two years. This apart, the funds available with the foundation were spent without the consent of the executive committee.” The inspecting officials also noted that ‘overall team spirit among the staffers was lacking in protection and management of tiger reserve’. The officials also recommended resolving of salary problems of watchers by issuing clear-cut guidelines on fund management and filling up of vacancies on a priority basis.
 	  	Commenting on the inspection report, Vinay Luthra, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) said, “It was true that AIG of the NTCA, regional centre, had inspected and submitted a report. But many of the findings were not factual as most of the inspected areas were out of the tiger reserve limits. Subsequently, the IG, NTCA had also inspected works within and reported that this was happening as per recommendations. In some cases, there has been delay in executing the work or payment to staff. But by and large, the department has put in enough efforts to bring about a huge change and anybody can visit the reserve to find out the situation of conservational work.”
 	  	The Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserve was notified by the Centre in 2007, joining the Anshi National Park and Dan-deli Wildlife Sanctuary spread across 340 square km. Out of all the tiger reserves in the state, Dandeli is the youngest reserve with a tiger population of five to six tigers per 100 sq km. In fact, the recent census on tigers had noted that the Dandeli-Anshi reserve has enough potential and space to accommodate a larger population of the big cats.
