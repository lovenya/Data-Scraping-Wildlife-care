After about 50 hours of rescue operations, two missing trekkers (Vivek Gupta and Shashidhar Shivakumar) were finally rescued on Tuesday evening. Chikmagaluru SP Santhosh Babu told Mirror, “We finally found the trekkers who were in a frail state.
 
 We brought them back to Baba Budangiri and they are safe now.” Sources said the two trekkers were found when they were roaming near Tanige Bail in Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. Tanige Bail is around 50 kilometres inside the forest near Baba Budangiri. Officials said that these two trekkers probably lost their way and continued to hunt for a new path and ended up going in an unknown territory.
 
 	Meanwhile, it was a tense moment for the family of Shashidhar Shivakumar ever since they got the news. Speaking to Mirror from Hyderabad, Sai Sagar, Shivkumar’s younger brother said, “On Sunday midnight, there were many calls to my dad’s mobile and we noticed them only on Monday. When we called back, we were shocked to learn that my older brother was missing.”
 	  	On Tuesday night, though, Sai received another call. “The person speaking over the phone was none other than Shashidhar. He said that he was safe and was with forest officials. Thanks to everyone's prayers, my brother is safe.”
