Virajpet Division Deputy Conservator of Forest H C Kantharaju, who is in-charge of Madikeri division, said, “Stationing a veterinarian at the Elephant Camp or in Kodagu district headquarters could have saved these animals. There is no medical help around when an elephant falls sick. I have written to the government through PCCF (wildlife) seeking appointment of a doctor just for Kodagu district.” There is only one veterinarian Dr G L Srinivas for five forest circles — Madikeri, Virajpet, Bandipur, Hunsur and Kushalnagar — spread over 500 square kilometres. He has the elephantine task of covering these five circles without any vehicle to reach an injured elephant easily. Srinivas is attached to Nagarhole division and stationed in Mysore. He is only on deputation to the five circles.  FATAL ATTACKS
Attacks by wild elephants on captive elephants around the camp area are the main reason behind the deaths of these elephants, according to  Conservator of Forest (Project Elephant) Ajay Mishra.

Nine people killed in elephant attacks
It is not just elephants that are dying. In the past two months, 9 people have lost their lives due to attacks by wild elephants in the state. Four people have died in Kodagu district, two each in Hassan and Ramanagaram districts and one person in Hunsur division. Each family of the deceased has been given a compensation of Rs 1.50 lakh.

Slow death for jumbos
Bullets lodged in the bodies of elephants in Kodagu district are causing their slow death. Many people in Kodagu have licensed guns and fire at elephants to safeguard their estates. According to Virajpet Division Deputy Conservator of Forest H C Kantharaju, normal double barrel bullets hardly harm pachyderms. To cause more damage to the animal, people fill these bullets with ball bearings and other shrapnel. These tampered bullets enter deep inside the elephant’s body and kill it slowly.
