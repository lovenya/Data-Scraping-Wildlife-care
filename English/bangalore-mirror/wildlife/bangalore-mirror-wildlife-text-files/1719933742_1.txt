Narcotics aren’t the only contraband items whose price shoots up exponentially in the international market. Snake venom is also proving to be a lucrative business for wildlife poachers and smugglers.

On Saturday, the Udupi police busted a four-member gang involved in the snake venom trade. The gang had succeeded in extracting a litre of venom from snakes that have their habitat in the Western Ghats. A litre of snake venom fetches around Rs 1 crore in the international market.

The seizure has left both law enforcement agencies and wildlife activists shocked. “This is the first time that we have managed to seize such a huge quantity of snake venom. It is a pointer to the magnitude of venom trading that happens in the coastal belt,” a police officer told Bangalore Mirror.

A team led by Udupi town police inspector Ganesh M Hegde, acting on a tip-off, swooped down on the Adi Udupi market area around 4:30 pm and arrested Nizamuddin (38) of Hubli, Ravindra (45) of Sirsi and Prabhakar (40) of Sagar, and seized the venom bottle. They were scouting for a buyer when they were nabbed. The leader of the gang, Manmath from Sagar, managed to escape.

There is a big market for snake venom, locally as well as in West Asia and South-east Asia. The venom is used by the pharmaceutical industry to make anti-venom serum, the only cure for snake bites, and for other medicines as it has several useful enzymes. Venom can be extracted up to 12 times from a snake, the quantity varying according to the kind of snake. Cobra venom is particularly expensive.

The police plan to send the seized venom to Chennai for laboratory tests.
