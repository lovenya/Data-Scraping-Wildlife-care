In a tragic incident, four elephants were electrocuted after they came in contact with high-tension power lines at Ammathi Vontiangadi village of Virajpet taluk in Kodagu district on Tuesday. Of the four electrocuted, two are adult wild elephants and other two are one to two years old. They came in contact with transmission lines when the wild animals came in search of food, according to forest officials. Power line is learnt to have snapped following heavy rainfall in the district for the last two days.
 
 Since electricity line was connected to the pump house, snapping of the line was not noticed as nobody has visited the spot following heavy rainfall.
 
 This is the second such incident in the last 12 days; two elephants met with similar fate in the district, taking the death toll to six in one month. Every day, about 30 to 35 electric lines are said to have snapped during monsoon. Sometimes, snappiing of high-tension power cables passing through the forest and coffee estates went unnoticed, leading to such tragic incidents. Short-circuits are a major problem in this area due to heavy rainfall, coupled with winds.
 
 Deputy conservative of forests Maria Christu Raja told BM the elephants might have been killed on Monday night or Tuesday morning. The forest department has now appealed to power department to restore the lines. The department is planning to set up a high-level committee with the MD of Electricity Corporation to come up with a strategy to avert such incidents. Open transmission lines pose huge risk to wildlife. Hence, they need to have insulated cable lines to mitigate such incidents to some extent.
