“As I reflect on 2018, something about this image has a metaphorical quality for Mumbai and everything she stands for. What makes this city so special to me is that her growth and development seem to be just as frantic and chaotic as her resistance to change. The image was made as 2018 is drawing to a close — it was made on Christmas, on Chapel Road, Bandra — but it may very well have been made in 1960.”

“This was shot in the Transhimalayan part of J&K. This is a border scratched upon land by man, painted in blood, policed in lead and iron. Birds and well, this Equus kiang, cleary do not recognise borders.”

“For me, 2018 has been all about prepping for my film — what the press have titled Ballet Boys. I took this photo when we were on a recce checking out locations. It’s very much what my film is about — local kids with loads of talent waiting to be discovered.”

“This picture from my Atrocities against Dalits in India series shows Meghabai Sondharva, who continues her husband Nanjibhai’s fight. Nanjibhai, from Manekwada village, Gujarat, had taken on the so-called ‘upper caste’ Darbars, when he filed an RTI application demanding transparency in the functioning of the Gram Panchayat. On Diwali, in 2016, some-70 Darbars broke into his home, hacked his father’s shoulder with a sword and sexually harassed his wife. Months later, in another planned attack, Nanjibhai was clubbed to death with iron pipes.”

“I was in Assam’s Kaziranga National Park in February this year, mentoring the participants of a magazine’s photography contest. We were exploring the park’s various zones, looking for rhinoceros and other species. During one of the evenings, I spotted this mother and baby [Indian rhinoceros, also called greater one-horned rhinoceros) from a distance in the central zone. I waited for them to come closer as I wanted to capture the pink flowers and misty background. They were grazing, and really took their time, but, ultimately, it was worth the wait. I find it usually is.”

“ Whenever I can, I set out to shoot portraits of people I find interesting. I shot this in January, in Juhu. The gentleman in the picture — Captain Suresh Rajani — is the father of a friend of mine. He’ll be 71 next year. I really admire his spirit. He runs a company which services warships and naval vessels, and travels the world, meeting, along the way, lots of commanders and officers. That’s why he got this idea of putting badges on. Some were gifted to him, others he’s bought. He has a tailor make new outfits for him every two weeks. I wanted to capture his zeal for life. This is just a basic portrait, but I feel it says so much about him.”

“I love experimenting with slow shutter speed, and different lighting techniques. This image — shot for an Indian fashion brand’s campaign this year — I feel, has a ‘haunting’ quality. It was shot just last month in an empty warehouse. Many brands don’t give photographers the latitude to let their creativity really flow. A few have started coming around now, and it’s great. I also love this abstract/fine art image because it’s so pure, and old-school: it wasn’t photoshopped at all.”
