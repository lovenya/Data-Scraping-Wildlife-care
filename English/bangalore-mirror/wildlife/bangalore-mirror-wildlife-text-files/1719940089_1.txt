Authorities were racing to douse a massive fire that broke out at BRT Tiger Reserve, on Monday evening. An official from the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) confirmed the news of the fire and informed that it engulfed 30 hectares of forest area in a short period.

“The fire was man-made and was probably started by disgruntled villagers at three different spots in the tiger reserve. It was set on Monday afternoon and by evening, over 30 hectares of forest area was gutted,” said the official.

However, wildlife conservationists on-ground say the damaged area could be much more than 30 hectares.

“While the official number is 30 hectares, in all probability, it is much higher. It also appears that it is in five areas of the Punanjur range of BRT. Since multiple places were set on fire, the task has become more onerous for forest staff to douse the raging flames.

There is a shortage of quick response vehicles owing to the Government of India’s directive to condemn vehicles that are 15 years old, which has constrained the fire services department from assisting on-ground forest staff. Otherwise, some parts of the tiger habitat could have been saved,” said Joseph Hoover, former State Board for Wildlife member and founder of the United Conservation Movement and Charitable Trust.
 
According to KFD officials, out of the three spots, fires at two spots were successfully doused by 7 pm and authorities are trying to put out a fire from the third area.
There are firefighters on the ground and all efforts are being made to douse the fire.
 
The department has brought in fire watchers in good strength to manage the situation. There is not much to be worried about. It will be under control soon,” said the KFD official.
