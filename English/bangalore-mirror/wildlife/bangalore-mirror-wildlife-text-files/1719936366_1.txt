Vedansh — a 6th standard student — is already an ace photographer and has been spreading the message of wildlife conservation
 
 
 	He is yet to step intohis teens. But evidently, he is a Steve Winter-in-making. Meet 12-year-old Vedansh Pandey –a 6th grade student of NPS, Koramangala – who made his Kabini trip last week a memorable photo journey. 
 	
 	  	With his gears – a Canon EOS 6D and two lenses 70-200mm and 10-400mm – Vedansh managed to capture candid wildlife against the backdrop of Kabini waters. 
 	
 	  	He stepped into the world of photography by his father at a very early age. Now Vedansh is a frequent traveller to several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries of the state and has been spreading message of wildlife conservation.
