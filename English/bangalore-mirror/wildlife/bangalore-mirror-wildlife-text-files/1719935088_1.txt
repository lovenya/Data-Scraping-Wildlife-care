In a decision that has ruffled the feathers of wildlife enthusiasts and is in complete contradiction to its stand barely two years ago, the forest department has issued an order permitting Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) officials to shoot and kill birds coming in the path of flights. 

 Prior to granting permission, forest department authorities say they had carried out a ground study and found various species like black kites, Brahminy kites, hawks, cattle egrets, pond heron, little egrets and smaller birds like larks and wagtails in the area. Some of these are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. 

 	The reason being cited is critical aspects involved in flight operations, which include flights of VVIPs, especially top central government officials and foreign dignitaries. However, in April 2012, the forest department had come down heavily on senior HAL officials and even booked criminal cases when they gunned down birds coming in the path of flights at the old airport owned by HAL. 

 	Why the flip-flop just 19 months after Wing Commander (retired) M P Srinivas, the airport’s air traffic controller, was booked under various sections of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is a question they are at a loss to answer. 

 	Wildlife enthusiasts say the order dated July 20 which grants ‘limited bird shooting’ exposes the double standards of the forest department. “Permission is hereby granted to carry out limited bird shooting inside the HAL airport in the interest of flight safety. The permission is valid only within the perimeter of the HAL airport premises where the runways for aircraft landing and take-off are located. The permission is issued in the interest of protecting the lives of the passengers and pilots as well as the aircraft,” G S Prabhu, the principal chief conservator of forests, has stated in his order. 

 	The forest department order refers to a requisition by HAL citing concern over the safety of crew/passengers during take-off and landing due to the presence of a large number of birds in the vicinity. HAL further makes a case for such measures citing unique flying activities undertaken at the airport including test-flying, flying of new aircraft after manufacture, repair and overhaul, flying of prototype aircraft and flying by the armed forces. Referring to the requisition (for permission to shoot) made by the HAL general manager in March 2013, who had stated that to prevent loss of life and damage in crores of rupees in the event of an accident due to obstacles on the runways, it was imperative to carry out limited shooting of birds, the PCCF stated it had granted the same. 

 	What gives the issue another twist is that a panel has recently been set up to study more viable approaches to the problem. Former chief wildlife warden and present PCCF (principal chief conservator of forests) and head of forest force Dipak Sarmah set up the committee in May, which included squadron leader Mahesh Kumar, an expert panel member of DGCA, and the national bird control committee, to suggest humane solutions to the bird-hit problem to over 25 airports across India.The July 20 permission to shoot has been granted even before the committee submits its solutions. 

 	“This is a strange order and we will be taking it up with the principal secretary,” a wildlife enthusiast told Bangalore Mirror. 
 	
 	‘NO CONTRADICTION’
 	“This (new order granting permission) does not contradict our previous one at all and it (permission for limited shooting) is well within the provisions of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act,” G S Prabhu, PCCF (wildlife) told Bangalore Mirror. When asked about the previous instance of booking a case against a HAL official in a similar situation, he maintained, “A case was booked in the past because they had not taken prior approval. Now, they have sought permission and it has been given as per the Act. They haven’t killed a single bird so far and they are conservative. It will be done as a last resort.”
 	
 	Go for humane solutions: Expert
 	“Shooting is uncalled for,” renowned ornithologist Mohammed Dilawar told Bangalore Mirror, stressing non-invasive methods should be the first option to check the bird menace. He suggests a range of such approaches to keep the birds at bay.
 	
 	“When it comes to bird mitigation, there are mainly two procedures and both are non-invasive. The first one is using noise-guns to chase the birds away; crackers and drums can also be used. This is the first line of defence. The second and more important one is studying the migration pattern and movement of birds which occurs in a cyclical manner and can offer a solution to the problem,” says Dilawar, adding that flight schedules can be altered after tracking regular movement patterns of the winged ones.
 	
 He says shooting should be resorted to only in emergencies such as when a fighter plane needs to land and a bird is obstructing its path.
