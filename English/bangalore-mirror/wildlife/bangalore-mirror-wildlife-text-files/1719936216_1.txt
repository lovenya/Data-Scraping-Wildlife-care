Two female Bonnet macaques that were rescued after they were found injured but kept as pets for more than three years were confiscated from Chandapura village by People for Animals (PFA), Bengaluru on Saturday.
 
 	PFA rescuers Somu and Harish, aided by volunteers Rajesh and Kaushik, carried out the rescue operation that lasted close to eight hours owing to threats by some residents of Chandapura.
 	
 	  	Of the eventful operation, Somu told Bangalore Mirror, “Some members of the house we traced the macaques in told us that they had found the Bonnet macaques injured on the roadside three years ago. They claim to have provided for their treatment and kept them as pets for over three years. They did not know one is not supposed to keep these animals at home.”
 	
 	  	On reaching the spot, the PFA rescuers met with opposition from not only members of the family that had chained the monkeys at their waist, but also other villagers. This prompted them to seek legal help, but by the time police arrived at the village, the monkeys were missing.
 	
 	  	“The villagers had handed over the monkeys to forest officials when we went to fetch the police. The forest officials passed on the monkeys to us,” added Harish. The macaques were shifted to PFA’s Wildlife Hospital at Kengeri.
