No one may be able to explain the idiom ‘bite the hand that feeds’ better than US citizen Wallace Weatherholt. An alligator bit off his hand last month when he allegedly tried to feed it. And last week, he was arrested on charges of illegally feeding the 'gator.  
   The 63-year-old Florida tour boat captain was charged with unlawful feeding of an alligator, a second-degree misdemeanor, and was later released on a $1,000 bond, according to Collier County records.    His next court date is August 22.   When he was attacked on June 12, Weatherholt had been giving a tour of the Everglades to an Indiana family. After the attack, Florida Fish and Wildlife officials launched a criminal investigation, and determined he was trying to feed the reptile.   The touring family said Weatherholt hung a fish over the side of the boat, with his hand at the water's surface, when the alligator attacked. Alligators have a natural fear of humans and if they are fed by people, they lose that fear, David Weathers, an alligator trapper and owner of several alligators, told the Fort Myers News-Press.   The attacking alligator was later killed and Weatherholt's hand was retrieved, but doctors were unable to reattach it.
