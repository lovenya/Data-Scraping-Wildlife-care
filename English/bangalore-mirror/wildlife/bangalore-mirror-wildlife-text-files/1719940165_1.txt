Think twice before dumping garbage in the forest as officials may come knocking at your door. In a recent incident, the forest officials tailed an individual who had thrown trash at Turahalli. Not just that, he was made to visit Turahalli forest, clean the trash and also write an apology letter stating that he won’t repeat the act. Forest officials said that these incidents shed light on the growing problem of littering not only in city streets but also in forests near urban areas, which have become dumping grounds due to rapid urbanisation.

Turahalli is a 590-acre forest which is one of the last surviving forests within Bengaluru; the city is growing so fast that a few of the forest areas are now part of the urban zone.
 
N Ravindra Kumar, deputy conservator of forests (Bengaluru Urban) told Bangalore Mirror, ”We have been taking a number of measures to protect Turahalli. Recently, a voluntary group cleaned up the Turahalli forest and all the trash was removed. However, the next day, we were surprised to see that trash was dumped again in the forest. While we were wondering how to catch the culprits, we came across a few boxes of e-commerce orders. There was an address written on the boxes. So, we noted down the address and went to the home of the individual who had dumped them. Upon inquiring, he confessed to dumping the trash and regretted his act. We took him to the site and made him clean the place. This was done so that he realises the mistake, how difficult it is to

clear the trash and why he should not repeat it. Later, we made him write an apology too. This is just a warning that we are watchful of people dumping trash here and anyone doing so in the future will face similar consequences.” This incident reminds us that authorities and volunteers are not satisfied with just the penalty. Recently, a few individuals in Kushalnagar (Kodagu) had seen wedding cards being thrown by a Bengaluru family at Cauvery river. The individuals called up the Bengaluru family and ensured that they travel back from the capital and collect all the wedding cards that were thrown away and clean up the place.

Kumar added, “Littering is strictly prohibited and considered an offence. Unfortunately, many travellers have been observed discarding their trash along the Turahalli roadside and even within the forest area, often in plastic covers. This widespread littering has become a significant challenge to address, as it is difficult to apprehend those responsible for these actions.”
 
Officials stressed that despite ongoing cleaning initiatives, forests are quickly becoming littered, posing a significant environmental challenge: The transformation of these natural spaces into trash bins is alarming and calls for immediate attention and action. It is essential for individuals to be responsible and mindful of their waste disposal practices, especially in sensitive ecological areas like forests. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of environmental conservation and the need for collective efforts to preserve our natural surroundings. Authorities and communities must work together to promote awareness about responsible waste management and the preservation of natural habitats.

Sandeep K, a wildlife activist said, “The forest department has several options at its disposal to tackle the issue of trashing forest land. One of the primary strategies is to enhance surveillance across forest areas. This can be achieved by deploying modern technology such as cameras and drones to monitor vulnerable spots prone to littering. By keeping a close watch on these areas, the department can identify and deter individuals engaging in illegal dumping activities. 

Alongside surveillance, awareness campaigns play a crucial role in preventing littering. The forest department can launch educational initiatives targeting tourists, hikers, and local communities. These campaigns should highlight the importance of maintaining cleanliness in forest areas and the environmental impact of littering. By educating people about responsible waste disposal practices, the department can instil a sense of responsibility and ownership among visitors. Regular clean-up drives are essential to maintain cleanliness in forest areas. The forest department can organise clean-up initiatives with the help of volunteers, forest staff, and local communities.

This is just a warning that we are watchful of people dumping trash here; anyone doing so in the future will face similar consequences…— N Ravindra Kumar, deputy conservator of forests (Bengaluru Urban) 

These efforts not only remove existing litter but also create awareness about the importance of preserving the natural beauty of forested regions. Promoting eco-friendly practices among visitors is another key strategy. Encouraging the use of reusable items such as water bottles and bags, minimising packaging waste, and advocating a ‘pack-in, pack-out’ policy can significantly reduce littering incidents.”
