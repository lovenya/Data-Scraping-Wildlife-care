In 1973, ‘Gandhada Gudi’ the first Indian film on forest conservation ever, was released. Starring the legendary Dr. Raj Kumar, the film inspired generations to care for forests and to safeguard them. It was one of the earliest examples of the power of cinema to inspire people to make change.

Now, nearly after five decades, it is time for us to remember the legacy and to celebrate our ‘Gandhada Gudi’, our sacred temple. In a dream project envisioned by Puneeth Rajkumar with Amoghavarsha, the documentary features Puneeth and Amoghavarsha exploring the wildlife and nature. While the rich visual imagery and storytelling of the film is first of its kind, the audience will get a chance to see Puneeth Rajkumar just as himself, a son of the soil.

The film creates a new category of cinema that is best enjoyed on the big screen. PRK Productions and Mudskipper have left no stone unturned in using the latest in technology along with the best talent from across the world. The music by Ajaneesh Loknath uses a unique multi genre treatment and songs that stir up emotions.

 Appu’s dream, an incredible story, a celebration of our land and it’s a legend. It’s time for the return - “Gandhada Gudi” in a full length feature format. Gandhada Gudi is currently in post-production phase and is slated to be a much awaited release of 2022.
