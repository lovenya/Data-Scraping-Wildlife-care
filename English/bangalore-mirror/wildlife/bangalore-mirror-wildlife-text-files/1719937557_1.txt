Last week, in a colony in Attibele, Devansh Diwakar, a class 11 student of Delhi Public School (East) noticed a bird lying still in the park. The bird looked injured and seemed to be starving. “My intention was to save it. Even if it pecked me or something, it would be doing so out of fear, so I wasn’t scared to approach it,” he recounts.

Devansh carried this bird home and tried to treat it without much result. “I searched all over the internet and I did not get a clue and the only thing I knew was that it was a nocturnal bird and it is rarely seen,” he says. It would not move. I tried feeding it some insects. It wouldn’t feed on them. I wanted to do something and was at a loss. So, I wrote a mail to Maneka Gandhi,” he explains. 

“I knew she was the one who was instrumental in bringing the Wildlife Protection bill. I got an immediate response and Maneka Gandhi said that she would help me. She shared contact numbers of NGOs she knew,” says Devansh. Maneka shared contact details of People for Animals who put Devansh in touch with Avian and Reptile Rehabilitation Centre (ARRC).

“When I called the ARRC and told them the details, they identified the bird as a Nightjar, a rare species. They came from Banaswadi the same day and took the bird for treatment,” says Devansh. Until the bird rescuers came to his house, Maneka Gandhi was in touch with Devansh.

This animal lover had his first pet, a goldfish, at the age of six. “Since then, I’ve kept birds, guinea pigs and fish. I love animals and I try to do something when I notice that they need help.” Manila Carvalho, principal of DPS (East) says of Devansh, “In a world chiefly governed by materialistic success, Devansh stands tall with this human activity,” says Carvalho.
