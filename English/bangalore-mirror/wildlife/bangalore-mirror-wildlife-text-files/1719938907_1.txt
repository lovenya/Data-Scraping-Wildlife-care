A police inspector’s decision to not support a stray dog feeder, when his neighbours ganged up against him, has landed the cop in trouble. A few animal activists lodged a complaint with the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Southeast division, against the police inspector.

Fifty-year-old Praveen (name changed), an IT consultant and a wildlife rescuer, is a resident of an apartment in Electronic City Phase 2 since 2016 and has been feeding stray dogs for a long time. A few residents of his apartment alleged that one of the dogs he feeds had bit two residents and asked him to stop feeding them. But, Praveen continued feeding.

On Sunday, when Praveen and his wife weren’t home, around 10-12 people gathered outside their flat. Meanwhile, their 11-year-old daughter was alone inside the flat. “They started knocking on the door loudly, forcefully opened the windows and even started filming my daughter crying. When she informed me, I was around 15-20 minutes away from home,” Praveen said.

He called up the police control room and informed the cops. By the time the police arrived, the group had left the house. Later, Praveen was summoned to the Hebbagodi police station as a few of his neighbours had filed a complaint against him for feeding stray dogs.

Praveen said, at the station, the police inspector was not ready to listen to his statement. The inspector allegedly threatened him, a few other activists who had gone to the station with him, stating that if another dog bite incident is reported from the residents of the apartment, the police would take a written complaint from the residents and file a case on Praveen and the animal activist. 

When the activists argued, the officer allegedly addressed them disrespectfully. As the police had summoned Praveen without a non-cognizable complaint, SPCA member KB Harish along with Praveen filed an e-mail complaint to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Southeast division.
