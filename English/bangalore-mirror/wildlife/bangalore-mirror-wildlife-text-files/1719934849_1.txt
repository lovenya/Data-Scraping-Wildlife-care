  How many budding photographers have you roped in and who are they? There are 25 budding photographers, (most of them students) and belong to a group called Thank God It Is Saturday (TGIS).     That sounds more like a bar that one would visit on a weekend... TGIS is a group that meets on Saturdays to learn, experiment and enjoy photography as an art. It has experienced and novice photographers. We had invited submissions; a selection committee, including Anand Sharan, renowned photographer, chose around fifty photos, which will be displayed at the show. The entire collection was put together in four months.      Any theme in particular? The photographs will be a visual treat that celebrates nature, people, flora, fauna, abstracts, landscapes and wildlife. But to sum up the theme, I can say that each and every photograph here will look good in a modern home. All the photographs have been created using archival printing.      The idea behind this exhibition is to raise funds for a cause. Tell us about the cause. I have been associated with the% Multiple Sclerosis Society of India for a long time. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one of the least discussed diseases. It affects people particularly women between 20 to 40 years of age. What most don't ealise is that MS is preceded by optical neuritis (temporary blindness) and that is the time when further investigations need to be done, like MRI scan and so on to catch it early. Instead, eye drops are given. MS then returns with greater intensity. The show is mainly to raise funds for patients, rural in particular, who can't afford treatment. And in the process, I hope to spread awareness for this crippling disease.
