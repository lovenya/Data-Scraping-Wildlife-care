He is a Biotechnology professor by profession. But Dr H Ramakrishnaiah’s passion for his hobby gave him international fame. He has been awarded the prestigious AFIAP by Federation Internationale de la' art photographique, France—world's official photographic body affiliated to UNESCO. 

 	Ramakrishnaiah is awarded for clicking exceptional artistic photos in terms of originality, style and outstanding technique. 

 	Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Ramakrishnaiah admitted that he has been pursuing photography for years. “Whenever I get time, I go to the outskirts of Bangalore and Mysore,” he said. For him, patience is the key challenge to get the right shot. “I had to take at least eight to 10 days to get the right background, composition and light. There have been days that even after getting a relatively better picture I rejected it. I wanted to capture the best shot.” 

 	Ramakrishnaiah has clicked around one lakh photographs so far. AFIAP is not the first international recognition for him. He had bagged the prestigious fellowship from Royal Photographic Society, London. He won 15 gold medals in international exhibitions. He thinks getting a nomination into the finals of the BBC wildlife photographer of the year and winning a Nature Biannual Gold Medal in Norway in 2011 are his personal best achievements so far. Ramakrishnaiah’s interest in wildlife photography developed five years ago. 

 	His advice to the budding photographers is very simple. “Take as many as pictures you can. One can learn by taking as many photos as possible and become a good photographer,” he said.
