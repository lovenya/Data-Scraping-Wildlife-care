The Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) is all set to become a trekking hotspot for the IT city’s hikers as authorities have decided to dedicate unoccupied forest patches within their premises to nature awareness activities including trekking and bird watching activities.  
 Executive director of BBP, Dr R Raju, told Bangalore Mirror, “Previously we had a master plan which concentrated only on the development of zoo and safari. As a result several unoccupied forest patches were left out. Since the Central Zoo Authority board rejected the plan on technical grounds, we are formulating a new plan including all these educational activities.”  
 The new master plan is likely to include guided trekking activities, photography workshops, bird watching exercises and nature familiarising programmes for school children.   
 Located 22 kms away from the IT City, BBP is spread over 733.00 hectares area amidst thick dry deciduous forest of Bannerghatta National Park. Currently the park has only four wings including zoo, rescue centre, butterfly park and safari enclosures. Apart from these locations, several other spots are still virgin forest. Now the BBP officials have decided to conduct guided educational and nature awareness programmes for the wildlife enthusiasts.  
 The BBP comprising all the four units has a total of 1,389 animals belonging to 75 species. Among them 430 birds of 30 species, 200 reptiles of 14 species, 759 mammals of 31 species and 55 animals in the rescue centre.
