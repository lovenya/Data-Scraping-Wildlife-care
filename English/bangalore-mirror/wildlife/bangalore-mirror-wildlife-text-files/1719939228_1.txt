Water quality checks of the three city lakes, Kothanur, Chunchaghatta, and Doddakalsandra, from January to June, 2022, revealed that they were falling under the ‘class D’ category - fine for propagation of wildlife and fisheries, but not for human use. Lake activists want the BBMP to wake up and look into reviving the lakes.

A recent report published by ActionAid showed that there were 32 fish deaths in different lakes in the city this year. The high number is a cause of worry for the city’s water bodies.

The Central Pollution Control Board says that the standard coliform intake should be 5,000 MPN/100ml.

KSPCB data showed that Kothanur Lake reported the highest coliform levels in January at 92,000 MPN/100 ml, followed by 24,000 MPN/100 ml in February, 1,600 MPN/100ml in March, and 35,000 MPN/100 ml in April. It climbed to 92,000 MPN/100 ml in May, and June saw a decline at 9,200 MPN/100 ml.
 
Similarly, the recently rejuvenated Doddakalsandra Lake at Konanakunte reported high coliform content during the same period from 5,400 MPN/100 ml – 1,60,000 MPN/100 ml. Chunchaghatta lake in JP Nagar was no different with figures between 9,200-92,000 MPN/100ml. Raghavendra B Pachhapur, Lake activist and Programme Manager at ActionAid Association, said, “Total Coliform includes fecal coliform, a bacteria found in human and animal waste. The excess sewage in the lake will contain nitrate and phosphates that can lead to eutrophication. Eutrophication is the process in which a water body becomes overly enriched with nutrients, leading to plentiful growth of simple plant life. This will lead to reduced oxygen supply to the lake, which can be harmful for fish.”


  On the lakefrontWhile lake activists, environmentalists and researchers, on numerous occasions in the past, have highlighted various industrial areas in the city violating the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) policy of the government and discharging effluents into the waterbodies, KSPCB has a different story.

Statistics from the three lakes showed that dissolved oxygen (DO) content in the lake did not fare well. DO is one of the most important indicators of water quality. It is essential for the survival of fish and other aquatic organisms. Six months of data show that the DO levels have been between 3.2-6 at Kothanur ake. Doddakallasandra Lake reported between 4.8-6, and Chunchaghatta Lake between 4.0-6.

According to KSPCB, the dissolved oxygen content at 6 is of ‘A class’, which qualifies as drinking water. Anything that reduces to 4 and below goes to class D and E, that is unfit for consumption.
 
“BBMP should act against higher levels of BOD and lower levels of DO. While the KSPCB has carried out water quality analysis of only 105 lakes, we need to ensure all rejuvenated lakes of Bengaluru are covered under water quality analysis,” said Raghavendra.

Citizens also added that the three departments BBMP, KSPC,B and BWSSB should work together in order to ensure better health of lakes.
