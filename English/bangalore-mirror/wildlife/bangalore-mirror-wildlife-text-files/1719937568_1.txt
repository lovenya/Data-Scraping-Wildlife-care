Chennai: A court in Tamil Naduâ€™s Erode district on Tuesday acquitted all the nine surviving accused charged in the infamous abduction of Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar by forest brigand Veerappan in the year 2000.

A district court judge in Gopichettipalayam, K.Mani delivered the verdict in favour of the accused on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, sources said.

A total of 14 people including forest brigand Veerappan and his associates were charged in the case. While four people including Veerappan were killed in an encounter by the Special Task Force in 2004, one Ramesh has been absconding. The others namely, Govindaraj, Andril, Pasuvanna, Puttusamy, Kalmandiraman, Maran, Selvam, Amrithalingam and Nagaraj faced trial.

Rajkumar and three others including his son-in-law were abducted when Veerappan and his men struck at the actor's farmhouse at Gajanur, a village in Thalavady taluk of Erode district, on the night of July 30, 2000. Veerappan, however, spared the actor's wife Parvathamma through whom he sent a cassette to be delivered to Karnataka chief minister seeking to send an emissary to meet him. Veerappan later came out with a slew of demands for releasing the actor.

Rajkumar was released after 108 days in captivity on September 14. The Gajanur village abutting the Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary is the birthplace of Rajkumar. It is 4 km from Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border.

The abduction of the actor worsened the already strained relationship between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 

Rajkumar died of cardiac arrest in 2006.
