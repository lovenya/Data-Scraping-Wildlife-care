Though the boat tragedy has shocked the people of Bangalore, travellers still want to visit Thekkady. Various travel agencies which run buses to Thekkady confirmed this fact. All buses to this exotic locale are booked for the next three days. “We cannot give guarantee the lives of tourists. Our job is to transport them to the destinations safely. The bookings are full”, a representative from Kallada Travels said.

Thekkady is the most favoured honeymoon destination and outing spot of the professionals working in various fields in city. Two-day and four-day trips are organised by various travel agencies at a cost of Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000. Travel agents who organise these tours agree that the tragedy will definitely have an impact and people might think of another destination in the long term, if Kerala government fails to reassure the people about their safety and security.

People are drawn to picturesque Thekkady, located 186 km south east of Kochi. It attracts a whole lot of visitors, because this small village is the only gateway to the most famous Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. This was a place known for elephant poaching. However today, things have changed and the poachers have turned into protectors of animals. Tourists get to interact with the tribals who still stay within the park premises. People visiting Kerala on a holiday make it a point not to miss the sanctuary.

The place is an important plantation centre and conjures up images of elephants, unending chains of hills and spice-scented plantations and attracts a whole lot of visitors.

The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the finest wildlife reserves of India and a magnet for trekkers. It offers you a good chance of seeing the great Indian tiger in its natural habitat.
