THE FAKE

An image of a tiger on the Empire State Building in New York City is being circulated with the caption that makes it seem as if it was a tribute to Avni, whose killing drew widespread criticism recently.

SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH?

This is misleading. While the image is not morphed, the context is wrong. It is from an event held in August 2015 called ‘Projecting Change’ that was organised by the Oceanic Preservation Society and Obscura Digital which drew attention to endangered species of wildlife, including the Royal Bengal Tiger.
