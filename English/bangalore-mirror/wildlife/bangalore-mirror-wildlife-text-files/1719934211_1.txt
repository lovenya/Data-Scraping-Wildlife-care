Former India cricket captain Anil Kumble, popularly known as Jumbo among cricket fans, has been entrusted with the task of securing more funds from the Centre to help protect elephants in Karnataka.
 
 The High Court was informed of this development on Monday by a committee formed by it to look into elephant deaths and man-animal conflict in the State and suggest prevention measures. Kumble is a member of the HC appointed committee and also the vice chairman of the State Board for Wildlife.
 
 The committee told the court that funds provided by the Union government for elephant conservation were not enough. The state government sought Rs 20.5 crore from the centre but was given only Rs 2.3 crore. Disappointed with the meagre amount, the committee has asked Kumble to meet the union minister for environment and forests for more funds.
 
 During the hearing of the public interest litigation by a division bench headed by the Chief Justice, counsel N Ravindranath Kamath pointed out that elephants strayed into human habitats due to lack of food in forests. “Bamboo groves, which are the primary source of food for wild elephants, are becoming extinct,” he said.
 
 The court took note of this and the lack of constructive work by the forest department. “Grow food for elephants. How long does it take to grow bamboo? It grows in a short time,” the bench said. 
 
 The forest department’s counsel sought more time to implement the department’s projects. The court granted the department four weeks’ time to apprise it about the steps taken.
 
 Anil Kumble has suggested that elephant range areas of Hassan, Chickmagalur, Bannerghatta, Rama-nagara and others should be consolidated immediately. The Mysore incident, where wild elephants entered the city, was discussed and a standard operation procedure plan to manage such situations was mooted. Guidelines for ex-gratia to victims of human-animal conflict were also mooted.
