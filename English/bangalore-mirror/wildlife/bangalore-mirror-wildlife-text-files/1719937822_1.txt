His love for animals and wildlife is well-known. He has what can be termed a private zoo at his farm and has adopted animals in zoos all over. What is less known, is actor Darshan’s love for wildlife photography. It is one of his private activities he has so far kept away from publicity. Now, in collaboration with the Karnataka Forest Department, the actor is all set to showcase his wild captures. 

A photo exhibition of framed photographs captured by Darshan will be on exhibition at a hotel in Mysuru from March 1 to March 3. Framed photographs will be available for collectors in the show titled Life On The Wild Side. 

Those who wish to get photographs with Darshan’s autograph will have to pay a premium. Unsigned frames will cost Rs 2,000 while autographed frames will cost Rs 2,500. The proceeds from the exhibition is earmarked for conservation causes promoted by the Forest Department. Darshan’s friend the producer, Sandesh Nagaraj, is providing the venue for the exhibition.
