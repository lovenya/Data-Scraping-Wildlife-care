India’s greenest music festival, Echoes of Earth, is back with its fifth edition in Bengaluru.
 
With inventive stages created from upcycled material to curating eclectic music genres that is known to bring together a new-age listening audience, the festival is set to bring back the essence of conscious lifestyle events that promotes mindfulness, sustainability and an alternate, circular lifestyle.
 
In its fifth edition, Echoes of Earth is bringing together stories of wildlife and nature conservation from the unexplored crevices of India’s diverse ecosystems through its theme ‘Circle of life’.
 
This unique circle hosts a range of positive human impact stories that is empowering and uplifting the planet’s endangered species and landscapes. The circle can be best described as ‘A space that holds room for everyone and one where celebration has no pause’.
 
Converging on the festival’s four upcycled stages are musical acts that are culturally and socially diverse.
 
The much-anticipated final line-up includes the likes of The Yussef Dayes Experience, Dorian Concept, Klangophonics, Vieux Farka Toure to local acts such as Anyasa, Hanumankind, Easy Wanderlings, Many Roots Ensemble etc.
 
Echoes of Earth continues as a festival, continues to introduce its audience to the newer genres and charters the future of a mindful listening audience in the country.
