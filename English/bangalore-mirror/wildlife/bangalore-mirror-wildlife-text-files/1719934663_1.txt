Apropos the report Trekking now comes with another risk: Disciplinary action (Sept 29, BM), the blanket ban on trekking that some educational institutions have imposed is unfortunate to say the least. In an age where there’s too much emphasis on academics, it is imperative that students will feel the need to keep in touch with nature through outdoor activities. Such a ban will dissociate youth from nature and wildlife.  Sidharth Shanon  
   In a country where the culture of adventure sports is not even in its embryonic state, such bans may kill the spirit of adventurism before it is born. Babu T Raghu
