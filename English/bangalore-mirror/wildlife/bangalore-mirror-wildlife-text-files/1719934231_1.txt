The police headquarters has ordered its cadre across the state to prevent the slaughter of camels and cows across the state during Ramzan. They have also been ordered to prevent transportation of camels. 
 
 This is the first time that the state police headquarters has issued such a strict executive order. The circular, signed by ADGP Rupak Kumar Gupta on behalf of state police chief N Achuta Rao, cites a high court direction to prevent abuse and slaughter of camels and was sent to all SPs and wildlife sleuths. 
 
 The order, issued under Karnataka Animal Slaughter (Prevention) Act 1959 and Karnataka Animal Slaughter Rules 1963, also empowers the police across the state to book cases against violators under Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Prevention Act, 1964.
 
 “The police department has issued a strict order, prohibiting usage of camels for entertainment. It has also banned slaughtering of camels this Ramzan,” said Sharath Babu, honorary city wildlife warden. 
 
 Some Rajasthan residents were found using around 90 camels for commercial purposes like entertaining children in Talgatpura and Basavangudi areas. The jurisdictional police have also been asked to make immediate arrangements to send these animals back to their home state.
 
 Meanwhile, the BBMP has directed its health department to take necessary measures to check cow slaughter across the city. Veterinary officials have also been asked to go on surprise visits to places where cattle were slaughtered in the past.
 “We have got directions from the department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services. Slaughter of camel and other cattle is strictly prohibited in the state and the same applies to the city,” said Dr Parviz Ahmed Piran, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry, BBMP. 
 
 “Those found violating these would be booked under various provisions of the law prohibiting animal slaughter.”
