Back-to-back deaths of tigers in the wild since the beginning of this year had furrowed the brows of wildlife lovers across the state. But now they have something to cheer about, with three tiger cubs being born in Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP).
 
 
 
 
 
 On Wednesday, 11-year-old tigress Vismaya gave birth to the cubs and is doing well at the rescue and rehabilitation centre at BBP.
 
 BBP officials told BM that Vismaya, who was born to the late Maasti tiger which had escaped from the clutches of poachers in Nagarahole back in 2002 and relocated to BBP, was paired with another tiger Amar. The skill of Maasti, parent of Vismaya, was such that it could hunt down its prey with just three limbs for over ten years.
 
 Dr Manjunath, veterinarian at BBP, said “The series of births in the park during the last one month is indeed a happy sign for the BBP and animal lovers. After the deaths of a number of big cats in the last few months, we are very happy that BBP has seen 7 new tiger cubs in a span of six to seven months. The newborn cubs are very healthy and we are expecting more additions to the tiger family in the next two months.”
 
 To safeguard their health, the mother and the cubs are being attended to by the personnel and doctors at rehabilitation centres away from the public.
 
 The cubs are likely to be available for public display by the end of the month, officials said.
