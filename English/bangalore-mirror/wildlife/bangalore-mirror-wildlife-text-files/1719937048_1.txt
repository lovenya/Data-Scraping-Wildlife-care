Deployed to monitor animals, sanctuary’s cameras capture these shocking images
 
 Cameras deployed to monitor animal movement helped the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) nab two poachers in the Hanur range of Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, a few days ago. While one photograph revealed a gun-wielding man, another caught two poachers carrying a carcass of a mammal. Analysing the images retrieved from camera traps two-days ago, forest officials were shocked to see poaching inside the sanctuary, despite the vigil.
 
 BC Lokesh, range forest officer at Hanur, said, “We had set up cameras on various locations to monitor movement of animals and people. A few temples are also there in the area. Based on the images we got, we have taken two persons into custody and interrogations are on to find out more details.”
 
 According to the forest officials, the arrested men were natives of Mariamangala and Shagyam villages, which are close to the range. “The arrested are identified as Jaanu and Venkatesha. We suspect that there could be more people involved in the episode. We are still investigating,” a senior official from the sanctuary said.
 
 Ramesh also revealed that they have recovered two rifles from the duo. “The team had also eaten the meat of a deer they had hunted. We have recovered the animal’s skin and bones from the spot,” he said.
 
 Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary is a crucial link between Bandipur and Bannerghatta National Park, and is a haven for several protected animals. This also makes it attractive to poachers. However, constant vigilance and patrolling by forest officials have helped crack down on illegal activities here.
