A big cat in the forests of Kabini Wildlife Sanctuary is garnering quite a fan following. One look at his pictures and you’ll know why. He’s striking – in the way only predatory felines can be. Known to conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts as ‘Torn Ear’ (or Temple Male), this eight-year-old leopard reportedly roams around a huge territory of 40-odd kilometres, guarding it ferociously from other males. At the same time, he often seems unperturbed by human presence, giving ample photo opportunity to those on a safari.
 
 Neeraj Bantia, an entrepreneur and wildlife enthusiast, has been following Torn Ear for close to five years, and is full of stories about how he guards his huge territory in Kabini. He once fought and won over an 11-year-old male whom conservationists call Scar Face.
 
 “Torn Ear is a show-stopper. He loves sitting on top of an old, abandoned temple [hence the name], and on tree-tops. Our presence doesn’t bother him much,” says Bantia, who remembers how on a trip once Torn Ear sauntered on to the road where their vehicle was, and hovered around for about half an hour, much to their delight.
 
 Wildlife enthusiast Aravind Srinivasan has been visiting Kabini for the last 15 years, and considers Torn Ear to be one of the oldest and boldest leopards he has seen.
 
 The animal, he says, is nonchalant and is easy to spot. “He loves walking on the road and every photographer would have had photos of him walking towards them. We get to see him for close to an hour, which is not common among leopards,” he says.
