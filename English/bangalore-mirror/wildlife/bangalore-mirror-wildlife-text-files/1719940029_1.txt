Experts point to resilience of wildlife in unexpected urban ecosystems after researchers discover new species of frog thriving in heart of Bengaluru

A team of researchers from various national and international organisations has identified and documented a new species of frog thriving amidst the urban landscape of Bengaluru.
 
Experts say the discovery marks a significant milestone in biodiversity research and highlights the resilience of wildlife in unexpected urban ecosystems.

The new species has been named ‘Sphaerotheca varshaabhu’, attributed to its behavior of coming out of burrows during the early showers. The amphibian exhibits distinctive characteristics that set it apart from known frog species.

Dr Deepak P, the lead researcher, stumbled upon this species during a routine biodiversity survey conducted in the city. The team utilised advanced genetic analysis, morphological studies, and bioacoustics to confirm the distinctiveness of this newly discovered amphibian. “This discovery challenges our preconceptions about where new species can be found. The fact that such a unique frog has been living right under our noses in the heart of Bengaluru city is truly remarkable,” said Dr Deepak.

Researchers say the species has adapted to its urban surroundings, displaying behaviors and physical attributes that enable it to navigate the challenges posed by urbanization. The discovery emphasizes the need for continued exploration of urban ecosystems and the preservation of biodiversity in areas heavily impacted by human activities.

“Researchers are still clueless on the role of urban and peri-urban green locales supporting biodiversity but the current research gives us an insight and hope on how larger spaces and water bodies could be conserving the species in an urban context,” says Dr Chetan Nag KS, Associate Professor from Jain University.

“We hope that this discovery prompts increased attention to the importance of urban biodiversity conservation, specifically the permanent water bodies in the human habited landscapes” added Dr KP Dinesh Scientist E, Zoological Survey of India (ZSI).

According to Dr Dinesh, who has already been involved in discovering more than 45 new species of frogs from India, many more new species are awaiting formal description shortly from the country as many researchers have geared up exploring the vast diversity of amphibians from the country.

Other researchers included Annemarie Ohler from NMNH, France. The team of researchers is from Mount Carmel College, Bengaluru; Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Western Regional Centre (WRC), Pune; JAIN (Deemed- to- be-University), Bengaluru; Institute of Systematics, Evolution, Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES), Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru; Department of Zoology, Yuvaraja College, University of Mysore and others.
