T Raja, aka Auto Raja, is known for his philanthropy and the destitute home he runs at Doddagubbi village near Lingarajapuram. Now he is faced with the charge of keeping some protected animal and bird species.
 
 A complaint filed with the chief wildlife warden, Karnataka accuses Raja of keeping peacocks, crocodile eggs and parakeets in violation of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. Raja denies any wrong-doing.
 
 “Raja had permission to keep exotic animal species. Since he was keeping some protected species, we brought it to the notice of the chief wildlife warden,” said Sharath R Babu, honorary wildife warden. Raja had started acquiring the animals for a mini-park in his one-acre plot at Doddagubbi. He had acquired 18 crocodile eggs, two peacocks and some parakeets. Wildlife sleuths said he had built a 10ft x 10ft pond to accommodate crocodiles.
 
 “We need to find out how he got them. We have asked the authorities to withdraw the permission given to him to keep exotic animal species,” said Sharath. 
 
 “While he had permission to keep exotic species like love birds, he could not house protected animals,” Sharath said, adding that authorities have been asked to seize the animals.
 
 Raja said he had got them from Hogenakkal. “I thought they could be used for providing therapy for the inmates. I was not aware keeping such animals were a violation.”
 
 He has since returned the peacocks and the crocodile eggs to the authorities. “I have decided not to keep any such species henceforth,” he said.
