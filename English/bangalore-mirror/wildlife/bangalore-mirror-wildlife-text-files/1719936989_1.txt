Conservationists Dheeraj Aithal, 30, and Pradeep Hegde, 23, decided to spread the message on the importance of protecting frogs through a short film after discovering a new species in the the Western Ghats. Titled the Last Hop(e), the film captures the toads’ struggle for their survival and the threat they face. Short of funds, the duo is now planning to crowd-fund the film. The duo says making a wildlife film is no easy task. “Shooting was tough. We realised that we were running short of funds. We mailed a few friends and managed to get some funds last year. The whole intention of this 15-minute documentary is to spread the message of conservation by visiting schools, NGOs and conducting workshop, screening the movie and spreading awareness,” he said.
