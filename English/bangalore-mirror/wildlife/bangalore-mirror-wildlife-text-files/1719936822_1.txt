Relatives turn violent, attack police, burn autorickshaw
 
 Protests erupted when a poacher was shot dead by forest officials in a gun battle in Cauvery Wildlife range in Cheelandavadi forest near Sathanur of Ramanagaram District.
 
 
 
 
 
 The deceased was identified as Gurumurthy (23), a resident of Doddalahalli village of Kanakapura taluk in Ramanagaram district.
 
 On a tip-off, officials gave chase to the four poachers and cornered them in an area of the forest. However, the poachers attacked the officials with guns, and Gurumurthy was killed in the return firing. The others managed to escape. The matter was aggravated when the kith and kin of the deceased rushed to the office of the forest department and tried to assault the officials.
 
 Cops had to be deployed to bring the matter under control. The protestors pelted stones and abused the forest officials in their presence. A police van’s glass and mirror were damaged in the pelting.
 
 ‘Bring him out, we will kill him on the spot’
 
 With police deploying more force at the spot, the protestors were heard shouting, “bring out the murderer and we will kill him on the spot. And then you may arrest us.”
 The protestors shifted the body of the deceased near the forest office and later to the wildlife checkpost. Here they attacked the checkpost and set an auto-rickshaw on fire. Things calmed down later when superintendent of police of Ramanagaram B Ramesh conducted a meeting with DCF of Cauvery Wildlife Range Ramesh Banath and promised compensation to the family of the deceased.
 
 The body was sent to Rajarajeshwari hospital for post-mortem.
