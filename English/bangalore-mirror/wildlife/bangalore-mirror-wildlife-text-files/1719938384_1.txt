Migrant workers stare at uncertainty

After spending over a month with no job and barely any means to survive in Bengaluru, 45-year-old Jamal Mondal, a migrant labourer who returned to his hometown Gosaba in South 24 Parganas district on Monday, was happy to be reunited with his family. 

But his happiness was short-lived. On Thursday morning, along with his four daughters and wife, Mondal was jostling outside a relief camp for two loafs of bread and a tarpaulin sheet to spend the nights at a cyclone shelter, as his one-storey mud house was washed away by Amphan on Wednesday night.

"On Monday, when I reached home, I thought my sufferings were over. But I was wrong. The lockdown took away my job and the cyclone took away everything I was left with," Mondal said. 

His is not the only such story of despair. Hundreds of migrant labourers in South 24 Parganas alone have lost their jobs due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and are left with nothing due to the monstrous cyclone now.

Jamir Ali, 35, decided to go to other states in search of work after the devastating Cyclone Aila in 2009.

"After an arduous journey of 15 days by foot, truck and bus, I had managed to reach home on Tuesday. I was hopeful that everything would be fine, but the worse was waiting to happen," he said. Ali's house has been destroyed and since Wednesday night, there is no trace of his younger brother, who had gone out to tie down their boat near the embankment.

For the residents of the area, the fight for survival with nature and wildlife is a routine affair.
