She will be known as the mother of Arabian Mau cats for eternity. Petra Mueller, an environmental consultant for a German company in Dubai, lives with 220 Maus, 14 desert dogs and two Bedouin boys, Mohammed (18) and Sayeed (20), in her four-bedroom villa. While she rescued the boys from a camel trader to whom they were sold as children, she rescued the cats from eternal obscurity.   When Mueller moved to Dubai from Germany in 1993, she noticed that the desert landscape was fast chaning to accomodate villas and high rise buildings. Caught in the change-crossfire was the wildlife, especially the desert cats. Her tryst with the Maus began an afternoon in 2003, when a cat sauntered into her villa. “I had never seen such a cat before,” said Mueller who was in the city recently. She gave the feline some water; the next day two more paid her visit, then five...soon they just kept coming. One distinguishing trait of the Arabian Mau is that it weeps and cannot live alone. They found company and love in Mueller.   Mueller wrote to the World Cat Federation (WCF) informing them about the “strange cats”. In November 2007, the WCF examined Mueller’s Arabian Mau cats and found them original. In August 2009, the Arabian Mau cats were approved as an International Breed by the Federation. Mueller has a book on each one of her 220 cats. “I recognise them by one unique character,” she said. The playful ones are called Saddam Hussein, Papa Dennis, Maya, Roger, Fanta, Othello, Tom, Jerry, while the reclusive ones are named Talking, Manu, Prince, Sir John, Charlie. They all sleep in bunkers of three placed all over the four-bedroom house. Mueller who lost her husband and teenage daughter in a car accident in Germany in 1977 never remarried. “My family now are my Maus, dogs and my Bedouin boys. I get all the love that I need from them,” said the ma of Maus.
