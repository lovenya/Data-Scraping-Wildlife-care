Green heart

OUR congratulations to the beautiful Dia Mirza whose heart is as lovely as her doe eyes. The actor has just been confirmed for an extension for her role as Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Program. Dia’s role has been extended by two years, until 2022. She has long been a voice for change and environmental conservation, and is even an advocate for the UN’s Sustainability Development Goals program. “Now more than ever before, we need to make every effort possible to act on climate, protect wildlife, biodiversity and secure natural resources. Being a Goodwill Ambassador has helped me understand the complexity of issues at hand and the simplicity of solutions,” Dia says.
