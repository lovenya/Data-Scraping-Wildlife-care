Chief minister D V Sadananda Gowda’s residence ‘Krishna’ witnessed high drama on Wednesday evening after a snake slithered onto the lawns facing entrance of the house. However, BBMP’s wildlife volunteers, who were called by CM’s staff, rushed to the spot and rescued the 4-feet-long rat snake. The entry of the snake, which some people termed a ‘bad omen’, was found under a fountain in the lawns.

   Sharath Babu, a honorary wildlife warden, said it was common to find snakes during the season. “We get at least one call from residents in the area about snakes having strayed into their premises.” He, however, said it was the first time his staff were rescuing a snake from the house during Gowda’s tenure.
