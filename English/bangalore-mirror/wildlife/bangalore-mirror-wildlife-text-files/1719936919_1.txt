The officials of Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) have learnt their lesson from prevous animal attacks and have decided to increase the height of the bear safari enclosure.
 
 Barring a few shocking incidents, is a popular destination among tourist circuit.
 
 But with the increasing concentration of animals on its premises, the BBP has seen clashes within the animals in recent times. Said to be the first in its 45-years of its existence, the park witnessed a rude shock in March 2017 when three sloth bears attacked a deer inside the herbivore safari area.
 
 Increasing the existing wall around bear safari by at least 3 to 5 feet, the BBP has invited tenders. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, BBP Executive Director Santosh Kumar said, “The maintenance of bears at the park is entrusted to Wildlife SoS organisation while we only provide infrastructure. Recently, they requested us to increase the height of wall. It will ensure that no bear strays out of its enclosure.”
 
 Much to the surprise of many and in front of several tourists, three sloth bears had preyed on a spotted deer that was grazing inside the herbivore safari area.
 
 Before pouncing on the deer, the leopards had chased and attacked the deer. 
 
 Soon after the incident, the officials had sealed the boundary between herbivore safari area and sloth bear area. But considering that either bears or deer could stray out, the officials have resorted to the last measure of increasing the height of the wall.
 
 Raghavendra, Assistant Executive engineer said that the existing wall around the mount was found to be insufficient to retain the animals.
 
 “The decision is not based on the recent incident but a precautionary measure and also as requested by the SoS organisation officials,” he explained. This apart, the BBP will also build an elephant proof grating at the Kitchen Gate located close to the boating lake.
