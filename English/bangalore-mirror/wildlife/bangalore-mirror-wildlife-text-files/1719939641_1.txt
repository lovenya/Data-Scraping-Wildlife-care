On Friday the owner of a farm in DB Kuppe range of Nagarhole Tiger Reserve in Mysuru district was booked for electrocuting an elephant to death. The elephant died in the early hours of Thursday. The police stated that the elephant was aged between 30-35 years and it died after coming into contact with electrical wire.

The accused was identified as Uday, a local farmer. Uday escaped from the village after the incident but was later identified and booked by the police.

The forest authorities booked a case against him under Sections 9 and 22 of the Wildlife Protection Act at the Antarasante police station.

Wildlife activists had raised a concern over the incident and demanded that the forest authorities should take action to protect elephants from getting electrocuted.

The electricity was supplied through solar power generation. Activists alleged that the electric fences were erected by the farmers by illegally taking the electricity connection.

Joseph Hoover, a wildlife activist said, “We are losing elephants frequently to electrocution in Karnataka due to rising human-animal conflicts. Farmers try to protect their crops and plantation by illegally drawing power from overhead lines and connecting it to the fence. Electrocution of an elephant, tiger, leopard, or bear, is an offence under the Wildlife Protection Act.”
