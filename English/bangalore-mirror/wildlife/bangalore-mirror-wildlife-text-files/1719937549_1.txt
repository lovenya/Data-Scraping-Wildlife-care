The Moving Waters Film Festival (MWFF) is here again. In its third edition, the festival that explores rivers, lakes and oceans and the life they support will engage with conservationists, researchers, activists, artists and citizens in Bengaluru on September 22 and 23. T Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan will host the event. 

The 2018 shortlist features, amongst others, Suresh Elamon’s Kananam: The Spirit of Silent Valley, a story of a people’s movement to protect the Kunthi River and the valley it flows through; in Racing Extinction Oscar-winner Louie Psihoyos assembles a team of artists and activists intent on showing the world never-before-seen images that expose issues of endangered species and mass extinction; Blue Heart, by Britton Caillouette and Patagonia, documents the fight to save the last wild rivers in the Balkans; Ocean’s Monopoly examines ‘how nations use science to conquer the sea’ and what it would mean to reclaim land indefinitely beyond coastlines; and Marko Röhr, Kim Saarniluoto and a mystical water spirit take us into the icy waters of Finland’s Lake Saimaa in Tale of a Lake.

The full screening list will be updated in the week leading up to the festival.

The speakers’ list includes dolphin biologist Coralie D’Lima, who will talk about how Irrawaddy dolphins and fishers help each other in Odisha’s Chilika Lagoon; Silpa V Kumar (IFS), whose talk is paired with the film Kananam, will share her experience as a former wildlife warden in Silent Valley National Park; Tiasa Adhya, co-founder of The Fishing Cat Project, reveals the contradictions in policies that drive habitat loss for fishing cats and wildlife conservationist Samad Kottur will recount efforts to save the Tungabhadra River. Entry to the festival is free.
