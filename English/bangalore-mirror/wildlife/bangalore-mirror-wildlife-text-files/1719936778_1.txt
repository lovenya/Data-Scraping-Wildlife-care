The rush of photographers to the spot after a pair of leopards was seen on a hillock near Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary has caused forest department officials to react fast and chase the animals away by bursting firecrackers.
 
 
 
 
 Speaking Bangalore Mirror, deputy conservator of forest (DCF) Ballari Takhat Singh Ranawat said that the leopards that were sighted by the photographer have gone back.
 
 “Since it was the mating season, they probably came from the nearby sanctuary. They did not create any problem to the villagers and were seen at the top of the hillock.
 
 Since the sight was attracting a lot of attention from the people, especially photographers, as well as the spot was close to the village surrounded by sugarcane and banana plantations, we decided to burst crackers and chase them away. From the past two days, they have not been sighted. Continuous monitoring is taking place in the area,” he said.
 
 A team led by the DCF, wildlife warden Dr Arun SK, RFOs Bhaskar and Nagaraj RFO have combed the area. Sources said that the area is known for leopard movement but this time it got highlighted as it was captured on camera.
 
 Dr Arun said there was no panic and no villagers were injured.
