For many biking enthusiasts, Bandipur is a preferred route. But a recent video in which a tiger was seen chasing a biker at Muthanga forest range (Kerala) that is adjoining Bandipur forest, has got them thinking . 

In the video, it is seen that the pillion rider is trying to film his forest route. However, the two riders get the shock of their life to see a tiger trying to chase them from one side of the road to the other. Bandipur forests connect Karnataka to Tamil Nadu and Kerala. While many bikers prefer to take the Bandipur route to travel to Ooty others take it to travel to Wayanad (the deviation for Tamil Nadu and Kerala routes are after the last big Karnataka town-Gundlupet).

Currently, Bandipur roads are closed in the nights. However, the road is preferred by many for the sighting of animals. “Bikes are not allowed inside Nagarahole forest. It is better not to travel on bikes in forests. Cars or other four wheelers can at least give protection to the travellers, “ said Manjunath S, a wild life enthusiast. Praveen Kumar, another wild life enthusiast said that it was not safe for bikers to travel in the forests. 

However, forest department officials said there was no plan to ban bikes. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Punati Sridhar told BM, “As of now, there is no plan to ban two-wheelers on Bandipur Road and it is also impractical.
