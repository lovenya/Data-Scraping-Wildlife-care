Drawing curtains over the six-year-long struggle by hundreds of frontline staff of Karnataka Forest Department (KFD), chief minister Siddaramaiah has cleared the proposal to increase their hardship allowance. While chairing the 8th State Wildlife Board meeting at his home office – Krishna – on Friday, the CM agreed to increase the hardship allowance for various ranks posted in Wildlife divisions of KFD. The decision will cost the government Rs 2.5 crore annually. 
 
 On July 15, 2014 CM Siddaramaiah had approved a proposal to pay Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,500 as hardship allowance to the KFD staff. The finance department had scaled this down to Rs 350 from Rs 500. But when the issue came up yet again before the CM during the Board meeting, he was visibly upset over the prolonged delay in sanctioning the allowance and also expressed unhappiness at its reduction, a source told Bangalore Mirror. The delay in sanctioning the hardship allowance was raked up by State Wildlife Board member Kadaiah, to which the CM reacted strongly. 
 	  	“Why has it been delayed despite previous approval?” the CM questioned officials, going on to add, “You send me the detail proposal and I will approve it.” As per the latest approval, personnel posted in Wildlife Division of various forest circles across the state will get hardship allowance ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,500 per month based on their ranks. There have been numerous cases of forest staffers being attacked by wild animals with the recent one being a bear attack on two forest staff at Bhadra Tiger Reserve. When the two staff members were in the forest doing their work, a sloth bear attacked and injured them. They were later admitted to a hospital in Chikkamagaluru.
