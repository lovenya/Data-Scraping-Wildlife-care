The dream of having a bridge built across the Sharavathi backwaters between Sigandur and Kalasavalli might take more time to become a reality. The foundation for the bridge was laid in February this year. Unfortunately, it is now learnt that the project has been put on hold temporarily.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Mansukh Mandaviya said the construction of bridge across Sharavathi backwaters between Sigandur and Kalasavalli was included in the annual plan 2018-19 for Karnataka with an estimated cost of Rs 530 crore. However, the work was substituted by another works on the request of Karnataka government as the project involves wildlife clearance as it falls under eco-sensitive zone around Sharavathi wildlife sanctuary. The bridge is expected to reduce travel time between Karur-Barangi hoblis. 

Residents have been demanding for the bridge since 1964 as they have been dependent on ferries provided by department of Ports and Inlands Water transportation to reach the mainland. The construction of the bridge has remained a poll promise for several years. The number of people visiting Chowdeshwari Temple in Sigandhur has been increasing over the years. After a dam was built across Sharavati, villages in Karuru and Barangi turned islands.

Former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa in 2008-09 announced that a bridge across the backwater will be constructed at the cost of Rs 165 crore. A senior NHAI officer told BM, “The foundation was laid for the bridge in February. The project requires wildlife clearance. Once the clearance is obtained, the work will be approved. The project is on hold for the time being,” the officer said.
