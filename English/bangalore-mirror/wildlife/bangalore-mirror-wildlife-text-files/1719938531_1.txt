In yet another case of cruelty against animals, poachers killed three jackals in Hiriyur, Chitradurga, on Saturday, after feeding them explosives-laden food. 

One male and two female jackals died of injuries when the food exploded in their mouths. Officials said they were being poached for meat. 

 Locals saw the carcasses of the jackals in a field and contacted the Chitradurga Forest Department. Under the guidance of K Chandrashekhara Nayak, Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), Chitradurga Division, Forest Department officials, including Assistant Conservator of Forests, Neelakantappa, Range Forest Officer Sri Harsha, Deputy Range Forest Officer Pradeep Kesari, Forest Guard Ramanna and staff arrested one of the poachers. 

 “When the team reached the scene of the incident, the killers had loaded the carcasses into gunny bags and were about to flee,” said Raghuram HG, an honorary wildlife warden with the Chitradurga Forest Department. “As soon as we arrived, we caught hold of one of the poachers along with a vehicle, a Scooty Pep. The man, Bijju, has been taken into police custody while another man by the name Vinod is still on the loose. We have seized snares and other hunting equipment from them,” he added. 

According to Raghuram, in such cases, jail time can go up to seven years upon conviction. This incident comes months after the brutal killing of a pregnant wild elephant in Kerala. The elephant died after eating a cracker-stuffed pineapple. People living at the village in Kerala offered the pineapple to the pregnant elephant after it entered the area in search of food. The incident triggered widespread condemnation.
