After successfully tracking tigers with the help of radio collars and documenting their behaviour, wildlife conservationists have now embarked on the task of studying reptiles in the state’s rain forests. 

Scientists at the Agumbe research station, who have been studying the lifecycle of king cobras, are adding rat snakes to the list of reptiles they plan to study.

Replying to a question by Shashil Namoshi on the floor of the Council, Chief Minister and Forest Minister B S Yeddyurappa said, “Scientists have successfully inserted chips 

in two king cobras to study how the rescued reptiles adapt to the environment after translocation. The progress made in this study has encouraged the herpetologist to conduct the same experiment with rat snakes as subjects.”

When asked about the success and feasibility of the project, reminding him of the debate on the issue of putting radio collars on tigers a few years ago, Yeddyurappa justified saying that the collars are not as invasive as they used to be. “Today’s technology has made it easier for scientists to study these animals. All these techniques are in favour of the species being studied and the ecology,” he said.

The team of herpetologists at the research station lead by Dr Gowri Shankar has rescued two king cobras along with rat snakes. It has implanted miniature transmitters in the reptiles. Later the snakes were translocated to a new habitat and their behaviour was meticulously monitored and documented.
