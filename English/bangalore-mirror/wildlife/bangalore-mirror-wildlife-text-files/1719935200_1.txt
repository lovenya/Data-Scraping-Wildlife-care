Ramu M (in pic) works as a designer in a national newspaper. When he is not making layouts for the daily, he is busy watching birds and more interestingly, capturing the fluttering wings. Recently, his passion for photography brought him the reputed Excellence Federation Internationale de l'Art Photographique, France. 

 Ramu’s journey as a shutterbug started in 2009 after he attended a workshop by B Srinivas — an eminent wildlife photographer. “As I glanced through his photos I decided that there was no looking back and I set out on the most adventurous journey. Travelling through states across India I learnt the art of capturing bird behaviours. I eventually realised that there is nothing more thrilling than photography,” Ramu says. 

 He has captured more than 350 varieties of birds. Apart from his recent accolade he received other honours including the associateship of The Royal Photographic Society in London in 2011 (ARPS), Askary Award in 2010 in Karnataka, Best Photographer 2009-10 of YPS, Bangalore, and so on. 

 	Apart from India, his photos have been exhibited in several countries, including South Africa, Germany, UAE and United Kingdom. 

 The 33-year-old photographer has plans of capturing monsoon on camera. He wants to try out macro photography (taking extremely close-up pictures) along with his first love – wildlife photography. “Wildlife photography is not only about clicking those shots. It requires a lot of understanding about places. For instance, it is very important to know which bird migrates during what time of the year,” he says.
