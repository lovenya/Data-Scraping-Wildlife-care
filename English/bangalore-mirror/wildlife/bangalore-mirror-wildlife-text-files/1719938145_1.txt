With a massive hunt underway for a tiger in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park, animal rights activists worry that the fate of the tiger would be similar to that of Avni. Avni was the tigress who was responsible for 13 human deaths and was shot dead in Maharashtra. 

The persons who shot Avni dead have allegedly entered the Bandipur forest to kill the tiger. Activists have written a letter to the Chief Minister, requesting that the animal not be killed and the hunters not be involved in any operations in Karnataka.

The government has assured that they would ensure that the tiger is not killed under any circumstances and will be only tranquilised, captured and sent to Bannerghatta Forest. Arun Prasad, an environmentalist and animal rights activist, says, “We want the hunters Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, his son Asghar Ali and Susheel Kumar be sent out of the state. They would instigate the people and get the support to get the tiger killed. They should not be involved in any operations in the state. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) had assured that they would be made to leave the forest premises but they are still in the forest.”

The PCCF had issued a press release earlier stating that the tiger would be spotted and either captured or shot down within 24 to 48 hours. 

However, PCCF says he wasn’t aware of the press release being issued. Sanjai Mohan, PCCF and chief wildlife warden, says, “The tiger will be captured and sent to Bannerghatta. It is not a case of human-wildlife conflict. The tiger was probably looking for an easy prey and once they find it, they do not go deep into the forest for hunting. We need to think about the people living in the area. We have cameras fixed across the forest to track its movement. Once the tiger is spotted, we will tranquilise and capture it.”
