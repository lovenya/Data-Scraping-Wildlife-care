In a heartening rescue mission on February 20th in Kaggalipura, a Northern Red Muntjac, commonly known as a barking deer, was saved from a perilous situation. The creature had fallen victim to entanglement in barbed wires, resulting in a severe laceration on its thigh.

Colonel Dr Navaz Shariff, Chief Veterinarian from People for Animals (PfA) Wildlife Hospital, pointed out the urgency of the situation, stating, “Upon examination, we observed a deep wound caused by the entanglement. Immediate action was crucial to save the deer’s life.”

The rescue team from PfA swiftly administered painkillers, corticosteroids, and a tetanus injection to stabilise the distressed animal. After 36 hours of care, when all vital signs were back to normal, the decision was made to release the deer back into its natural habitat. Dr Madhav, senior veterinarian from PfA, spoke about the steps taken during the recovery process. 

“To prevent capture myopathy, a careful approach was vital. Anaesthesia was administered, and the wound was cleaned with normal saline and povidone-iodine. Due to the depth of the wound, absorbable sutures were placed on both the muscles and the skin. The deer received oxygen therapy and intravenous fluids. Post-operative care involved the application of antiseptic ointment, painkillers, long-acting antibiotics, and a B-complex supplement.”
