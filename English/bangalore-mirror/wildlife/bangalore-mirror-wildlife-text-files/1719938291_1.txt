Karnataka Forest Department have taken two men, one in his late fifties and the other in his thirties, into custody after they were caught selling peafowl feathers illegally in Vidyaranyapura on Sunday.

Rajesh Kumar, a wildlife rescuer, said he found them selling the peafowl feathers near Sri Kalika Durga Parameshwari Temple in Vidyaranyapura and told them it was illegal to sell it without permit and receipt. “They manhandled me. I called the police control room immediately and informed the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF). 

He instructed the Range Forest Officer (RFO) to take immediate action and with the help of the police, these men were taken into RFO’s custody,” he said.

K Ramesh, RFO, said, “We will investigate the matter.” Rajesh added that these feathers are usually brought from different parts of north India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. “They bring it in tonnes via trains. The railway authority does not question them. 

As per the Indian Wildlife Act, peafowl feather should be sold with proper receipts. Only few tribes are allowed to pick these feathers, weigh them and then sell them with receipts. The sellers should also have ID cards, issued by the forest department. 

But in many cases, birds are killed for the feathers, even in south India,” he said. These feathers are sold for Rs 50 or Rs 60 per piece as there is a huge demand.
