Feather procedure for injured urban species - black kites, parakeets, barbets - helps them fly again

In Kengeri, a team of vets at the People for Animals (PFA) hospital have unveiled a transformative technique — ‘imping’ — a lifeline for injured birds to take to the skies again.
 
This approach involves attaching feathers to birds through an overnight operation, saving them from prolonged captivity and providing a rapid path to rehabilitation.

Imping repairs broken or damaged feathers, replacing a damaged feather by joining a donor feather to its shaft using a dowel and glue. The repaired feather naturally molts out, making way for a new feather to grow and replace it. This innovative technique has proven particularly effective for birds entangled in various hazards, such as Chinese manja threads, electric wires, or suffering from dehydration in water bodies.

Colonel Dr Navaz Shariff, chief veterinary surgeon at PFA, said: “We have a feather bank. We perform the imping process on a variety of birds, with a focus on species like black kites, parakeets, and barbets. These birds often lose their feathers and become injured due to entanglements, leading to a loss of their natural instincts.”

Challenges
Birds frequently face perilous situations, with some getting entangled in dangerous threads or electrocuted by electric wires.
 
Dr Shariff narrated the story of a black kite rescued less than two weeks ago, which had lost nearly 50% of its feathers, rendering it unable to fly. The imping procedure became a lifeline for the kite, highlighting the urgency and importance of this surgical technique.

To support imping surgeries, PFA Bangalore collaborates with wildlife conservation centres, urging them to send feathers, particularly from black kites. Feathers are collected daily from the ground and bird enclosures, involving students and other conservation centres.
 
One of the contributors is Gouri Shivogi, a resident of Bengaluru. She has been collecting feathers and giving them to PfA. In a recent incident, she risked her safety to retrieve feathers from a dead black kite on a busy flyover, we are told. Despite lacking professional training, she got hold of the dead kite and gave it to PfA, so that it will help to give other birds a second chance at life and flight. 

Imping process
The imping process involves creating holes in the follicles, and with high-density surgical glue, the feathers are meticulously attached. As the implanted feathers naturally grow back, the artificially attached ones wither and fall away.
 
Dr Madhav from PFA explained: “We have long enclosures where we keep the birds, and we even put them on higher branches, checking if they can fly down, opening their wings to land on the ground. At the hospital we have moved away from the traditional practice of keeping injured birds confined for months until their feathers naturally regrow. Now, birds are released overnight after imping and successful flight testing.
