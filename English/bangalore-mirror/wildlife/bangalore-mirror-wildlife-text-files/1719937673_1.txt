Forest officials successfully retrieved the carcass of a sambar deer on Friday from Yellandur Wildlife Range of the Biligirirangana Hills Tiger Reserve Range. According to Range Forest Officer Mahadevaiah and Wildlife Veterinary Officer of Chamarajanagar Dr Puneet, the male sambar carcass weighed about 46 kg.

Dr Puneet told BM, “We suspect that poachers may have killed the animal in a crude way using stones. They are probably professional hunters. They would have left the carcass behind and fled the spot when some locals saw them. Looking at the skin coat and hair coat of the animal we came to a conclusion that it is a sambar.” 

When the team reached the spot, poachers were probably distributing meat among themselves. The sambar meat fetches a good prize in the market. 

“Since it is difficult to find spotted deer and they move quickly, Sambar deer is targeted. This deer is found in large numbers and does not run when they face humans. Hence poachers often chase them till they reach empty wells and huge pits and are killed crudely mostly with stones and knives. In this case, we did not find any shoot marks not any snare marks,” he said.

The sambar whose populations have declined substantially due to severe hunting and habitat exploitation is a large deer. They are crop raiders and feed on a variety of vegetation. Sambar is nocturnal and males often live alone, and the females live in small herds of up to 16. 

In some areas, the average herd consists of only three or four individuals. Such herds consist of an adult female, her most recent young one, and perhaps a subordinate. They are generally quiet, although all adults can scream and make high-pitch sounds in panic.
