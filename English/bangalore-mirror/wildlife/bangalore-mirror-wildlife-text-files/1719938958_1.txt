Karnataka will soon have its sixth tiger reserve at MM Hills. Sources said that the Centre has given approval in principle and a notification will be issued soon. The tiger census began at Bandipur on Saturday, in Nagarahole on Sunday and will be held at BRT on January 27. Due to the census, the 6 am safari has been cancelled between January 23 and 25 and January 27 and February 1.
 
The fifth tiger census in Nagarahole was organised in Nagarahole with the Monitoring System for Tigers: Intensive Protection and Ecological Status app. The census is being taken in two phases. Due to Covid-19, no volunteers are helping organise the census, but 300 employees of the forest department are conducting it.

In the first stage, the staff will walk five km each day in 91 beats and view the animals, recording their footsteps, faeces, urine, voice, border identification, etc., in the app.
 
The census includes collection of data on herbivores, including elephants, gaurs and other animals, apart from tigers. Forest guards have been equipped with personal digital assistants and GPS devices to capture data regarding tiger sightings, deaths, wildlife crime and ecological observations. The staff have been trained by experts from the Wildlife Institute of India. The census will end on February 8 at Bandipur. It will be taken up in 112 beats, divided into three blocks.
