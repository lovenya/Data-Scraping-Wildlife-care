The BBMP initiative, which began in 2009, was a community project. However, the programme has been in a limbo after politicians allegedly tried to hijack it and get identity cards for supporters.
 
 The force comprised volunteers who devoted their time but did not get paid for their services. Yet, the forest department of Mahadevapura zone has submitted to the BBMP a bill for Rs 1 lakh for the service.
 
 The bill (work code 000-10-I-G-O-P-MI-031) is said to be for ‘identification of tree wardens/ green police in Mahadevapura zone’. 
 Shocked greens
 Environmentalists are shocked. “Volunteers do not get paid. There have been no public meetings and no booklets have been distributed. I don’t get where they have spent money for the project which has not even begun,” says Vinay Sreenivas, a member of Hasiru Usiru, an NGO.
 
 Sharat Babu, the ecological advisor to BBMP who pioneered the project, says identity cards were issued to 33 people as green police and then stopped. “The force was to rescue injured wildlife, ensure no trees are cut down illegally and promote the feeling of ownership of green cover,” said the consultant, who is yet to receive his honorarium from the Palike for the last one year. The bill for the 33 cards too has not been cleared.
 
 Krishnappa, Deputy Conservator of Forest (North) says no budgeting been done for the project as it has been discontinued. So the question of who approved the bill remains a mystery.
 
 A senior forest department official said the money is split into smaller amounts and then present bills, so the ‘thievery’ goes unnoticed.
 
 Even birds haven’t been spared. The Mahadevapura forest department has sent a bill for Rs 15,000 (work code 000-10-N-G-O-P-FO-008) to BBMP to create bird conservation in the zone. 
 
 Department sources said, BBMP launched a bird conservation project only in 2007. “It was called Banadilagi Marali Banni in Gayathri Devi Park, Rajajinagar. After that, we had smaller private programmes,” he says.
