Sandeep Satyanarayan, 26

Once upon a time…
Was an ex- RJ, emceeing shows.

Then they clinched the deal. 
When I walked in for the interview, I wasn’t wearing the jersey. Coach Ray Jennings asked me why I wasn’t wearing it. I quipped that they didn’t have my size which I owe to all the UB products I’ve consumed. That comment caught Siddarth Mallya’s interest and it broke the ice well.

Travelling with the team
It was overwhelming. I mean seeing Jacques Kallis, Boucher on either side of you in the bus can be quite something. I was scared. It was only about a week back, when I hosted a show where I had to play some games with the players that I got comfortable with and now we are chaddi-buddies.

Personal encounters
Anil is very nice and very smart. He understands when to give us time and when not to. He likes to share his experiences. When I asked him about what’s the right SLR to get, he spoke about different cameras. The thing with Anil is if you get him started on an interesting topic, he gets into it, he really talks. The others are to the point.

Life of a party? 
Roelof van der Merwe. I have a video of him mixing the drinks for the team at a party. Even Yuvraj Singh qualifies because wherever he goes, he makes an impression. 


Aneesh Surendra, 24

Once upon a time…
worked as a sports journalist and finished his MBA from MICA.

Then they clinched the deal. 
I wrote a fictional and funny piece, where Anil Kumble is ribbing Shane Warne. Anil Kumble saw this piece, smiled and then passed it onto the others.

Personal encounters
Kevin Pietersen taught me how to swim. He shared some breathing techniques with me and I have been practising them. And frankly, they have worked and I am fairly comfortable swimming now.

The Jim Carrey of the team?
Ross Taylor. He is a wonderful guy and has no airs about him.


Sandeep M R, 25

Once upon a time…
A musician and composer, had done a small role in the Kannada film, 35/100.

Then they clinched the deal. 
Sandeep M R: I made a simple film on the ‘Spirit of Sports.’ The coach Ray Jennings saw it and said, “This is what I am looking for.”

Personal encounters
Sandeep M R: I was wearing this T shirt that has ‘I Run’ written on it. Dale, who is a runner, liked it and took a photo of it. Because he liked it so much, my friend and I decided to gift him a similar tee. We hunted for it in the city and then late in the 
night, we knocked on his door and gave it to a very sleepy Dale. He really liked it. I also enjoyed the interactions I have had with the coach’s wife, Alison Jennings. 

Party animal?
Sandeep M R: All South African players. I have never seen them miss any parties. Kevin Pietersen too. I once saw him get ready for a party within minutes. 


Ashish Parmar, 30

Once upon a time…
A freelance wildlife photographer, was busy shooting birds.

Then they clinched the deal. 
Ashish: We were given 75 minutes to shoot some lads playing on the field and submit the best three. I decided to go offbeat. I shot a totally beaten ball with the coach’s shoes in the background. The second photo shows a bowler with his fingers on the seam, the wickets and the batsman in the background. The third photo was of a fielder in mid-air.

Travelling with the team
Ashish Parmar: The players too never kept us at bay. When I go to photograph them, they take my camera to see how it has come and sometimes they take my camera and shoot each other’s pictures too.

Mr Popular?
Ashish Parmar: Robin Uthappa and Kumble. All players actually respect Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble. While they address the other players by their first name, they address the two as Rahul bhai and Anil bhai.
