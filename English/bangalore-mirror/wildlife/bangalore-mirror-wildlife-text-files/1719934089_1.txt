For all its attractions, including the relics of legendary empires, ancient temples, pristine beaches and bounteous wildlife, hardsold with the tag line ‘One State, Many Worlds’, Karnataka lags behind other south Indian destinations like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil 
Nadu and Kerala. From a high of 5.34 lakh foreign tourists in 2007, the numbers fell to 2.29 lakh in 2009. By contrast, Tamil Nadu received 23.69 lakh tourists, Andhra Pradesh witnessed 7.95 lakh visitors and Kerala — God’s Own Country — welcomed 5.48 lakh tourists in 2009.


Commenting on the trend, K Vishwanatha Reddy, director, Karnataka State Tourism Department Corporation (KSTDC), said, “Even though we are lagging behind the other states, we are improving steadily. Only during the global recession of 2008-09 were we hit. The numbers are rising again now. Compared to the previous year, this year there has been a good response from foreign tourists. 

Till June, we received about 1.63 lakh tourists, while it was 1.03 lakh till the same month the previous year On the reasons for Karnataka falling behind on the foreign-tourist front, Reddy pointed out that it was their pilgrim centres that have given a boost to Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. “Tourists flock to these states because of this and get attracted to other places as well,” he said. “But we don’t want to lose out. We have been taking part in international festivals and road shows. Our minister has attended fairs in various European countries. Several tour operators have promised to include Karnataka in their tour packages,”
