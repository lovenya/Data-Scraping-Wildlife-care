The persistent dumping of garbage in Bengaluru’s lakes has raised serious concerns among environmental activists. Despite numerous lakes being allocated for maintenance, the efforts appear inadequate, leading to deteriorating conditions. Raghavendra B Pachhapur, a prominent lake activist, highlighted the gravity of the situation, emphasising the urgent need for systemic waste management at lakes. With the monsoon shower, several lakes are seeing an inflow of garbage into the water body. “Many lakes are handed over for maintenance, but the work is not carried out properly. We have seen waste being buried under soil or burned, particularly at Doddakallasandra Lake,” said Pachhapur.

Similarly, the situation is grim at Dorekere Lake, where the lake bed is often covered in plastic waste. Dorekere is not only a local natural resource but also a haven for various bird species, including migratory birds. Pachhapur and his team discovered nests of grey herons while attempting to clean the lake, which halted their efforts to avoid disturbing the birds. “In Dorekere Lake, we have witnessed the lake bed full of plastic. It’s a vital habitat for many birds, including migratory species. In the last five years, we have seen similar situations in many lakes, including Chunchaghatta and Kothanur Lakes,” he added.
 
The activist further pointed out the ineffective waste management practices that exacerbate the problem. “If a contract is given for lake maintenance, it should be done thoroughly. Waste is often found floating on the lake surface and settled on the lake bed,” he said. Last year, the dry spell revealed a parched Dorekere Lake bed, which allowed for a temporary cleanup. However, this year’s first rainfall brought back a staggering amount of solid waste, undoing their efforts. “The sight of so much waste being washed back into the lake after a single rainfall was shocking. There is a dire need for systematic changes in handling solid waste. The contractors maintaining the lake are not doing it properly,” added Pachhapur.

The lake activists state that there should be a comprehensive approach to tackle the waste problem, emphasising the importance of community involvement and stricter enforcement of waste management policies. They further added that without significant intervention, the ecological health of these lakes will continue to decline, affecting both wildlife and local communities.
