A Bengal monitor lizard was rescued at Gangamma circle on Tuesday by a wildlife rescuer.

The rescuer Rajesh received a call in the afternoon and reached Gangamma circle to rescue the lizard. The animal was rescued unharmed. Right now, it is being kept under observation. It will be released into the wild after two to three days.

Generally, these reptiles are not found in urban areas. “There can only be reasons behind finding these wild animals in urban areas. One is trading of live animals as people like to keep these animals as pets and second it can be sold to extract their skin, teeth and bones,” said Rajesh.
