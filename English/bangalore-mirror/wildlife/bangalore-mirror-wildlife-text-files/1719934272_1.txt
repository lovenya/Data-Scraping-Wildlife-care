Seems like the BBMP has not learnt any lessons from the Mysore episode which saw two wild elephants going on the rampage, killing a guard. A jumbo at a Mysore mutt too had caused tension after it disobeyed its mahout. Yet, the BBMP, which is holding Dasara festival for the first time, is not prepared for such an eventuality. “The BBMP, which handles and rescues wildlife species, doesn’t have a single tranquilliser gun to handle them,” said a senior BBMP official.
 
 The matter gains significance in the light of the 10-day Dasara celebrations that began at Ram Mandir grounds on September 28 at Rajajinagar, which gets about 5,000 visitors every day. “In case of an emergency, the BBMP has to rely on Bannerghatta National Park, whose officials need at least an hour to reach Rajajinagar for bringing the situation under control,” said the civic official. 
 
 Sharath Babu, a wildlife expert, said elephants, including captive ones, are not comfortable in the city conditions. “Huge crowds, loud noises, asphalted roads or pungent smells irritate them (jumbos) and they may go berserk,” he said.
   there is no cage either
 “BBMP doesn't even have a cage, which is a must during emergencies,” said an expert.
 
 Meanwhile, deputy mayor S Harish, admitted the BBMP did not have the right equipment. “We have allocated funds this year for the purpose. The equipment, including the tranquilliser gun, will be purchased soon.”
