Tourists and officials at Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) were witness to a strange incident on Wednesday afternoon when a sloth bear preyed on a spotted deer inside the bear safari area of BBP.
 
 
 
 
 
 Sources at BBP revealed that a sloth bear housed at the rescue centre operated by Wildlife SoS chased and attacked a spotted deer that was roaming in the area and
 subsequently a few other bears too preyed on the deer. 
 
 “The incident of hunting by animals has been reported for the first time inside BBP. Otherwise all animals are fed by our staff. There is a passage between herbivore safari and bear safari using which the deer may have sneaked into the bear territory. With the incident we will take up measures to seal the boundary and bring in precautionary measures,” revealed Suresh, Deputy Director of BBP.
 
 According to eye witnesses, a sloth bear had ambushed a deer that was roaming inside the bear enclosure. After the deer was killed and dragged by the bear, other bears too feasted on the carcass of the deer.
 
 Marked with specific enclosures, animals attacking other animals were unheard as all of them were fed by BBP personnel. But for the first time, an omnivore like sloth bear attacking a deer has been reported.
