The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to study the possible impacts of the proposed Gundia Hydro Electric Project on the ecology of the green belt, has stated in its report that that setting up a reservoir would upset the ecological balance in the area.   The ministry has uploaded the report on its website and has invited comments and views from the stakeholders within 45 days commencing from May 23.   H A Kishor Kumar, president of Malenadu Janapara Horata Samiti, Hassan, said, “In its report, the WGEEP has advised the MoEF to deny environmental and forest clearance to the controversial project. Since the recommendation comes from a government-constituted panel, we hope the project will be cancelled.”   The report says that execution of the project will cause large-scale land cover changes in this basin. The impacts on the wildlife habitat as well as biodiversity would be caused not only by the submergence, but also associated activities like construction of buildings and roads. Besides altering the hydrological regime of the river basin, diversion of Kumaradhara river to the Bettakumari dam will deprive the temple township at Subrahmanya its perennial source of water.   The panel has classified the area where the project is planned as ecologically sensitive zone (ESZ) and advises against construction of large storage dams there. It said the tunnel access to the main underground powerhouse is also planned in an area where it would cause disturbance to one of the few remaining patches of primary evergreen forests of the Gundia basin.   The project, proposed by Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) in the Gundia river basin in the Hassan and Dakshina Kannada districts, is expected to generate 200 MW power.   The comments/views to the report can be sent t amit.love@nic.in and sv.godavarthi@nic.in.
