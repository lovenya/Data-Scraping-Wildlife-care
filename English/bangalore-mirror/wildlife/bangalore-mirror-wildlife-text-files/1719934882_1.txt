A wild Royal Bengal Tiger which had sparked panic by sneaking into Odisha’s Nandankanan Zoo, possibly in search of a mate, was captured by zoo authorities on Tuesday.  
 The tiger had been roaming freely in the premises after entering the zoo on Monday night, forcing authorities to shut down part of the park. Officials said the tiger had been moving around the enclosure of Sara, a tigress, possibly indicating an impulse to mate, according to sources.
   “The animal was trapped in the tiger safari by tracking its movement through CCTV cameras,” said Sudarshan Panda, the director of Nandankanan Zoo. A 20-member team had been set up to capture the tiger. 
   ""Our team members found through the CCTV camera that it entered the first gate of the tiger safari at about 12.30 am. Immediately, the gate was closed from behind,"" an official said. Later, the zoo staff closed one gate after another, said C R Mishra, deputy director of the zoo. 
   ""It is a healthy male tiger which is about 7-years-old,"" a zoo official said. 
   Zoo staff had earlier reported the presence of a wild tiger in the forest adjacent to the zoo. “We had also got pug marks of a feline near lion and tiger safari areas,” said another official. 
   According to the chief conservator of forest (wildlife), J D Sharma, the tiger might have sneaked into Nandankanan Sanctuary area from Satkosia Tiger Reserve. 
   Asked about the next course of action, Sharma said they would draw the attention of the National Zoo Authority and National Tiger Conservation Authority regarding the tiger’s rehabilitation. ""We do not know whether the tiger will remain in Nandankanan. Presently, it is inside the tiger safari,""
 Panda said.
