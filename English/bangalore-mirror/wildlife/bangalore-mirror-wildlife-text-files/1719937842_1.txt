Ahead of the trailer launch on Wednesday (March 6), the makers of Junglee released a poster that shows the bond between man and animal at a time when the human-animal conflict is raising concerns all over the world.

The poster is incredibly unique as it shows the bond between an elephant and his human friend. The film stars Vidyut Jammwal as Raja, a veterinarian and elephant whisperer who returns to his father's wildlife reserve and finds out that poachers are targeting his four-legged friends. He then takes on the mantle of protecting them. His closest friend in this endeavour is an elephant named Bhola. The poster focuses on Vidyut’s arm intertwined with an elephant trunk. Vidyut's fist is clenched in a show of strength as several poachers approach them with their guns drawn against the backdrop of a jungle. The poster effectively showcases the loyalty and bond between Raj and Bhola.

While releasing the poster, Junglee Pictures, which is producing the film, also teased the trailer that will be released tomorrow (March 6). “Raj aur Bhola, inn dono ki dosti hi kuch anokhi hai, suniye yeh kahaani unhi ki zubaani! #JungleeTrailerTomorrow,” they tweeted.

A few hours before the launch of the poster, Junglee Pictures also shared a promo teaser that shows Vidyut fighting poachers in the dark with sticks of fire. If the teaser is anything to go by, the full trailer -- and the movie -- promise to be an exciting, action-packed one.

          
The film also stars Pooja Sawant and Asha Bhat. The three of them visited Siddhivanayak temple on Monday to seek Lord Ganesha’s blessings. 

Junglee is a family-action film directed by Chuck Russell. Produced by Vineet Jain and co-produced by Priti Shahani, the film is set to release in cinemas on 5th April 2019.
