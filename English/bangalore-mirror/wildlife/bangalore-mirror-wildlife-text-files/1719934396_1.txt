In a rare procedure, a turtle had its shell, which was broken when a vehicle ran over it, rejoined by the BBMP forest cell volunteers. The Indian Black Turtle's shell was rejoined using an adhesive prepared with chemicals imported from the US as they are not available in the country.
 The turtle, which belongs to the pond terrapin (melanochelys trijuga) species, was injured in JP Nagar last week when a motorbike ran over it and broke its shell.
 
 Sharath R Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, said the broken shell parts were rejoined and placed on the turtle’s back. A fibre mesh was placed on the shell and special glue smeared on it. “The procedure will help rejoin the severed parts of the shell,” he said. Babu said the turtle will be normal once the broken part becomes functional.
 
 “The shell protects the turtle. If the broken shell is not rejoined, it might harm its internal organs, especially intestine, and pose a threat to its life,” said Shreeram Narahari, a volunteer.
 
 EXPENSIVE GLUE
 
 Interestingly, the glue used in the procedure is very expensive. According to the forest cell volunteers, a gram of a mixture of two chemicals, including the epoxy resin used for making the glue to rejoin the shell, costs Rs 2,500 to Rs 2,800. About 20 ml of glue was used for the purpose.
 
 Babu said: “It will take two weeks for the turtle to return to normal. It will be released once the parts are rejoined and its blood circulation is normal.”
