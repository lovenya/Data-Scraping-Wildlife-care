The Garvebavi Palya Lake may yet be saved. The “property” was up for “sale” for around Rs 400 crore (BM broke the story: ‘This is a lake, and it’s up for sale’). The Bommanahalli MLA, in whose jurisdiction the lake falls, has stood up to save this lake, along with some wildlife activists. 
 
 “The family (which claims ownership) managed to get a court order in its favour as our officials didn’t produce the needed documents to the court. I collected the required documents and met speaker KB Koliwad and explained to him about the case. He officially ordered an enquiry. I also called officials who are connected to it and spoke to them. Then, I met the deputy commissioner of Bangalore Urban district V Shankar. According to our maps, it is still a lake.
 
 “I will never let land sharks gobble up the lake. A compound wall will be built soon. I have also demanded a criminal case against the people who are trying to sell this water body,” Reddy said.
 
 The case came to light after environment advisor to BBMP Sharath Babu complained about the “sale” to Koliwad.
