Fifteen kilograms of reef building corals worth Rs 25 lakh and four rose-ringed parrots worth Rs 1.4 lakh were seized in a joint operation by the Railway police and the special task force of the Forest department here on Monday.

The items were found in parcels booked in Bangalore railway station. Officials caught red-handed two international wildlife smugglers, Sathamani Devadutt from Tirchi and Rafi Ahmed Khan from Mysore, in this connection. The duo had booked parcels to Mysore on train and packed corals and parrots into it. Police are grilling the accused for more information about their international wildlife poaching ring.

Rose-ringed parrots are supposed to be intelligent. They are very costly and usually purchased by the rich.
