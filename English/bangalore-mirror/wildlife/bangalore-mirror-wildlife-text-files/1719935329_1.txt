The forest mobile squad has seized 80 kilograms of elephant bones and arrested a person who was trying to sell them. 

 According to the squad’s sleuths, Madhu H B, a 30-year-old resident of Sakleshpur, was trying to sell the bones in Whitefield when he was caught red-handed on Saturday. The bones are from the ribs and thighs of an adult elephant. Sale of elephant bones is banned under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 

 Deputy conservator of forests N D Sudarshan told Bangalore Mirror, “It is a serious offence. A person is not supposed to possess any wildlife product for more than 24 hours. He/she should bring it to the notice of the forest department within 24 hours.” A case has been booked and investigation is on to ascertain if the bones came from elephant poaching, rampant along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. Madhu reportedly was in possession of the bones for the last three years. He claims that he got the bones by exhuming the body of a female elephant, which was electrocuted and buried in Eslur range of Sakleshpur. 

 	The squad is working with Sakleshpur range forest team to check forest records to ascertain if any female elephant was indeed electrocuted and buried in Eslur forest. 

 	Madhu has been booked under various sections of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, for hunting, entering a reserve forest, possession, and trying to sell wildlife products. If found guilty, he could be imprisoned for six years.
