Panicked by the presence of bear and venting their ire against the callous forest officials who failed to act on their complaint, more than 50 villagers attacked the bear, today, with stones and sticks almost killing the animal on the spot for no mistake of it!
 
 
 The gruesome episode of man-animal conflict took place at Uppanayakanahalli near Janukonda in Chitradurga taluk which is 250 kilometers from Bengaluru.
 
 
 The chasing spanning several hours was finally put to end with the intervention of forest officials. They successfully captured the bear and shifted to Adumalleshwara Zoo in Jogimatti Wildlife Sanctuary for further treatment.
 
 
 Malleshappa, a resident of the village said, “Villagers had seen the bear on Monday evening and complained to forest officials to capture it. Our repeated requests and calls to forest department were not answered and villagers had no option than to take on the bear to safeguard villagers. Had the forest department officials been vigilant and swung into action when alerted, the tragedy would not have happened.”
 
 
 Eye witnesses told BM that the bear had attacked a farmer and injured him severely. Venting their ire, villagers had almost beaten the bear to death. Forest officials laid trap and captured the bear.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chitradurga Rural Police Station Sub-Inspector Satish and few others who were deployed to control the mob had also sustained injuries due to attack by the bear.

 “Due to repeated hitting, the animals has sustained multiple injuries and treated by veterinarians. Currently it is put on intra-venous fluids and responding to the treatment. Luckily there are no fractures. As it was a violent mob, we could not identify anybody who attacked the bear to be booked under Wildlife Act,” Srinivas explained
