The Dora Kere located in Uttarahalli was once upon a time a haunt for bird-watchers, walkers, nature lovers and more. However over the years, the state of the lake has deteriorated to an extent that people have stopped visiting.

The lake has a walking and jogging pathway, many benches and a space for meditation. But after the pandemic struck, there was no maintenance and the downpour in the past few months have made the situation worse, with sewage flowing into the lake. The sewage treatment plant (STP) near the lake has been dysfunctional.

Regular walkers pointed out that the lake was rich in biodiversity and over 110 species of birds have been spotted in the last seven years. Some of the species like egrets, brahminy kites and cormorants, ibises have been spotted.
 
Raghvendra B Pacchapur from action Aid Association said, “Presently the lake water is in algal bloom stage. Growth of algae in water is due to heavy intake of nutrients in the form of sewage. BBMP should work out a bio-remedial measure to reduce the nutrient load in the water and make it wildlife/fish conducive.”

According to him among the several birds seen at the lake were two nearly threatened species - Oriental Darter and Black Headed Ibis. “Now the water quality is a serious concern and the soil has eroded under the culvert so it needs repair. The wetland is filled wih sludge and needs to be cleared.”

The residents pointed out that with heavy rains in July and August, and many localities getting flooded, the STP was stopped, after which it was not been made functional. So untreated sewage is flowing into the lake. “We are regular walkers here but now due to the stench, we cannot even visit the lake. The lake water has even become a breeding ground for the mosquitoes. The civic body is not doing anything about it,” said a resident of Uttarahalli KS Jayram.

Another resident pointed out that dry waste is also being dumped in to the lake.
