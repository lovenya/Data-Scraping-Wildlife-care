In a major catch, wildlife sleuths have seized 60 horns, weighing 30kg, of spotted deer from a BBMP employee and his two accomplices on Friday.    The BBMP waterman, Vajramuni, was caught red-handed while trying to sell the horns. His associates, however, were arrested later in an undercover operation carried out by the city’s forest mobile squad.   The mobile squad sleuths, based on a tip off, carried out an undercover operation and met the gang as purchasers. Vajramuni was caught while negotiating to sell the horns at Rs 10,000 per kg. However, before he could sell he fell in the trap laid by the forest mobile squad.   The seizure came as a surprise to the police as what they thought to be a couple of horns turned out to be 60 of them. “This is one of the major recoveries. The seized horns are genuine,” a senior official told Bangalore Mirror. Police suspect there is a bigger gang behind this. According to the official, the sleuths are now trying to find the modus oparandi of the gang.    The accused will be tried under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act.
