After the mining issue, it is the night safari project at the Bannerghatta Biological Park which is the bone of contention between the two camps.

Reacting to forest minister C H Vijayashankar’s objection to the project, tourism minister G Janardhana Reddy said on Monday he would go ahead with the project ‘at any cost’. Reddy, who was taking part in World Tourism day celebrations, said, “The tourism department is committed to implementing the project, regardless of the obstacles. Further, once implemented it would be the first of its kind in the country.”

 Commenting on the forest minister’s objection to the night safari, Reddy said, “He may not have been properly briefed about the project. In fact, this was the pet project of the chief minister and I have taken it further with his consent. I will approach the minister through the chief minister. The safari will have arrangements like lighting resembling moonlight and taped sounds of wildlife.”

However, forest minister Vijayashankar, a staunch supporter of the chief minister, is unfazed. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror soon after a review meeting of his department, he said, “I do not know what he has said. But I stand by my statement. I will also convince the minister about the impact of a night safari on the wild animals.”
