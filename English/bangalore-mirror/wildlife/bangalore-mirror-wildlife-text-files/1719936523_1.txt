The long weekends have sent the city residents into a tizzy planning trips to different part of the state and the most favoured among them is jungle tourism. But it is not good news for the forest department because the sudden spurt in the number of tourists is bad news for wildlife.
 
 Popular tourism destinations like Nagarhole National park, Bandipur Tiger reserve and forest areas like Dandeli and Masinagudi including the ecologically sensitive western-ghats are littered with trash once tourists end their vacation.
 
 A senior forest officer at Nagarhole Tiger reserve said, “Despite putting the members of the anti-poaching camp on vigil, there are many people who tend to litter in the ecologically sensitive area. We have taken all precautionary measures to avert littering, but at times when our staff are out for lunch or are on rounds, people throw garbage inside the reserved area.”
 
 In the month of February, when volunteers of Bangalore Trekking club carried out a cleaning drive at Skandagiri near the city, around 800 kg of trash was collected out of which 500 kg of beer bottles were found. A volunteer said people have turned so insensitive towards the environment that they litter mindlessly.
 
 Sharath B, a conservationist, said, “It is high time the state government takes some stringent action to stop such activities. Recently, a few animals were killed in the forest after ingesting plastic." BMB
