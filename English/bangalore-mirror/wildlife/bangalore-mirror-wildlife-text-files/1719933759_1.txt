With the lights off and homes lit by candles, Earth Hour was a success this year in Bangalore. If not in terms of awareness about climate change, at least in terms of energy savings. In fact, the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) saved 194 Mega Watts (MW) of energy in just one hour!

Bescom participated in World Earth Hour for the first time and requested its customers to turn off lights at homes and offices for an hour on March 28 between 8.30 pm and 9.30 pm. The Earth Hour is a World Wildlife Fund initiative and was observed throughout the world. Speaking about the power savings, H Nagesh, Director Technical, Bescom, said “We have saved lot of power during Earth Hour. If people start observing earth hour more often, then we could save more energy.”

During the Earth Hour, lights on shops and hotels at major streets like M G Road and Brigade Road were turned off. Even government offices observed a black out. “We turned off lights at Vidhana Soudha and Vikasa Soudha which has saved us 450 units of power”, he said.

On a normal day, the city consumes 1,400 MW to 1,500 MW of power. With load shedding in place, this had also come down.
