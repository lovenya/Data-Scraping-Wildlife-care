Bannerghatta Biological Park’s (BBP) animal adoption programme got a boost on Sunday with Rajya Sabha MP from Bangalore, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, adopting 31 different animals including a recently-born Asiatic elephant and a Royal Bengal tiger. Chandrasekhar along with his wife and children adopted lions, elephant, tiger, leopard, Indian rock python, spoonbill, lovebirds, Malabar giant squirrel and other animals for a year.  
  At a simple function held at BBP, Chandrasekhar handed over a cheque of Rs 6.89 lakh to forest minister C P Yogeshwar. “We are delighted to be part of this initiative and contribute to the well being of these lovely animals and birds and encourage wildlife conservation,” Chandrasekhar said.
