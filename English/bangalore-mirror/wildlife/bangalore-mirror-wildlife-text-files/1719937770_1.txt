Four aid workers have been convicted on charges connected to their efforts to leave food and water for migrants in an Arizona wildlife refuge along the US-Mexico border.

The volunteers, who are members of the faith-based humanitarian aid group No More Deaths, were caught on August 13, 2017, by a federal wildlife officer as they left water jugs, beans and other supplies for migrants in Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which shares an 80-km border with Mexico. 

The judge, Magistrate Bernardo P Velasco, ruled last week that three of the volunteers-Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse and Zaachila Orozco-McCormick-were convicted of entering a national wildlife refuge without a permit and abandoning personal property or possessions. A fourth volunteer, Natalie Hoffman, was convicted on an additional charge of operating a motor vehicle in a wilderness area. Each of the volunteers faces up to six months in prison.

The decision is the first conviction against humanitarian aid volunteers in a decade.
