"By announcing the reward I mean to say that assaults on wildlife are as heinous as attacks on humans. All are equal in nature," Srinivasan said.

Srinivasan wants that all the culprits should be given the maximum punishment and should be named and shamed in public. He informed that several netizens have responded to his tweet and have come forward to offer similar rewards for the tip off that helps bring the culprits to book.

Srinivasan is also general secretary of United Federation of Resident Welfare Associations in Greater Hyderabad.
