 Bengalureans, heading to ring in New Year near wildlife reserves in and around Mysuru, have bad news in store. Authorities have decided to ban “high-voltage parties” in hotels and pubs close to national parks and bird sanctuaries. It’s learnt the forest department has even banned playing loud music in such places.
 
 “Playing out loud music during New Year celebrations in resorts, hotels, pubs are common. More people prefer partying on the outskirts of the city. Now forest department has strictly ordered not to play loud music at six wildlife and bird sanctuaries which comes under Mysuru zone,” a source said.
 
 Confirming the move, Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) V Yedukundala said, “We have got many complaints about youths playing loud music and hosting parties near national parks. Also hotels and resorts are giving permission for late-night parties which could cause damage to wildlife, flora and fauna. So we have strictly instructed hotels and resorts not to allow parties. Places like KRS backwaters, Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary have become a regular spot for party-goers. Special patrolling will be done on New Year. We will take action against those who don’t follow orders.”
 
 Violators will be booked under Wildlife Act.
