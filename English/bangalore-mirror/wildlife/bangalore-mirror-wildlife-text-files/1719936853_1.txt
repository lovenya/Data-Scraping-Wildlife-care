 The state is witnessing a spate of tiger deaths with its 12th tiger being found dead.
 
 
 
 
 
 A 12-year-old male tiger was found dead in Kundhakere range of Bandipur Tiger Reserve on Sunday. With this death, concerns are being raised over serious shortage of water. This is the second tiger death in the recent past in Bandipur range. “It died due to natural causes as the tiger was already 12 years old,” said T Heeralal, director, National Tiger Conservator Authority.
 
 Asked if shortage of water was leading to deaths of tigers in the state, he said, “I am not supposed to talk about all this. I can say there is natural process in the world of wildlife. Rain may be delayed now, but it will pour in two months, and hence the shortage of water cannot be grounds for tiger deaths.”
 
 However, some argue that tiger deaths are increasing this year due to shortage of water and food. Recently, while a one-year-old tiger was stranded and rescued later near Nagarahole tiger reserve, experts opined that the tiger had entered an urban area in search of food. Of the 12 dead tigers, two died due to overdose of tranquiliser, 2 were due to injuries by snare, one died due to poisoning, 2 died due to infighting and one cub died due to natural causes.
 
 While in January four tigers died in the same week, the jinx continued in February as well with another four tigers dying in just 21 days.
 
 The deaths were reported from DG Kuppa, Muliyaru, Kabini, Ponnampet, Kallu, Srimangala and Bandipur.
