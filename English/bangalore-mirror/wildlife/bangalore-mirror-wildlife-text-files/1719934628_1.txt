For one little snakebird, it was a flight to freedom and a fresh lease of life. The bird, which was rescued from the jaws of death and nursed back to health by BBMP wildlife wardens, was released on Tuesday. The fledgling had fallen from a silver oak tree, a fall of about 50 feet. The bird’s neck had been impaled and there was little hope for survival. 
 
   “Two birds had fallen from the nest, but the other one succumbed to injuries and died on the very first night after it was rescued,” said Sree Ram, a BBMP wildlife volunteer. 
   Darters or snake birds (called so because of its snake-like neck) are rarely found in the city, so when the wildlife cell was alerted to the injured birds , they knew it was a distress call. 
   “It began with a phone call,” said Sharat Babu, wildlife warden. “There is a park behind the Mico Layout Police station close to the Madivala Lake where snakebirds nest. This lady had noticed the two birds on the ground. and immediately called us.”
   What followed was a fortnight of hide-and-seek with death as the bird struggled with its injuries.
   “Since the neck had been impaled, we had to close the wound through surgery. Even then it was very difficult for him to retain food,” said Sree Ram.
 
 The rescuers, however, did not give in and continued to hand-feed the bird. Finally after 15 days of round-the-clock care, the bird began to show signs of improvement.
   “He wanted to fly, so when the stitches were finally removed, we took him back on Tuesday and released him in the park where he was found. He took off happily,” Sree Ram said. 
   As the volunteers celebrated, they could not help but remember the lady who had first alerted them to the plight of the birds. 
   “Had it not been for her presence of the mind, we would not have been able to save the bird. Thank god for citizens like her,” said Sree Ram as he watched the bird take flight.
