‘Age appropriate’ questions
Is there any correlation between age and questions? A lot, going by Housing Minister V Somanna. The BJP MLA from Govindarajanagar has been in the news for rumours floating of him allegedly switching sides. When journalists sought to know his views, he shot back, saying, “This question is not appropriate for my age. Instead, ask me only those questions which suit my age and experience.”

Health factor
National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) project director BT Sridhar has been facing a volley of questions from all quarters over chaos at toll booths in the Mysuru expressway. When Sridhar was questioned about why he was not answering calls for clarification, he surprised everyone saying that he had been ill. “When I was leaving my home in Mysuru, I had severe chest pain. I had to head out to a hospital for ECG and check my blood pressure. I have a lot of limitations and am unable to answer 500 calls every day,” he said.

Feathers ruffled

As the election scene heats up, leaders are vying to get unique garlands. Garlands are being made out of unique things from capsicum to pineapple. However, farmer leader Darshan Puttannaiah was in a soup recently when he received a garland made out of peacock feathers. As soon as the news went viral on social media, forest department officials jumped into action and issued notices to those who offered those garlands as it violated the wildlife act.

Selfie trouble
An examination invigilator was in a pickle when she clicked a selfie in an exam hall during the ongoing PU exams. As the news went viral, the education department officials sought to take action against her as she took a selfie in the exam centre when students were busy writing their tests. Mobile phones are also banned in the exam hall. However, the invigilator said that she wanted to click a selfie to document that everything was running smoothly in the exam hall.
