Visitors must get a check-in sticker and pay Rs 10 for each plastic item they carry into the park

Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) has taken one more step towards being plastic-free. The park authorities recently framed new rules for visitors to minimise plastic use within the park. 

“We have not banned any kind of plastic into Bannerghatta Biological Park. People who enter park will be checked at the entrance gate. All plastic, like water bottles or so, will be identified with a park sticker. We will charge Rs 10 for each plastic item,” said a senior BBP official.

“We have had many people coming up with innovative ways to reduce plastic use in the park. Right from trying to upscale plastic and use it as a construction material to giving free cloth bags to shops in the vicinity, environmentalists were leaving no stone unturned to make the park as plastic-free as possible,” he added.

The park authorities had been concerned about the damage done to wildlife and park ecology by indiscriminate dumping of plastic waste in the park by visitors. Till recently, visitors were requested to throw used plastic bottles into collection tubs in the park. But many visitors would ignore the instruction and would add to the plastic waste in the park. “The best plan is to make the park an entirely plastic-free zone. Most people do not follow the instructions and do throw used plastic bags or bottles in the park. This new rule could make the park cleaner,” said Sandeep R, a visitor to BBP.

“We were not sure of public reaction, but we have succeeded in implementing the rule for some time now. There has been a good response to the cleanliness initiatives. We are also offering free toilet service now, with the additional money collected,”said R Gokul, Executive Director of BBP.

Ahead of the World Environment Day on June 5, the park had also banned plastics in all protected areas around the park, creating plastic free zones.
