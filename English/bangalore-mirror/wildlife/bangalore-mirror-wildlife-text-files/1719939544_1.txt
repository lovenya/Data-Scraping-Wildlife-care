As Tiger Census report to be out today, all eyes on State that once had most tigers

The latest Tiger Census report that will be out on Sunday will reveal if Karnataka can regain its top spot with the maximum number of big cats. For decades, Karnataka had the highest number of tigers, but as per the 2018 tiger census, Madhya Pradesh had 526 big cats while Karnataka had 524.

As per the 2018 data, there were 386 tigers in the reserves with Bandipur having the highest number (173), followed by Nagarahole (164), Biligiri Rangaswamy temple reserve (86), Bhadra (38) and Anshi (11).

Union Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ashwini Kumar Choubey said, “The quadrennial All India Tiger Estimation Exercise uses robust scientific methodology to assess the status of tigers, co-predators, and prey in India. The latest estimation done in 2018 showed an increase in the tiger population with an estimated number of 2,967 (range 2,603-3,346) compared to the 2014 estimation of 2,226 (range 1,945-2,491).”

The average lifespan of tigers in the wild is generally 10-12 years, and factors like old age, diseases, internecine fights, electrocution, snaring, drowning, road and rail hits, etc., and a very high infant mortality observed in big cats account for the majority of tiger deaths.

The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India have published documents to safeguard wildlife and tigers from road/rail accidents in interlinking/corridor areas. Thirty-two major tiger corridors in the country have been identified.

Top tiger habitat

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Project Tiger, the focus is on Bandipur Project Tiger Reserve, recognised as the prime tiger habitat in the world today, where the project was born in 1973. The number of tigers at that time was only 12; as per records, the number has gone up to 126 in India as of 2018.
 
Bandipur National Park was formed by including most of the forest area of the then Venugopala Wildlife Park established by the government in 1941. It was brought under Project Tiger in 1973, with adjacent reserve forest areas added to extend it to 880.02 sq km, and the present area under the reserve is 912.04 sq km. The reserve is home to the highest number of tigers in the country.
