Kannada actress Samyukta Hornad visited the Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre run by Wildlife SOS in Bengaluru recently to extend her support for the organisation.

She toured the facility, interacted with the veterinarians and staff, and helped the keepers feed the bears. The Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre houses 77 rescued bears at the moment, making it the world’s second largest rescue centre for sloth bears. “We have and will continue to work towards protecting wild sloth bears that are a constant target of human exploitation,” said Dr Arun. A. Sha Director-Research and Veterinary Operations, Wildlife SOS.

Samyukta Hornad was moved after her experience at the centre. “I am so happy to see that there is such a place in India for rescued animals. I wish more people volunteer and do their bit for these bears,” she said

Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS, said “It’s very reassuring to see an actor like Samyukta Hornad lend her support to the cause of sloth bear protection. This will help spread a message about the need for conservation and wildlife protection.”

The Bengaluru-based actress has pledged her support to spread awareness about sloth bears in India.
