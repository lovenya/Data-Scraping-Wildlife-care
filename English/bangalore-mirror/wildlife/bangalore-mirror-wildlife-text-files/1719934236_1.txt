Here’s a family who live with an emu. From washing in the bath to joining in at mealtimes, Beaky loves to be a part of home life.
 
 When the six Newby children sit to watch television, their feathered ‘big sister’ will barge into the living room to watch her favourite shows – wildlife programmes, naturally.
 
 But her size (90kg) and diet (large portions of broccoli and cauliflower) mean it’s better at night for her to be banished to a summerhouse in the garden of their house in Little Wakering.
 
 Beaky was given to Iain Newby, 44, as an egg for a Christmas present by his wife two-and-a-half years ago. He made a makeshift egg incubator, but didn’t think it would hatch. It did. 
 
 As they all grew up together, Newby’s children – Jack, seven, Harry, six, Bryce, five, George, three, Peter, two, and Joe, ten months – all feel that Beaky is like a sister to them. But Newby doesn’t recommend the pet to everyone.
