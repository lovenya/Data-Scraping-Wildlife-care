Bangalore is set to get the country’s first urban forest on Wednesday. The forest, which will be opened in Turalli on Kanakapura Road, will give Bangaloreans the feel of a real forest. The forest aims at creating an ‘oxygen reserve’ and restoring the city’s lost green cover.
 
 The forest will also educate the people on urban wildlife and varied native tree species with innovative parks such as ‘Rashi Vana’ and ‘Navagraha Vana’ based on sun signs and the nine planets. “This is the first time in the country a city is getting an urban forest,” said S Kumaraswamy, deputy conservator of forest, Bangalore Urban.
 
 The forest has come up on a 597-acre area in Turalli, which is a mini reserveforest. It is being developed at a cost of Rs 5 crore with more than 1,000 saplings of native species being planted there.
 
 The forest will also be home to some urban wildlife. It will also have small, medium and old trees. A walker’s track too is being created on a one-acre area within the forest.
 
 The forest aims at educating Bangaloreans on the native species of trees and urban wildlife and birds. Over 61 species of urban wildlife, including mongoose, reptiles, birds and mammals are being released and protected here.
 
 This will be among the 11 urban forests coming up across the state. The city will get three more forests and they would be ready in the next three years. “It’s a welcome step that urban forests are coming up in cities,” said Sharath Babu R, honorary chief wildlife warden, Bangalore. “This will increase green cover and provide a safe habitat for urban wildlife.”
