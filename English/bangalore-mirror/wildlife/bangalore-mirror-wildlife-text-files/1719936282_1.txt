Of the 17 parakeets rescued, 14 are hale and hearty thanks to Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre’s (WRRC) relentless care. The chicks, rescued from an illegal pet trade, have graduated from their carriers to move
 into aviaries.
 
 Bangalore Mirror had reported the plight of the rescued babies in its report, ‘17 smuggled parakeets: rescued, not yet saved’, on Jan 22.
 
 Saving the baby birds that were very sensitive and prone to diseases was a challenge for their caretakers at the WRRC. Besides round-the-clock care, WRRC had also appealed for help as arranging for their food turned out to be a challenge.
 
 Help came from the BM readers as word spread. Donors pitched in Rs 50,000 in cash and 20 kg of baby bird formula (worth around Rs 30,000), and this came in handy, explained the WRRC brass.
 
 “Some of these donations came from compassionate wildlife-lovers outside Bangalore. The babies are still being hand-fed, but we are transitioning them to the adult bird diets of nuts, fruit and seeds,” Anand Jacob, a managing committee member at WRRC, told Bangalore Mirror, in an email. He said the birds have been vaccinated against Newcastle Disease Virus, one of the biggest dangers to young birds. “When their flight muscles have developed, they will be able to practice their flying skills,” Jacob added.
 
 However, three chicks succumbed to respiratory infection. This is not unusual since the birds were separated from their parents far too young, before they developed natural immunity to infections, an official said.
 
 The 17 chicks were among 29 birds, that included adults, rescued by the city police during an interception while being transported by poachers from Chennai to Mysuru, on January 19. Subsequently, they were sent to WRRC as part of rehabilitation. The birds are listed under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. Sources said the parakeets were likely to be released back into the wild habitats once they were fit to fly and feed on their own
