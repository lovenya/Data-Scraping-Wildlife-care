Her nest in ruins and with little protection from Monday night’s downpour, a pariah kite staged a soul-stirring battle to protect her two chicks until wildlife rescuers gave her a helping hand. Rescuers say mother and chicks, which are three to four weeks old, are doing fine.  
 The kite’s woes began when a Bescom transformer burst at Palace Guttalli, close to North Wind bar. The blast, coupled with the rain, uprooted a nearby coconut tree in which the kite nested. Luckily for the kite and her young ones, the tree fell on a compound wall of a house. It broke the impact, but still there was enough to send one of the chicks crashing to the ground. The chick wasn’t hurt in the fall, but the mother was, quite literally, torn between her young. She decided to stay with the one stuck in the fronds of the tree while keeping a close watch on the one on the ground.  
 Twenty minutes after the tree fell, a BBMP team, in response to calls from residents, arrived to clear the tree. As the workers began clearing the branches, the mother kite flew to the chick on the ground and spread her wings over it, refusing to allow workers to go near it. It was then that the BBMP workers noticed the remains of the nest and the other chick stuck in the tree. They immediately called wildlife volunteers.  
 “It was a heart-stirring scene and quite different from our usual rescues,” Rajesh S, the wildlife volunteer who rescued the three birds, said. “She kept watch over her young ones in the lashing rains. It was touching. Thankfully, the mother and her babies are safe now.”
