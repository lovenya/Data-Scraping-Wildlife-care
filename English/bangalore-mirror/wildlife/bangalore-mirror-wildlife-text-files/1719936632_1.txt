The Christian Medical College (CMC) in Vellore has decided to suspend four medicos who allegedly tortured and killed a female bonnet macaque recently.
 
 After the monkey reportedly strayed into the hostel room on November 19, the four students caught the monkey with a blanket, took it to the terrace, tied it up, beat the primate with sticks and belts then thrust a rod into its anus and killed it, sources said.
 
 "They brutally attacked the monkey after tying its neck. They inserted a rod through the anus and tore out the entire digestive system. An eye was also gouged out," a wildlife conservationist Nishanth Ravi told Mirror.
 
 It has been stated that other students contacted a Mumbai-based animal activist who tipped off activists in Chennai on November 21.
 
 Upon information the hostel authorities suspended the students and informed the college authorities. Activists lodged a police complaint after which Bagayam police on Monday registered a case under Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle etc) of the Indian Penal Code and under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.
 
 The carcass of the monkey was exhumed from behind the canteen of the men's hostel. The monkey reportedly had multiple fractures. Its hands were tied behind its back, a telephone cord tied around its neck and a sharp object was inserted into the anus.
 
 Meanwhile the college has instituted an inquiry committee and a report was submitted.
