Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Forest Department has filed a chargesheet against Malayalam superstar Mohanlal in the case relating to illegal possession of ivory.

Sources in the department told Mirror that the chargessheet was filed against the actor and three others at a Judicial First Class Magistrate Court in Perumbavoor early this week.

Also arraigned as accused in the case are PN Krishnakumar of Olloor, K Radhakrishnan of Thripunithura and Nalini Radhakrishnan of Chennai.

The chargesheet was filed after reportedly the Kerala High Court questioned the delay in the follow-up action in the case. The alleged offence was committed in 2011.

The incident first came to light after forest officials raided the house of the actor at Thevara in Ernakulam district and seized two pairs of elephant tusks.

It is understood that though the forest department initially registered a case against Mohanlal, it was later quashed. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests granted the ownership certificate of the elephant tusks to Mohanlal.

Following this, a native of Ernakulam A APoulose moved the High Court seeking to quash the order granting the ownership certificate of the elephant tusks to Mohanlal.

Meanwhile, recently the Kerala government submitted before the High Court that it did not approve the decision of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to allow the actor to retain the elephant tusks.

The offence, under the Wildlife Protection Act, for which the actor and three others were charged are reportedly punishable with imprisonment up to seven years along with fine, say sources.
