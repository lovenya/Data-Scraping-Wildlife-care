In a big blow to wildlife conservation in the state, a wild gaur weighing around 600 kg was killed on the Belgaum-Chorla state highway when a speeding bike rammed into it on Sunday night. 

 	While the endangered herbivore, also known as the Indian bison, died on the spot, the two youths -- Anil Patel, 24, and Ankush Patil, 22 -- who were on the bike are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Belgaum where their condition is said to be critical. 

 	The incident took place around 7:30 pm near Betne village in Kanakumbi range, which falls under the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary. The sanctuary has a high density of gaurs. 

 	Police and forest officials have registered a case against the men as the gaur is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. 

 	Forest officials suspect that the gaur was running on the road because it was being chased by a leopard. The two bikers failed to notice the gaur which was heading their way. 

 	Patel has reportedly sustained 15 stitches. Investigations are on to ascertain whether the two men were over-speeding or drunk. 

 	“The gaur sustained injuries on its skull and died on the spot. The bike has also been badly damaged,” a forest official of Kanakumbi range, Belgaum Division, told Bangalore Mirror. 

 	Meantime, wildlife activists have called for urgent measures to prevent wildlife deaths. They blamed Sunday's accident on the absence of proper signage and measures to regulate over-speeding vehicles on the highways. 

 	“There are hardly any signboards or speed breakers to check speeding vehicles. Hence the lives of both humans and wildlife on these highways are at stake. The government must enforce restrictions on the movement of vehicles or completely ban night-time traffic within protected areas,” said Giridhar Kulkarni, a wildlife activist.
