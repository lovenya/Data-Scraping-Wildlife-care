No security or compound wall is reason for littering: Volunteers

Around eighty bags of trash were collected from Mylasandra Lake in Turahalli Forest range on Tuesday morning by 50 volunteers who had come together to execute the project 'Swachcha Vana', an initiative to clear up forests and lakes of trash. Rajesh Kumar, a Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) verified wildlife rescuer who initiated the project says, “Most of the trash consisted of liquor bottles, cigarette butts as the lake has no proper security and compound wall to secure it, due to which people frequent it at all times of the day and litter here. We also collected plastic covers among other hazardous waste. We found that there were no signboards warning people not to litter at the lake. We sent the collected waste to a recycle unit.”

The group also borrowed a coracle, (small boat) from the fishermen to venture inside the lake to clear the plastic waste floating in the water. 

The group further plans to clean up other lakes and forests in the city with each drive. Kumar adds, “Through the coracle, we could reach the highlands and picked up the plastic waste that had been deposited there. We will also be requesting the Palike to make several changes at the lake to secure it from trespassers after sunset and help put up proper signboards as well.”
