The 1,100-acre Jananbharati Campus of the Bangalore University is turning into a huge garbage dumpyard. Hundreds of people from nearby areas, who visit the campus for early morning walks and jogging, do not think twice about throwing garbage here. 

 	On Sunday morning, a group of around 30 joggers arrived at the campus armed with gloves, masks, bags and a tempo. In one hour, the volunteers of a group calling themselves Jnananbharati Vayuviharigala Sangha (Jnanabharati Walkers Association) collected nearly 30 bags of garbage, mostly bottles, plastic bags and papers. 

 	Murugendra Kumar, a Toyota employee and one of the youngest members of the group, said, “We are all regular walkers in the campus. We have been noticing that some walkers were littering the campus. Since six months, some of the regulars were discussing ways to tackle this issue. After various suggestions, it was decided to take up the task of clearing the garbage. Today (Sunday) over 30 people including family members of some walkers collected around 30 bags of garbage. We managed to cover only one road. We have decided to do this every third Sunday.” 

 	Advocate Surya Mukundaraj, a new member of the group, said, “The campus is home to some wildlife, including peacocks. The garbage directly affects these animals. The garbage problem would have continued to grow and someone had to take action. It is nice to know that the walkers themselves have come together to address it. If more people think in the same direction, the campus will become a model.”
