A leopard got killed by an elephant herd on Sunday morning at Malbazar, Jalpaiguri after it was chasing a baby elephant from the herd.

According to sources, a leopard was hiding in Betguri tea garden from where a herd of elephants was passing. The leopard stealthily tried preying on an elephant calf, which got spotted by the head of the elephant herd. The tusker gave a chase to the big cat, that started running in the bushes.

The leopard, in order to save itself, climbed a tree, but the angry tusker uprooted the tree using its trunk. The leopard tried to run away, but the elephant wrapped it in its trunk and swirled the cat high up in the air. The leopard couldn't survive the fall.

Forest officials are investigating the matter. "It's possible for a tusker to uproot a tree. It is also difficult to judge the behaviour of a wild animal," said Animesh Basu, member of state's wildlife advisory board.

He further said that forest officials are waiting for the autopsy report of the leopard and will not completely go by the version of the villagers.
