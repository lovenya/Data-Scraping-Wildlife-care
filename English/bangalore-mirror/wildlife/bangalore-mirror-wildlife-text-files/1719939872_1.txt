Experts recommend establishing quiet havens, introducing anxiety wraps, maintaining soothing presence for dogs amid Deepawali fireworks

As the festive season of Deepawali approaches, synonymous with joy and celebration, it’s crucial to recognise the stress and anxiety it can bring to our four-legged friends, both domestic and stray. The explosive sounds of fireworks and firecrackers that light up the night sky might dazzle us, but they can be a source of profound distress for dogs.

Animal activists and veterinarians have suggested steps for pet owners and others to help dogs, both at home and on the streets, cope with the challenges of Deepawali, emphasizing that providing a comfortable space for them during the festivities is paramount.

Dr Navaz Shariff from the People for Animals Wildlife Hospital in Bangalore said, “Creating a designated area, be it a crate, a quiet room, or a cosy corner, equipped with blankets and pillows, can serve as a retreat for your dog. Playing calming music or white noise can help drown out the startling sounds of fireworks, offering a sense of security. Understanding the power of pheromones and using a diffuser emitting these natural chemicals can contribute to a more relaxed environment for your dog. Additionally, investing in a thunder shirt or anxiety wrap, which applies gentle pressure to the dog’s body, may alleviate stress.”

He further added, “A well-thought-out schedule, starting with a morning walk or playtime to tire out your dog, can set a positive tone for the day. This physical activity can help reduce anxiety and make your dog less reactive to noise later in the day. If stress does arise, maintaining a calm demeanour is crucial. Reassure your dog with a soothing voice and gentle petting, avoiding punishment for their natural reactions.” During Deepawali, experts have advised taking dogs for a long walk in the afternoon to establish a quiet haven complemented by calming music or white noise. In the evening, introduce a thunder shirt or anxiety wrap and a brief walk or play session before the fireworks commence. At night, if stress arises, maintain a calm and reassuring presence, employing a gentle touch and soothing words.

Dr Nawaz added, “If a dog exhibits signs of fear or anxiety, escort them to their safe space, speak to them in a calm and soothing manner, and offer a treat or toy as a comforting distraction. If shaking or trembling, provide gentle pets. For severe cases of anxiety, consulting with a veterinarian is recommended before considering medication. It’s essential to recognise each dog’s unique needs, as what works for one may not work for another.”

KB Harish, a rescuer, said, “We see a minimum of 15 cases reported for rescues every day. Other animal lovers, volunteers, and organizations handle another 30 cases in Bangalore. Animal lovers or residents should be cautious and keep an eye on strays while bursting crackers. Ensure that trash bins are securely closed to prevent animals from scavenging on harmful substances. Post-Deepawali, monitor your neighbourhood for distressed animals in the days following Deepawali and report any injuries or issues promptly.”
