A white deer, believed to be an Albino deer, was spotted at the Bogeshwar Camp of the Kakanakote Forest area of the Nagarhole National Tiger Reserve in DB Kuppe recently. According to forest officials, the staff spotted the white deer last Wednesday.
 
 Interestingly, it has not been spotted since then. Forest officials say it could be an Albino deer. Albinism is a congenital condition defined by the absence of pigment, resulting in an all-white appearance. Albino animals tend not to survive long because they have poor eyesight and are conspicuous, making them easy preys.
 
 According to a wildlife blog, one of the most persistent legends is that a hunter killing a white deer will experience a long run of bad luck. This belief seems almost universal among hunting cultures. Expert Peter Flack writes in his book Kudu that hunters across Africa believe misfortune will befall any hunter who kills a white antelope.
