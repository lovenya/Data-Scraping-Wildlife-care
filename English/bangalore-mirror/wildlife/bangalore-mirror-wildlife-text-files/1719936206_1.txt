Groundwork on the Network for Spectrum (NFS) project, which seeks to provide a dedicated communications network for the armed forces across the country, is all set to start in Karnataka. The state government has given a right of way (ROW) permission for installation of optical fibre cables across the state.
 
 	
 	A directive to this effect was issued to all the deputy conservators of forests of the territorial divisions to facilitate the laying of the cables. The directive states the cabling can be “carried out along the roads within the existing right of way not falling in the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, without felling of trees, where the maximum size of the trench is not more than two-metre-deep and one-metre-wide, subject to the conditions stipulated by the ministry of environment and forests.”
 	
 	  	In fact, the right of way was crucial to the NFS project as it eliminates possible objections in the form of litigations with regard to possible damage to the environment.
 	
 	
 	The directive describes the matter as something “pertaining to the national interest.”
 	
 	  	NFS was conceived after the defence forces vacated a part of their airwaves on August 31, 2010, following an assurance from the ministry of communications and IT for creating a network for the armed forces. The project allows the forces to migrate all their communication needs to this optical fibre network and free more bandwidth for commercial telephony services. 
 	
 	  	The project would connect 414 defence sites and access networks at 219 army sites. Of the many packages awarded to different contractors, Karnataka falls in the 7,154km range that includes Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Lakshadweep.
