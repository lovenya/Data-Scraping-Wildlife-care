Animal lovers have resolved to turn myth-busters in the new year, if it can bring some respite to the endangered species, traded and killed over superstitious beliefs
 
 	Spare a thought for the loris 	The slender loris is a small, nocturnal primate found only in the forests of south India and Sri Lanka. They have become a soft target and are being killed for their supposed medicinal or magical properties. The animals are brutally subjected to cruelty, and parts of their body are cut while performing sorcery. Being a soft target, they are being illegally hunted down, pushing them further towards extinction. It’s not clear how many slender lorises survive in the wild. They are listed under the Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972, according them the highest level of legal protection.
 	
 	 		Iridium doesn’t need this boa tale                                                                              	 		Red sand boas, also known as do-muha (two-headed) in local parlance because of the resemblance of its tail to its head, are rapidly being hunted down because of some prevalent myths.One myth having currency is that an isotope of iridium which fell on earth is being accumulated in the tissues of the red sand boa! As a result, this bio-iridium is supposed to give magical and supernatural properties to the animal. There’s another belief that the bio-iridium can act as a rice puller. Due to the prevalence of illegal trade, the red sand boas are hunt in large numbers and shockingly, even some very well educated people are said to be in the trade. 
 		
 		 			Bring back our sparrows                                                                                   		 			Unable to cope with the fast-paced urbanisation, sparrows are flying away from the city. A recent survey by BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society) found that Bangalore and Chennai have the least number of spots for sparrow sightings. Very few places in Bangalore have sparrows, which is a pointer to the wellbeing of the environment. They are found in Bangalore at Jayanagar, Basavangudi, Banashankari, Marathalli and in the outskirts. Conserving them is one of challenges in the year ahead. Though efforts are being carried out by a few NGOs in association with the BBMP forest cell, what‘s required is a civic body policy on sparrows. The city will then have sparrows left for future generations. Efforts by residents to draw them back will also help.  	 	 		
 		Indian turtles are being nailed
 		Turtles are being hunt down by those in the illegal wildlife trade. Traders even have a code name for them — 20 channel. They search for turtles with 20 nails as they are believed to bring luck to those who possess them. Though turtles have 16-18 nails, those in the trade search for turtles with 20 nails. One of the most sought after species in illegal trade, they are being hunt down, and are gradually being pushed into extinction. They need a helping hand in the year ahead.
 		
 		 			Leave the barn owl alone                          		 			Barn owls are again a soft target and are hunted down by those in the wildlife trade.
