You are combining theatre and photography in your workshop. Photography and theatre go hand in hand. As a photographer if you can judge a perfect emotion or expression then you can become a better shutterbug and theatre helps you to learn this. Imagine you are shooting a wildlife creature, spotting the right expression is a theatre technique. At our workshop, we will concentrate on basics of theatre and photography, once the basics are strong, the foundation is set for a bigger challenge. In our theatre workshop, we will use a technique called practical learning using games where we teach theatre using set of theatre games and exercises. We do not believe in theory classes.   You have called your workshop 'WeChitra' and WeNyaasa. Why and what does it mean? We, which means us, believe in Art for all. When we wanted to name our workshops we wanted to create a feeling of togetherness in it. While discussing ideas, one of our team members exclaimed our thoughts as “Wechitra (meaning strange in Kannada) and since chitra also represents photo, we instantly named our photography workshop as WeChitra. The crew put in their experiences and thoughts for theatre workshop and since together WeDesigned the workshop, we just converted design word to Kannada and we got WeNyaasa.   What can we learn at the workshop? We will shape you as a better, confident individual because here we don't preach nor teach, we create an environment where they apply their own creativity. Every person is creative, but we do not get the right platform to express and that is what these workshops will provide. Creativity can never be taught. We can only transform one's desire and passion and help them express.      To register, mail your registrations to info@wemovetheatre. On September 29-30 at Jaaga on Double Road.
