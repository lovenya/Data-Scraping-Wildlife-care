A team of researchers have found a more effective ‘statistical’ method of assessing the tiger population. Dr. Ullas Karanth, Director at Centre for Wildlife Studies, who was one of the four researchers in the study says, “The study uses camera trap images obtained during one of my researches in Nagarhole National Park. I am pleased that data from my 30-year intensive field study of tigers conducted in collaboration with Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), New York is now helping cutting-edge statistical developments.”

The process involves two methods - one is the process of animal arrival within a detection region, and the other is the process of recording this arrival by a given set of detectors. The study provides an accuracy in counting. Camera traps, devices that automatically trigger upon the presence of wildlife along forest trails, are extensively used in the census. Yet, camera traps do not work perfectly. When a pair of camera traps photographs both flanks of a tiger, that individual is considered to be fully identified. However, when only one flank of the tiger is captured, it is identified “partially”. This may lead to biases in population counts. The new model takes such “missing” data points into account. The study titled “A Spatially Explicit Capture – Recapture Model for Partially Identified Individuals When Trap Detection Rate Is Less than One” was conducted by Dr. Soumen Dey, Prof. Mohan Delampady, Dr. K. Ullas Karanth, and Dr. Arjun M. Gopalaswamy.
