The country’s first butterfly park in Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) may have come as a boon for the conservation of the 20 species of butterflies it hosts, but it is proving to be a danger zone for birds in the area. Recently, some visitors witnessed the keepers of the butterfly park, spread over 7.5 acres, shooting down a bird with an air rifle. Reportedly, the staff did not heed the pleas of the visitors not to shoot the innocent intruder. According to sources, it was not an isolated case of the staff using such callous methods to keep off birds.    “I feel it is insane of the butterfly park keepers to do this. Have they been instructed to do so? Looks like the air rifles have been used for this purpose. Can’t they think of a better alternative? We need to stop this,” Srikanth K V, a wildlife enthusiast told. “The staff saw a fly-catcher catching butterflies, and instead of trapping it in a net and releasing it later, shot it with an air rifle,” he said.   “The main butterfly park is an enclosed area and birds can’t enter inside. But the breeding area is open and the staff use air rifles to shoo birds and monkeys away. But that doesn’t mean they are authorised to kill animals and birds in the vicinity. That would be like taking the law in their hands, especially in a place that is meant for the protection of birds and animals,” said sources.   The BBP brass claimed they were unaware of the incident. “I’m not aware of the issue. They must be using air rifles, which make a sound, to drive away birds which come to eat butterflies. I will check if any birds have been killed, and will address the issue immediately,” Dr R Raju, executive director, BBP,told Bangalore Mirror.
