A rescued Egyptian Vulture that became too fat to fly had to be put on a diet before it could take to the skies again. It did so on Saturday with the help of BBMP volunteers.
 
 This is possibly the first time that a rescued bird or animal in the city had to diet. The bird, a rarity in the city, was dehydrated and wounded when it was rescued two months ago from Bangalore Central mall’s parking lot, off M G Road.
 
 During the 40 days of treatment, the bird was fed meat six to seven times a day. As a result, it gained 1.6 kg and efforts to release it last month went in vain. Volunteers were left with no choice but to put the rare guest on a diet.
 
 They fed it with chicken bones, fish and mutton for 20 days. It lost 300 gm which enabled it to pass the “test flight”.
 
 After several “soft launches”, the nine-month-old vulture took flight again on Saturday from the famous Ramadevara Betta in Ramnagar, a declared vulture sanctuary.
 
 “He flew high though he came back to us once,” said Sharath Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore.
 
 Before the vulture was rescued, there was only one other breeding pair registered at IISc campus.
