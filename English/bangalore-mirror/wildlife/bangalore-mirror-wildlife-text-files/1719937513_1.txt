Environmentalists in the state are worried that snares laid to catch wild boars are turning deathtraps for several other animals. Recently, a leopard was killed in Sakleshpur after it was trapped in a snare. 

After several such cases were reported from many parts of the state, the forest department has now decided to begin a combing operation to remove snares, a move that may not go down well with farmers.

Hassan DFO Shivaram Babu told BM, “We received information that a leopard was trapped in a snare at Achanahalli village in Sakleshpur. Even before our staff visited the spot, it was dead. The snare was probably laid for wild boars, but unfortunately a three-year-old leopard was trapped in it. Since it’s a high rainfall area, we usually don’t find leopards. That way, it’s really unfortunate. A FIR has been filed and a case has been taken up under section 200 CRPC. Investigation is under progress.”

Last year, a six-year-old tigress was found dead after being caught in a snare at a coffee estate in Kodagu. Similarly, last November in a night-long operation, the Wildlife SOS team and the Forest Department rescued a sloth bear caught in a poacher’s snare near Chikkaballapur Range. Wildlife activists say even poachers now lay traps to catch animals.

Said environmentalist Dinesh Holla, “First, the state has allowed farmers to kill wild boars. That rule has made things easy for poachers. Now, not just wild boars, but several other animals are getting killed. Hunting is rampant across Karnataka, especially in the Western Ghats. The demand for bisons is such that poachers earn up to Rs 3 lakh per animal. A kg of bison flesh is priced around Rs 300. Usually, a bison weighs around 800-1,000 kg. We know of a particular area where there used to be about 28 bisons, but now there are only 8-10.”
