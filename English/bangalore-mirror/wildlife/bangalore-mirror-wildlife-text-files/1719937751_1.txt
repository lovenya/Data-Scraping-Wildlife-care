From mid-January or February till the end of monsoons, a large number of snakes are seen in Bengaluru. before the season starts, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Wild World Conservation Trust (WWCT) are collaborating to spread awareness on dealing with snake bites and panic management when reptiles are found in homes. 

The first awareness drive has already been held in Malleshwaram. From this week, more such drives will be conducted in Bellandur, Marathahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Yelahanka, Nelamangala and in Doddaballapura, each day. According to BBMP, 658 snake bite cases were registered in Bengaluru in 2018. 

Rajesh Kumar, founder trustee of WWCT and an authorised wildlife rescuer with BBMP, says, “We want to educate people about the role of snakes in urban areas and how to co-exist with them. Snakes act as pest controllers, control the rodent population and hence, reduce diseases. According to WHO, in India, snake bite is a neglected disease as the common man does not know how to react to snake bites. Last year, we collaborated with BBMP and educated around 18,000 children from Bengaluru on snake bites. This year, we will be conducting awareness programmes in apartments, BBMP schools, public spaces, nursing colleges, colleges and in factories.”

The BBMP-authorised rescuers get 30-40 calls each day for snakes to be rescued from residential areas. And in the coming months, till monsoon ends, they expect the numbers to mount to 100-150 calls each day.
