Be it going on a midnight sapling plantation drive or enabling citizens across Whitefield to vote, Whitefield Rising has been active in mobilising people to get engaged with the community. This is what makes it one of the most successful citizen welfare models in the city. 

With 24,417 members, this citizen-centric group turned five on Tuesday. The group began in 2013, and works in six categories, three of which are related to the government, while the other three are independent. These include infrastructure, mobility, amenities, clean and green initiatives, water conservation measures, and wildlife. The group functions in six wards that are a part of Mahadevpura Zone – Hagadur, Kadugodi, Garudacharpalya, Hoodi, Varthur and Doddanekundi. It functions across all social media platforms, the latest addition being instagram.

An administration executive of WR, told BM about the group’s successful initiatives, “We mobilised hundreds of citizens to get enrolled in the voters’ list through awareness on our social media page and organised meet the candidates program so that the voters could choose from the best. One other success story is that we have ensured there is a stop to bribing across Whitefield.” 

Other major contributions of the group are in the field of waste management and lake conservation.
 
Burning issues

WR takes extra caution over fake news. One of the founders of the group says, “We only post things relate to Whitefield and that we are aware of so there has never been a case of wrong information being posted.” 

By November this year, WR is setting up a special cell for dealing with cases of women and child abuse.
