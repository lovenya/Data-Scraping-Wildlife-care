When a sleepy-eyed Santhosh Yellappa Talwar, 30, woke up on Wednesday morning, he found to his shock that he had company. A three-foot baby cobra was sleeping right under his pillow.   The cobra, which was last seen in his Nandini Layout house 15 days ago, emerged from underneath the pillow. Talwar, a radiographer in a ESI Hospital, called the BBMP wildlife volunteers, who went to his house and took the snake away.   Talwar considers himself fortunate. “I’m alive despite two close encounters with a deadly cobra,” he told Bangalore Mirror.Talwar, a native of Gadag, has been living in the ESI quarters since September 2010. He was first warned about the snake by kids in the locality who had sighted it in his flat. He, however, ignored their warnings.   He had his first shock 15 days ago, when he saw the cobra sleeping beside him. “As I woke up, I found the cobra resting beside me. I did nothing as I was terrified. After a few minutes, it just slithered away. I called the BBMP wildlife rescuers, who rushed to my house. By then, the snake was gone,” he said.   Because the snake was sighted in his house twice, Talwar’s parents, who had come to live with him, hastily left for their native place.   The horror came back to haunt him on Wednesday. “I was sleeping with a friend. I woke up and was about to lift the pillow when I found the snake,” said Talwar. “I realised it was sleeping right under my pillow.”   He immediately called the BBMP wildlife staff, who asked him to throw a bedsheet over the snake since it “temporarily blinds the creature”. “I switched on the lights and called the BBMP wildlife volunteers, who came and rescued it.”   “Cobras are venomous and their sting can prove fatal. They strike when they are disturbed and young ones easily get disturbed. In this case, he (Talwar) was lucky to survive two close encounters,” said Rajesh M, a wildlife volunteer who rescued the snake.
