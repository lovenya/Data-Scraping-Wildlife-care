Tragedy struck Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) on Wednesday evening, when an Indian gaur killed its caretaker while he was guiding a safari vehicle inside the herbivore safari area of the park. This was the second reported death of a human inside the safari area since 1992.

Bheema, an 8-year-old gaur, attacked and killed Mallige, a 29-year-old caretaker who was regularly feeding it. Bheema was known for its aggressiveness. Whenever a safari vehicle entered the safari area, it would always charge ahead to attack it. However, the safari guides and caretakers used to scare it away. 

On Wednesday too, Bheema approached a vehicle and Mallige scared it away. Though it disappeared for a few seconds, it sprang upon Mallige while he was returning towards the guardsâ€™ room inside the safari, explained a senior official at the BBP.

In 1992, a girl was mauled to death by a tiger named Bill while cruising past the Tiger safari. Since then, private vehicles are banned in the park and department vehicles carry visitors for the safari.
