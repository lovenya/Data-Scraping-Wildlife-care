The female rhino will be brought from Sanjay Gandhi Botanical and Zoological Garden in Patna, Bihar.

Sipahejala Zoo director Ajit Bhowmik said, “We desperately needed a female one-horned rhino to mate with Pradip, our lone one-horned male rhino.”

The intriguing bit is that Pradip has never seen a female rhino ever since he was brought to the zoo in 1994.

The one-horned rhino is mainly found at Kaziranga in Assam, Nepal and parts of South Africa. Sipahejala sanctuary is situated about 20 km from Tripura’s capital Agartala. It is home to 456 plant species, about 500 animal species and more than 100 species of birds.

The Wildlife Institute of India and the CZA have initiated breeding of four endangered animal species — spectacle monkey, clouded leopard, pigtailed macaque and binturong.

Sipahejala has been notified by the CZA as a national park for breeding and conservation of clouded leopards. In Sipahejala, the animal even breeds in cages, which does not happen anywhere else in the country N B Debnath, the Wildlife Warden of the sanctuary, said the Central government is also funding a project on the spectacle langur, a primate variety found only in Tripura and adjoining areas.
