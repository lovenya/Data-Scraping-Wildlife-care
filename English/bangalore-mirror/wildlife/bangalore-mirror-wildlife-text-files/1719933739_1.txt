The leopard that has injured many people and has been sighted near the city’s outskirts for the last two weeks has eluded capture. Two days ago, the leopard was spotted near the National Law College of India campus near Jnana Bharathi. Apparently, the forest department officials had laid a trap in the form of an iron cage for it.

On Sunday, pug marks of the leopard were found very close to the trap, but the animal had not taken the bait. This has left the forest officials worried, as the wild animal has attacked a number of people and stray dogs. When Bangalore Mirror visited the place, the fur of a dog was found in the nearby forest area. Scattered around was a dog skull and a bone which indicated that the leopard had eaten a stray dog a few days earlier. As the place is covered with wild bushes and huge trees, it acts as a perfect hideout for the leopard.

Stray dogs easy prey
“We see a large number of stray dogs in and around the city. They are easy prey for the leopard. This maybe the reason why leopards from surrounding forest areas come to the city. This also leads to the attack on humans which we saw on Magadi Road last week,” a wildlife expert said. He said the only way to prevent wild animals from entering the city is to bring down the number of stray dogs.
