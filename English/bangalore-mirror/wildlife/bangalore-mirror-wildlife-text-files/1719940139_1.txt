 Ode to remember
Witness an attempt to clean the dust off the old diary, feel the now yellowed pages, and smell the air that once was new with ‘Ghazal Wali Diary,’ a Ghazal music performance by Muqtalif at Atta Galatta. Muqtalif, which means different, is formed by Shreyas, Dheeraj Bannerjea, and Aparupa, who have found a way to remember some musicians and songs that mustn’t gather dust on the webpages. These are songs that are meant to celebrate the heartaches, the bad decisions, and the glorious mistakes that now can’t be undone.
