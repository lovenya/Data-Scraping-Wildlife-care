The Tanzanian Students’ Association of Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies organised their 4th cultural exhibition on the campus at Soladevanahalli on Thursday. The students set up stalls to showcase their country’s geography, culture, tradition, food, standard of living, way of dressing, traditional dance as well as the wildlife. 
 Anisha Nongrum, a third year student of BA Journalism, said she was excited to learn about Tanzanian traditions and culture. “It was very informative. I never knew that Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania. I want to visit that country at least once in my life,” she said.  
 Diana, a Tanzanian student, said, “We are very glad to showcase our culture and tradition. It makes us feel proud to introduce our friends and teachers to our culture. Unlike the common notion, people in our country lead a peaceful life.""
