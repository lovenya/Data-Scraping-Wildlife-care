Karnataka Forest Department’s Central Forest Library is all set to host the third edition of its three-day annual exhibition for wildlife enthusiasts, research scholars and others in the next few days. The exhibition will be held on the 8th floor of Aranya Bhavan situated on Chowdaiah Road, Malleshwaram and is slated to be held in February.

S Usha Kumari, Librarian of the Central Forest Library, says, “Last year, we had a footfall of over 500 people in the three-day exhibition. This year, we expect more. A number of scholars from IISc and other institutions and those preparing for competitive exams visit to buy books on wildlife, especially for research purposes. Most of our vendors are from North India. The department is to review the proposal. Currently, it is still in the planning stages. But we hope that the third edition of the exhibition has some unique books, journals or researches.”

The annual exhibition started in 2016, with vendors from all over India exhibiting books on various subjects relating to flora and fauna. The library has a collection of over 20,000 books and journals and is one of the largest libraries in South India that focus solely on the subjects of forests and ecology.
