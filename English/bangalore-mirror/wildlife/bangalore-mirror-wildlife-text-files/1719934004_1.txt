Krishnappa thinks adopting an animal is a good way to celebrate birthdays          Joining a band of celebrities who have adopted wild animals, Krishnappa told Bangalore Mirror that his reason for choosing the king of the jungle was religious. “According to Hindu culture, all animals are symbolic. The lion is the vehicle of the powerful devi (goddess) and by adopting it, I felt that the blessings of the goddess would always be with me.”

The lion is kept at Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP). It was during a visit to BBM with Transport Minister R Ashok and scores of children that “the parks official told me that they were facing shortage of finance to manage wild animals. I promised to adopt an animal. I hope other elected representatives will do the same. I will approach cabinet ministers myself,” he said.

Krishnappa thinks that instead of spending lakhs on a birthday bash, people can adopt a wild animal — a far more memorable way to celebrate a birthday.

The MLA has not yet named the lion as most adopters do. But he knows what he wants to do next — adopt an elephant as it is symbolic of Lord Ganesha.

Kumble has a cobra
Cricketer Anil Kumble, who adopted a King Cobra, told Bangalore Mirror that it was the love for wildlife which drove him to adopt wild animals. “It is everyone’s duty to conserve wildlife. Wildlife must be left wild,” he said.
