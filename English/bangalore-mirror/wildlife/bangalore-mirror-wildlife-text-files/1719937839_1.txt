The duo set grass patch on fire to chase tigers away

The forest department has taken two people into custody who sparked the blaze at the Bandipur National Park. 

Hanumanthaiah, 70 and Gopaiah, 60, the two accused, are shepherds in the Bandipur reserve area. Fearing attacks on their cattle by tigers in Bandipur, they had lit the fire on February 22, leading to large-scale fire, destroying thousands of acres of forest cover. 

 Range Forest Officer Puttaswamy H said the blaze was purely man-made. “They purposely lit the fire. Since the wind speed was very high, the fire spread quickly.”

Sighting of a tiger last week scared villagers and they were worried about their cattle and goats. The forest department had then taken several measures to catch the tiger, but in vain. 

Puttaswamy said, “We have kept a bait, installed CCTV cameras and deployed four elephants at the spot where the tiger was seen but we could not find it. The shepherds were afraid that the tiger might attack them or their cattle and thought the fire would drive the predators away. The accused have been booked under section 27, 29, 30, 31, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.” 

The accused were presented before the Civil Court of Gundlupet at around 5:30 pm the same day. On Saturday, Punati Sridhar, Principal Conservator of Forests, said the culprits had been caught. He said, “Bandipur Tiger reserve staff have arrested those who were involved in setting fire to GS Betta area.” 

To avoid forest fires, the forest department has now deployed additional officers in the area with walkie-talkies, besides taking several other steps. The Bandipur Tiger reserve is now open to tourists. The reserve was only closed for a few hours on February 22.
