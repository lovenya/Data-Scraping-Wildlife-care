A video on climate change and clean energy — ‘Shanti Samsara’ that was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and France President Francois Hollande and watched by several global leaders in Paris two days ago has an interesting Karnataka connection. 
 
 	While the background has been scored by Grammy awardee Ricky Kej, the scenic video footage has been filmed by an IFS officer from Karnataka Forest Department and Bengaluru-based filmmaker Amoghavarsha.
 	  	A major part of the scenic video footage that forms Kej’s latest album on creating environmental consciousness has been taken from the 20-minute short-film Kali, directed by Amogha Varsha and Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserve Director Srinivasulu. Both had worked extensively on visual-rich short film ‘Kali’ for almost a year and released the film for public in August 2015 in Bengaluru.
 	  	Interestingly, the same visuals from the Kali movie have become a major part of Ricky Kej’s album on climate change. Sharing the experiences with Bangalore Mirror, conservator of forests and director, DATR Srinivasulu said that he and his team of officials and crew were happy about the development Nevertheless, accolades have been pouring in for the team and director duo from various quarters of the bureaucracy. 
 	  	 		Happy credit was given
 		 	 		“We were neither consulted nor informed by anybody that our film visuals have been incorporated into the album. But somebody passed on the message on Tuesday that the new documentary released by PM Modi has visuals from our film. 	 		
 		However, towards the end they have given us (Karnataka Forest Department) credit too, which is more than enough for us,” Srinivasulu explained. 
 		  Amoghavarsha, a wildlife filmmaker who is also one of the directors of Kali film said, “While making the movie itself, we had registered it under creative common licence so that anybody can make use of our film for non-commercial purpose.”
