The team of 32 volunteers at the BBMP wildlife rescue cell has received more than 600 calls in the past four days after the city was affected by heavy rain.
 
 Around 60 per cent of the calls received were for help to rescue snakes that entered homes. Even BBMP officials had to call the volunteers to save themselves from a cobra that had entered the BBMP office premises. 
 
 The rescue cell had a tough time attending to the numerous calls to save more than 50 snakes and birds. BBMP wildlife advisor Sharath Babu R said, “For the past four days, we have not had time for anything other than attending to calls from the public to rescue snakes and birds. The BBMP administrator and commissioner the-mselves witnessed seven calls related to the rescue of snakes in a span of 10 minutes. Each volunteer has received more than 90 calls.” 
 “On Monday, there was a call from a BBMP official who said there was a cobra inside the BBMP building premises. Our volunteer rescued the snake within 20 minutes,” said Sharath.
 Another volunteer said, “In several places, snakes were found hiding in places where garbage and unused things were dumped. As rainwater starts gushing inside their holes, snakes come out and look for shelter. But all snake bites are curable and anti-venom is available in Bengaluru city.”
