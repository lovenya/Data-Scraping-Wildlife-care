This has been made possible by an Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), an NGO supported by its partner, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), which has purchased nearly 25 acres in Kollegal (Edayarhalli-Doddasampige) elephant corridor from private owners and transferred them to the state government.

  

The corridor, which connects Kollegal forests to Biligiri Ranganswamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary, will soon be notified to be made a part of a protected area as Karnataka Forest Department officials and WTI signed the land ownership transfer agreement last week.

â€œPurchasing corridor land for securement is a very good initiative to re-establish the habitat and remove impediments to elephant movement.
