Ramesh admitted there was failure of “governance and administration” in the project and said he had despatched National Tiger Conservation Authority Chairman Rajesh Gopal to Sariska to ascertain the cause of the death of the tiger.

“I admit that there has been a failure of governance and administration, and I take full responsibility for that. But to say that the relocation program is not working is wrong,” he said here.

He asserted that the best scientists of the country were working on the tiger relocation programme.

Gopal and some scientists have been sent to Rajasthan and “they are examining the cause of the death of the tiger”. 

Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot was also concerned with the matter. Ramesh said Gehlot has assured him that he would look at various issues linked with mining around Sariska and Ranthambore. A tiger relocated from the Ranthambhore tiger reserve to the Sariska wildlife park was found dead last week, raising questions over the big-cat revival experiment.
