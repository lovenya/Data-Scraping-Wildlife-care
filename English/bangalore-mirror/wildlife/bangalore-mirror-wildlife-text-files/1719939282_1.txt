Karnataka Police have arrested four people and seized 1,132 star turtles in the state capital which were brought for sale in the limits of RMC Yard police station, police reported on Sunday.

The police said that the accused were nomads and stayed on the fringes of forests in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and fetched star turtles from jungles. They sold them to people who in turn used them for Vaastu and manufacturing of medicines.

They have made this as their source of livelihood and their families depended on the income generated through the sale of these turtles. The accused have told the police that they had sold 100 star turtles earlier in Mumbai.

The police took three of the accused into custody from the Goraguntepalya bus station in Bengaluru after gathering specific inputs and seizing 963 star turtles. The fourth accused was arrested in Chikkaballapur and more turtles were seized from his residence. Further investigation is on.

Star turtles are protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and anyone found in possession of these can face criminal charges with sentences of up to six months in prison.
