Janata Dal (Secular) JDS Party MLA of Nagamangala constituency, Suresh Gowda, was booked under non-bailable sections of the IPC 353 - for obstructing public servants from discharging their duties along with other criminal offences such as intentional insult, unlawful assembly, and criminal intimidation while he had confronted a group of Forest Department officials who were duty to clear encroachments of the deemed forest land in a village Halthi in Mandya on Friday.
 
The forest department officials had gone to clear encroachments by villagers who had dug up trenches into deemed forest lands in order to cultivate crops, and as soon as the forest officials - Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) Shankare Gowda, Range Forest Officer (RFO) Sathish B, and Deputy RFO MK Prakash and other staff went to stop the work, the villagers informed their MLA Gowda who rushed to the spot and not only abused the forest officials, but also threatened them by instigating the villagers into not allowing the officials inside their village or even set fire to forest vehicles if they force themselves in. The MLA had heated arguments with the forest officials and warned them to come only after conducting a joint survey by both Revenue Department officials and the Forest Department officials of the deemed forest land.

A video lasting over 2 minutes of Gowda speaking disrespectfully to the forest officials, abusing and threatening them had gone viral on social media and created an uproar among environmentalists and wildlife conservationists who wrote to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) to initiate legal proceedings against the offender.

On August 5, around 11.30 pm, RFO Sathish B and his colleagues approached the Nagamanagala rural police station and filed a complaint against the MLA based on which a case was registered against the MLA and 10 others from the village. But, the police have been tight-lipped on the legal action taken. It is a discretion of the investigating officer whether or not to arrest a culprit in the case, said police sources adding the MLA has moved his legal team for obtaining an anticipatory bail too.

According to the forest officials, the land in question at the Halthi village is deemed forest and the state government through a gazette notification had transferred 374 acres to the forest department recently of which the forest officials even had the government order carried along with them. â€“ Bellie Thomas
