Only days after the state woke up to the nightmare of the Bandipur forest range wildfire, 12 deer were found dead near the Mettikuppe range of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. Late on Tuesday, seven barking deer and five chital deer were found dead after consuming water laden with urea from the Hebbala pond, it is suspected. The pond in JM Halli village is less than a kilometre from the forest.
 
 
 
 
 Scarcity of fodder and water in forests is driving hungry and thirsty animals to cultivated lands where farmers, keen to protect their land and crop at all costs, use pesticides and fertilisers at will.
 
 While animal lovers and experts suspect that the deer died after they consumed contaminated water, fish in the pond continued to live, questioning the possibility.
 
 A sample of the water has been sent to a forensic laboratory to throw light on the unfortunate incident.
 
 Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Dr Umashankar, veterinarian at Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, said, “We have finished the post-mortem. We suspect the deaths were caused because of urea in the Kempanayaka Hebballa pond.”
 
 “Urea used in the nearby farms may have flowed into the pond. But the fish in the water have not died. However, we will send a sample of the water and the intestine, liver and stomach of the deer to the forensic laboratory in Mysuru,” he said.
 
 A complaint has been registered in the HD Kote police station. The incident has caused anguish among animal lovers. The authorities are not taking precautionary measures to protect wildlife, they say.
