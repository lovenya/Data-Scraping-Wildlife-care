Bengaluru: After battling the worst fire till date, the forest officials along with emergency service personnel and volunteers have managed almost to douse the fire, which broke out at the Bandipur Tiger Reserve.

Responding to a request from the state CM HD Kumaraswamy, the Indian Air Force deployed two choppers that worked in close coordination with district authorities. The two helicopters have conducted over 10 sorties and sprayed more than 30,000 litres of water to arrest the spread of the fire. They are expected to resume operations at daybreak on Tuesday.

Earlier today, scion of the Mysuru royal family, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, took to social media and asked volunteers to help the forest officials to contain the damage at Bandipur. He requested the youths in particular to help the authorities.

In an ordeal that stretched over four days, the fire destroyed around 2,000 acres of Bandipur forest to ashes. It is also feared to have killed hundreds of wild animals, reptiles and insects as well as endangering the lives of tigers. Three ranges – Kundakere, Bandipur and Gopalaswamy Betta– were engulfed by the flames.

“We suspect that it is not a natural fire, but a man-made one. About 1,500 men including volunteers are on the field. It is suspected that the buffer area could be affected more than that core area,” an officer said.
