Conservation efforts of the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD), especially in Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, received global recognition when a Mysurean, Vikram C, serving as a forest guard at Veeranahosalli Range of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve scaled Mt Everest successfully on Thursday. On reaching the summit, Vikram not only hoisted the Karnataka flag but also unfurled a banner explaining tiger conservation activities in Nagarahole.

Vikram’s colleagues in Hunsur Wildlife Division of KFD told Bangalore Mirror that he had been an adventure enthusiast and had nurtured the dream of climbing the tallest peak since his student days. “Even during work, he loved working on adventurous assignments and volunteered often to carry out patrol in the remotest areas of the park,” recalled a colleague.

Preparing to summit the tallest peak, Vikram had been undergoing several fitness training on his own. 

Despite his rigorous work, Vikram never used to miss his training schedule. Vikram is the second official from the Karnataka Forest Department to scale the Everest after a Deputy Conservator of Forests S Prabhakaran had successfully climbed the Everest in 2016.
