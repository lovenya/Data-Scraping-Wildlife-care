Stories of sustainability, revelry and festive fervour came alive over the weekend as India’s greenest music festival made its grand return to its home turf in Bengaluru. Echoes of Earth, in its fifth edition this year, paid a tribute to the ‘Circle of Life’ as it celebrated the melange of nature, culture and great live music in the midst of sprawling 180-acred lush green vistas of the Embassy Riding School on December 3 and 4.

This year’s theme, ‘Circle of Life,’ shifted the onus towards an inclusive circle where all life begins and thrives alongside wildlife and nature conservation and regeneration stories from unexplored corners of India’s diverse ecosystems. It witnessed an eclectic mix of over 40 local and international artists converge on four upcycled stages - the Johnnie Walker non-alcoholic refreshing mixer Amur Falcon stage, The Himalayan Ibex stage, The Budweiser Indian Red Scorpion stage and the solar-powered Big Tree stage.
 
Bringing unique global sounds to the fore, the festival was a melting pot of music genres like Electronic, Soul, World fusion, Jazz, Techno, Blues, Reggae, Rock, Live Electronica and more.
 
As audience swooned over enthralling performances by Hanumankind, The Lojal Experience, Anyasa, Vairaagi, Tara Lily, The Yussef Dayes Experiences, Henry Saiz & Band presents Moonlight Wolves, Vieux Farka Toure, T.ill Apes, and others, the festival gave greater momentum to the idea of living life eco-consciously.

Roshan Netalkar, Festival Director at Echoes of Earth said, “In these two days, we witnessed the incredible energy and passion of over 20,000 people who celebrated responsibly - keeping the ethos of the festival alive - In spite of the large turnout we were able to create a zero-waste festival. It is our endeavour to innovate further and to make the festival carbon neutral in the years to come.”
