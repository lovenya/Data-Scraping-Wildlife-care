Fresh fear of poaching at the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) gripped forest department personnel after a man was arrested with a weapon for illegal entry.

According to a forest department official, two persons had entered the Ragihalli reserve forest area of Bannerghatta National Park with weapons on Friday. After getting the information on this, the Anti Poaching Camp (APC) staff of BNP alerted the night patrolling team.

“We had deployed staff immediately after getting the information in anticipation of any illegal activity. Forces mobilised within a short period of time and caught hold of a person named Joseph Raju, a 40- year-old male from Tattaguppe, located within the buffer zone of BNP. A 26-year-old male (Vishal) from the village is absconding,” said the official.

Officials say the poachers could be nabbed before they could kill wildlife due to the ramped-up infrastructure facility to prevent poaching attempts.
 
“We have anti-poaching camps at strategic locations in the park. While we conduct patrolling regularly, the intensity is high on certain days. The forest is more vulnerable to poaching on days before festivals. In this case, there was a village festival on Saturday. We had anticipated this and put on staff on high alert at strategic locations. The APC is manned by four people and is our backbone when it comes to preventing wildlife poaching,” said Prabhakar Priyadarshi, deputy conservator of forests, BNP.
