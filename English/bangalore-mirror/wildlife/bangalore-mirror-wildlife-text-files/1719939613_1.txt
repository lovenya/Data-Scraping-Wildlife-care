On World Environment Day, B’lureans work for an eco-friendly city

In commemoration of World Environment Day, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) organised an awareness event at Bengaluru Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBBP) on June 3-4. Over 20,000 plus citizens participated during the awareness practices. The public were very thrilled and enjoyed the awareness session and assured themselves to stop single-use plastics.
 
The event aimed to educate participants about the detrimental effects of single-use plastics and disposables on the environment and wildlife, while promoting sustainable alternatives and waste reduction practices.
 
The alternative waste management processes, reduction and reuse, and individual actions towards a sustainable lifestyle were highlighted at the stalls, with placards and a selfie booth.
 
The event also facilitated focused awareness by experts in different fields including forest officers for enhancing knowledge about low-carbon waste management among the stakeholders.
 
The event was organised as a part of the NAMA Facility supported project titled ‘Circular Waste Solutions’ which is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. The Indo-German development cooperation project has joined hands with the NGO called Saahas to educate citizens on SUP ban and the ill effects of it on the environment by way of various activities like the street play and games.

Trashing the plastic trash 

Minister for Forests, Ecology and Environment, Ishwara Khandre, has announced that five major cities in the state will be made plastic waste-free this year.
 
Khandre was addressing a gathering at an award function organized on the occasion of World Environment Day by the Department of Forest, Ecology and Environment in association with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board at the Central College Campus on Monday to honor individuals and organizations for their contribution to the environment.
 
“Apart from enforcing a strict ban on SUPs, we are committed to segregation and recycling of plastic waste into usable materials. The government will encourage startups involved in the research and development of innovative technologies to beat plastic pollution. We will also create a ‘green fund’ in collaboration with private sector CSR funding to support all these initiatives. Moreover, in line with the UN’s initiative, a special drive will be taken up in five major cities in Karnataka to make them plastic waste free,” said Khandre.
 
The minister also said that the department will plant five crore saplings across the state with the help of students and the public. He also said that required steps will be taken to monitor hospital waste and e-waste disposal systems.
 
Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar also attended the event.

Planting saplings for a greener future 

Suresh Kumar, a resident of Sahakarnagar, was acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Mann Ki Baat address on October 30, 2022 for his passion for protecting nature, made arrangements to plant 400 saplings on Monday, World Environment Day.
 
“I made arrangements to plant 400 saplings at Sahakarnagar in the city and Sondekoppa and Hullegowdanahalli in Nelamangala Taluk,’’ said Suresh Kumar with a smile.
 
Suresh said that he has selected Sondekoppa and Hullegowdanahalli for planting saplings as there is no sufficient space at Sahakarnagar due to concretisation of the area. “I along with friends and volunteers have planted 25 saplings at Sahakaranagar today on the occasion of the World Environment Day. We planted 150 saplings at Sondekoppa and Hullegowdanahalli today. Planting of saplings will continue for two more days,’’ Suresh Kumar said.
