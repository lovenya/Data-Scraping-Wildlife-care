London: It is usually patients who are afraid of dentists, but when a 75-stone polar bear needed root canal treatment, the dynamics of that relationship could easily have changed around.    Arktos the polar bear had been suffering from toothache so vets from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland had to check over his 42 razor sharp teeth.   Early on Thursday, Arktos was darted with tranquilisers and the three-hour dental operation began. Keepers had noticed the usually playful polar bear seemed to be feeling sorry for himself and not hanging out with fellow bear Walker quite so much.   Walker and Arktos, the only polar bears on display in the UK, had been trained to open their mouths to show their keepers their terrifying teeth.   A small area of discolouration was spotted on Arktos’ upper left canine tooth and the Highland Wildlife Park called in external dental experts to fix the problem.   When experts got four-year-old Arktos into the equivalent of a dentist’s chair - a specially reinforced table made from scaffolding poles and planks - they discovered he needed a root canal.   One of his teeth had become rotted, so it needed drilling out, cleaning and then packing with dental cement.    Douglas Richardson, Animal Collection Manager at the Highland Wildlife Park, said: “Due to his size, an operation like this is never straight forward.“   The operation involved a team of ten experts: two dentists, two radiographers, two veterinarians, one vet nurse and three senior animal staff.   It took three hours in total and Arktos just took 20 minutes to come round. He was then up on his feet, although still a bit wobbly. “He had a drink and we expect him to start eating soon.“
