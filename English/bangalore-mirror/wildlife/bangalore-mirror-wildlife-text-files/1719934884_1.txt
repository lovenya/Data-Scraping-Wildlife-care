The forest department, concerned over the deaths of three tigers in the state in the past five months, is thinking of asking the CID, forest cell, to probe the cases. The probe may also throw light on other tiger deaths in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve that comprises the Bandipur, Madhumalai, Wayanad, Mudumalai and Nagarhole reserves.    The first tiger was found dead in D B Kuppe in January and the second in the Metikuppe range in February, while in April a person caught in possession of a tiger skin said it came from a tiger in the Gundre forest range of Bandipur and that it had died of poisoning. The poisons used in the first two cases have been identified as metacid and zinc phosphate, sources said.    Wildlife experts see the hand of a poaching gang in the animals’ deaths. “The three deaths are identical and a result of poisoning. When we look at the locations, all three places are closely located and not more than two to three aerial kilometres from one another,” Sudheer K S, managing trustee of Voice for Wildlife Trust, told Bangalore Mirror.    Wildlife experts feel a higher-level probe is needed. “Though the CID, forest cell can probe it, it will only be gathering information, reaching the source and seizing the material. However, if it’s the COD, it will be stronger as the CID, forest cell doesn’t have the authority to arrest the accused,” Sudheer said.   Forest department officials preferred not to comment on the probe and maintained ground-level staff were addressing the issue. “We are concerned and we are doing everything possible on this front. That’s all I can say,” Hosmath B J, chief conservator of forests  (Project Tiger), told BM.
