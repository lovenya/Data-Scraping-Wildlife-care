In a bid to educate people about the animal, authorities at Mysore zoo have decided to import two pairs of cheetahs from the Leipzig zoo in Germany.
“We expect them to arrive by the end of January 2011,” deputy director, Mysore zoo, N T Vijayakumar told Bangalore Mirror. THE FRIENDLY CAT

Earliest records indicate that cheetahs (scientific name is Acinonyx Jubatus) arrived in India through the north western passes. It was once found in abundance across the country, including in Karnataka. It is an extremely friendly animal that could be easily domesticated. It is held in awe worldwide for its ability to run at 110 kilometres/hour. 

Mughal emperor Akbar had about 1,000 cheetahs that were trained to hunt. In times gone by, people used to blindfold a cheetah and take it to the forests. When they sighted a herd of antelopes, they would remove the blindfold and release the cheetah. The cheetah would plunge into the herd at lightning speed and kill a few antelopes.

“The two pairs that we are getting from Germany were born in 2007. They will be brought to India by ship. We hope people will be pleased to have them here,” said Vijayakumar. CHEETAH VS LEOPARD

The cheetah's slim body, round head, tear marks around the eyes, bare claws and black spots all over the body differentiates the long-legged cat from a leopard. A leopard's spots resemble rosettes. It is plump, has retractable claws and is more powerful than a cheetah. A leopard cannot be domesticated since it is notorious for mood swings. THE INDIA STORY
The last three cheetahs were shot dead by the maharaja of the erstwhile Korea kingdom in Bastar district in Madhya Pradesh. Even then, the act drew widespread condemnation from wildlife enthusiasts.
