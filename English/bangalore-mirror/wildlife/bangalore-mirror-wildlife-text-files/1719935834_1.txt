Cubbon Park police witnessed high drama on Friday after a rare guest sneaked in, giving way to some tense moments.
 
 The guest was a rat snake, almost 6-feet-long.
 
 The police who sighted the snake in a file rack inside the station, called in the city wildlife rescue team.
 
 Till the team reached, the staff had to spend time outside the station. However, after over 30 minutes, Mohan K, who rushed to the spot around 2.30 pm, was quick to spot and rescue the reptile.
 
 This led to a happy ending.
 
 The snake was a rat snake and was Mohanâ€™s second such rescue. Another rate snake was rescued outside the station six months ago.
 
 Mohan, who rescued it in 10 minutes, released it back into a conducive habitat.
 
 The police were relieved to learn that the rat snake was non-venomous.
