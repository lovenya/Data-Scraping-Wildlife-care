Inspired by the YouTube comments section, comics present a new concept show that will leave you in splits
 
 
 For fans of stand-up comedy, here’s a show with a difference. The Comment Section, a new concept-based comedy show, will have five comics -- Kenneth Sebastian, Kanan Gill, Biswa Kalyan Rath, Utsav Chakraborty and Vamsi Bhogaraju — humorously dissecting 15-minutes of YouTube videos handpicked by each of them. The quintet will act like how commentators on YouTube actually behave, “that is why it is called the Comment Section,” Sebastian says.
 	  	 “Johnny Lever used to do something like this back in the 70s, where he would hire a small theatre, screen the film, pause it in parts and make fun of it. The idea for the show came from there,” says Sebastian, the 24-year old stand-up comic from Bengaluru who now has a successful TV show on Comedy Central. “Biswa (Kalyan Rath) and Utsav (Chakraborty) were planning something like this for one of their videos and brought it to my attention, and I thought it would be better if we did that in person to a live audience,” he adds.
 	  	As Sebastian says, the topics can range from Bollywood to ads to documentaries, anything goes. “We don’t know what the others have picked so our reactions will be genuine. And each of the comedians will bring something different to the table. Kanan, Utsav and I have a strong western influence whereas Biswa and Vamsi’s humour is more local. For example, Vamsi is doing a bit about kabbadi which none of us would have thought of,” he says, adding that his section will be about wildlife videos on YouTube. To keep the show dynamic, they plan to have different comics on the roster on the upcoming shows who will bring their unique style to the show and no two shows will be the same.
