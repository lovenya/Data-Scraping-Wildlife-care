A day after some forest department officials visited the pet therapy centre at St John’s Medical College Hospital, a preliminary report recommends that the therapy centre be shut down. Bangalore Mirror found spotted deer, sambar and peacocks in the hospital premises—all of which are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act and cannot be reared in private—and alerted the Forest Department, which immediately swung into action.
 
 The report filed by Range Forest Officer, Bangalore South, states that the living condition of the animals is not satisfactory. Besides, “The hospital does not have any research documentation for which permission was granted to house the animals in 1998. I am waiting for the deputy forest officer’s report on the matter as well. But we are serious about shutting down the facility and shifting the animals to an appropriate venue,” said Kumar Pushkar, conservator of forests, Bangalore.
 
 More startling facts have surfaced during the investigation. The hospital had written to the Central Zoo Authority of India to be recognised under the Zoo and Parks Act and had also requested for alligators to be added to their ‘pet’ therapy centre.
 While the decision to shut the facility is sure to benefit most of the animals in the centre, it won’t help the four male emus. The emu, which is classified as an exotic animal (it is the national bird of Australia), is not protected under the Wildlife Protection Act of India and does not fall under the purview of the forest department.
 
 What’s more, these poor six-year-old souls have been waiting for female companionship but have had no luck so far because the hospital authorities say they have been unable to find female partners for them.
