Petition seeks greener celebrations this Independence Day

As Independence Day approaches, the entire country gears up for celebrations. However, amid the festive spirit, numerous environment-conscious individuals and groups across the nation have come forward starting a petition to Prime Minister, Narendra Modi to curtail the widespread use of balloons in festivities, citing the detrimental impact of such practices on the environment.

The organisation ‘Beautiful Bharat’ started the petition along with 40 various other groups and citizens supporting them like the Amulya Boondh Foundation, Bangalore Apartment Federation, Indian Ploggers Army, Hasiru Dala, HSR Citizens Forum, Gift Green India, Saahas Zero Waste and others.
 
One of the main concerns highlighted by the organisation is the use of non-biodegradable balloons, which contribute to pollution when they descend after release. The harmful chemicals from these balloons contaminate the soil and water bodies, disrupting the delicate ecosystem and posing health risks to humans through the food chain. Wildlife and marine ecosystems also suffer, as many animals mistake balloon fragments for food, leading to ingestion and entanglement, often resulting in fatalities.

Odette Katrak from Beautiful Bharat said, “Balloons cause harm as it results in land pollution and a huge factor is that balloons cause risk of choking, wherein if children ingest the balloon they can choke to death. There are many incidents reported in the past where infants have consumed balloons and it has resulted in choking.
 
While we are honouring Mother India, should we be disrespecting mother nature? The tricolours go floating when they burst and come back to the land or sea, and they look like food. This can cause immediate harm to the creatures that swallow them. At a time when the planet is stressed like never before, every little action of ours counts. We will present the petition on August 11, which will give the government enough time to announce and completely stop the usage of balloons.”

The petition also points out the aftermath of celebrations, with balloon remains littering the environment and causing challenges for municipalities. Additionally, helium wastage is a concern due to the use of balloons.

To address these issues, the organisations advocate for nationwide public awareness campaigns, educating citizens about the harmful effects of balloons on the environment, wildlife, and human health. They urge the implementation of a policy framework and regulatory measures to ban the manufacture, sale, or use of balloons. The emphasis is on encouraging sustainable alternatives, such as cloth, paper, or flower decorations that can be reused, recycled, or composted. Moreover, they stress the importance of collaborating with educational institutions to incorporate environmental education and sustainability into the curriculum, fostering a culture of responsible celebrations among students.
