So what if blackbuck is an endangered wild animal protected under schedule I of Indian Wildlife Act? Its horn is supposed to bring good luck and stave off evil spirits. And some unscrupulous auto-rickshaw drivers, who do not care much for rules in the first place, have got the banned item fitted as an accessory to their vehicles.   The illegal and dangerous trend was spotted by wildlife sleuths during a recent drive, and it was reported to the national wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB). The sleuths sent a detailed report, including registration numbers of 22 autowallahs allegedly using the horns. More than 800 autos in the state are suspected to be fitted with the horn, and several more could be in the queue to get the horn, a source told Bangalore Mirror.   The illegal practice is most rampant in the Chitradurga-Belgaum stretch. Its proximity to the Ranebennur Blackbuck Sanctuary could only mean that blackbuck are being poached for horns as the animal doesn’t shed horn in its lifetime, the wildlife fraternity fears.   “It’s shocking to find that wildlife products are used this way,” Sharath R Babu, honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, told Bangalore Mirror.    Acting on a tip-off, wildlife sleuths from the city carried out a week-long exercise in various towns in north Karnataka, including Davangere, Harihara and Harapanahalli and found vehicles fitted with blackbuck horns.   “This is an alarming trend. The autowallahs using blackbuck horns seem to have no explanation on how they procured them,” Sharath said. “Possessing products of an animal protected under Schedule I is a punishable offence. The autowallahs’ explanation that the horns were procured after blackbucks shed them can’t be bought as the animals never shed horns. That could only mean that blackbucks are being poached.” Worse still, because of the high demand for the horns, automobile shops in the area have got involved in selling them.
