The forest department is all set to inaugurate a tree park that faces the sea at Tannirbavi on Saturday.  	Speaking of the upcoming event to media persons in Mangaluru, Dr KT Hanumanthappa, deputy conservator of forests, Mangaluru, said, “The tree park is being developed as per a government order, which stated that every district must have a tree park. The minimum land requirement for setting up a tree park was prescribed as 15 acres of land. The state already has about five such parks, but this is the only one facing the sea.”  	“The park has been developed on 15 hectares of land at a cost of Rs 1.95 crore. Of this, in nine hectares of land, the department has planted Calophyllum inophyllum. The area of the tree park is known for its naturally-grown casuarina trees. On six hectares of land, about 50 trees of this Western Ghats native are being planted. The park was fenced at a cost of Rs 32 lakh. In addition, an herbal garden with 14 species of plants is being developed, and there are sufficient footpaths and benches in it,” he said.  	"The park is for conservation, awareness, education and relaxation. There will also be an information centre on ecosystem, marine biodiversity, Western Ghats and wildlife. We have also incorporated the cultural component of the region in the form of Yakshagana, Kambala and Bootha Kola tableaus," he added.  	The park also houses a children's play area, food court and volleyball court. Since the area is a coastal regulatory zone, temporary wooden structures have been used. In future, the forest department hopes to tie up with Jungle Lodges and Resorts and introduction water sports here.  	A tree park management committee will be formed after the inauguration to monitor and take the project forward and after the committee’s first meeting, an entry fee will be imposed, tentatively from the first week of April, officials in the know revealed.  	Also, children will be brought to the park on educational tours.
