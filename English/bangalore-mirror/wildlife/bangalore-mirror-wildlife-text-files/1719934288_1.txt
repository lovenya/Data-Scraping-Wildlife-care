The route from Byrasandra to Koramangala witnessed a fortified ‘caravan’ on Saturday, which included a battalion of Karnataka State Reserve Police and a Hoysala team. At the centre of the caravan was an eleven-month-old camel rescued by the BBMP’s wildlife cell staff.
 
 When a mob began to pelt stones at the camel rescued from being slaughtered at Byrasandra, near Jayanagar, these ‘forces’ were called to escort the animal as part of the camel rescue drive across the city.
 
 They escorted the camel till it safely reached an animal shelter at Koramangala.
 
 R Sharath Babu, the wildlife advisor to BBMP, said, “We sought help after the situation went out of control. The police top-brass acted immediately.” 
 SLAUGHTER BAN
 The police department sent out a circular last month banning camel slaughter across the city under Karnataka Prevention of Animal Slaughter Act 1963. 
 
 The BBMP too sent out a similar circular in view of Bakrid, when the number of camels being slaughtered is said to go up.
 Subsequently, the BBMP wildlife cell launched a drive to save over 80 camels brought illegally into the city.
 
 The cell’s first rescue sparked Saturday’s incident. 
 
 The camel was brought to Tilaknagar police station after its rescue. However, trouble began when the wildlife volunteers decided to shift it to the animal shelter.
 
 When the camel refused to get into the truck, they decided to make it walk. That’s when the trouble began. A mob of over 300 followed the animal and started pelting stones at it.
 
 “Rescuing camels from its owners, who use it for commercial purpose, is risky,” said Sunil Dugar, the president of Akhila Karnataka Prani Daya Sangha, which runs the camel shelter.
