Hyderabad: Coal mine workers spotted a tiger resting roadside in an area adjoining forest in Telangana's Kumaram Bheem Asifabad district on Wednesday evening.

The workers were returning home when they came across the wild animal and were panicked.

The tiger was sitting on a heap of mud near Tiryani village. The workers ran to the village and informed the forest officials.

Officials believe that the tiger had come from the Kadamba forest in Asifabad district and had sneaked into Tiryani areas.

Asifabad district is surrounded by wild forests belonging to Tadoba tiger reserve and Kawal wildlife sanctuary, which are home to several tigers that keep traveling for several kilometers from place to place in search of prey.

People in several villages around have been complaining about the movement of a tiger for the last few weeks.

Forest officials say the tiger that was spotted by the coal workers today could be the same one wandering around.
Videos and pictures of the rare sight have gone viral on social media. 

The forest officials say the tiger was first spotted drinking water at Gundala river under Rebbena block. They said they received information that a bull was killed by the tiger in the village later. There were reports that the tiger had killed a cow at Goleti open cast mines and another bull at Tumpalli village five days ago.

Forest officials have sounded an alert in the villages. People were advised against coming out of homes after sunset.

Last week, a leopard strayed into the human habitat at Katedan industrial area in Hyderabad. Forest officials could not capture the cub despite strenuous efforts for two days.
