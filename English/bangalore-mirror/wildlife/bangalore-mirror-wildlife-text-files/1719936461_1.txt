Bengaluru-Krishnagiri stretch proving dangerous to animals crossing Eastern Ghats 
 
 
 	It was a heartrending sight on the Bengaluru-Krishnagiri highway on Monday, as an adult elephant lay groaning on the road, having been injured after getting hit by a State Express Transport Corporation bus.
 	
 	  	The 10-year-old elephant, which was severely injured in the accident, fell on the ground, bringing the traffic on the busy road to a standstill.
 	
 	  	According to forest department officials, the elephant, along with a tusker, was trying to cross from Chettipalli Reserved Forest to Sanamavu Reserved Forest by crossing the highway.  	
 	
 	While the tusker escaped unhurt, the 10-year-old was injured and suffered a fracture on its hind leg. 
 	
 	  	The forest department officials reached the spot and the elephant was lifted using cranes and transported to Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary after being given first aid.
 	
 	  	Sanoop V, a techie who was on his way from his hometown in Kollam to Bengaluru, said, “I was on another bus and when I looked outside a large crowd had gathered around the injured elephant. All the buses plying in the area were trying to avoid the elephant and cross the accident spot.”
 	
 	  	This is turning out to be a hostile stretch for animals crossing the Eastern Ghats.
 	
 	  	The stretch is part of the common golden quadrilateral stretch between East-West and North-South corridors and cuts through the elephant corridor where pachyderms cross from the nearby Hosur forests and head towards the Kaudinya wildlife sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh.
 	  	
 	According to sources, more than 20 elephants have died in the region in about a year. While an elephant died of rash driving last year, seven other elephants were mowed down by a speeding train on the Bengaluru-Salem route near Kelamangalam.
