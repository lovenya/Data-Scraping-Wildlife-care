According to residents of area, Muninagara Dam near Bannerghatta forest is not able to retain water and so wild animals can easily walk into villages

Visitors to Muninagara Dam located on the outskirts of Bannerghatta forest have observed that the dam is structurally weak, leading to leaks.

According to them the leak has something to do with the lakebed now being visible. As the dam is unable to hold water, the lake bed is visible and can be accessed, allowing wildlife from the nearby Bannerghatta forest to pass through, villagers in the surrounding area claim.

A resident of Kaggalipura who recently visited the dam said that the lakebed around the dam is visible due to leakages. “The water is not retained due to the leaks. Since it is being drained out, the lake bed is visible,” he said.

Local villagers have also said that the dam’s structure has weakened, leaving them exposed to wildlife from the nearby Bannerghatta forest. The lake previously acted as a barrier between the village and forest, not allowing wildlife such as bears to cross through. However, since the water level has gone significantly low, to an extent where the lake bed is visible, villagers have reported to have spotted bears making their way into the village.

Both the visitors and villagers have urged authorities to restore the dam back to its functional state, as it would act as a source of water and also keep wildlife from wandering into nearby villages.
