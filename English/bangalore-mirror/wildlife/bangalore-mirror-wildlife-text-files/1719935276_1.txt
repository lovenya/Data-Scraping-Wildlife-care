 The city police have started a manhunt for a poacher, Nanjappa, from Kollegal in Chamarajanagar who deals with animal pelts. The action follows the confession from five poachers arrested by the CID Forest Cell squad near Thilaknagar. The sleuths had recovered a leopard skin from the five along with a bike and four mobile phones. 

 The police found out that the arrested obtained the leopard skin from Nanjappa, a notorious poacher, who along with his men hunted the leopard in the Male Mahadeshwara Hills in Kollegal. Following this information, city police have asked their Kollegal counterparts to find out if there are any cases registered against Nanjappa there. 

 	There is a possibility that Nanjappa could have killed more wild animals, an investigating officer said. 

 The CID sleuths, headed by sub inspector Lakshmi Narasimaiah, arrested the five poachers near Thilaknagar circle last week after getting a tip-off. The arrested are identified as Sunil, 24, of Mahalakshmi Layout, Alex, 41, Naveen, 21 and Sharath, 22, all residents of Thilaknagar and Surya Prakash, 22, of Wilson Garden. They were arrested when they were trying to sell the pelt to another poacher. The suspects were later handed over to the Thilaknagar police station for further questioning after they were booked under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act. 

 	It is also learnt that the arrested five had contacts with the locals in Kollegal who hunted wild animals, said an investigating officer. 

 	“We are ascertaining if there are any cases registered against the five suspects who have been arrested. We are also trying to find out the owner-details of the bike that was recovered. The animal skin has been sent to specialists,” the officer added.
