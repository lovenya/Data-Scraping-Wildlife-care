In a unique rescue of a jackal,with efforts, dedication and teamwork, the PFA Wildlife Rescue Centre managed to pull out an Indian jackal trapped 50 feet below the surface in a dry well in Doddaballapura forest. The dramatic rescue unfolded late in the evening on December 8, following a distress call from Doddaballapura forest officials.

Upon receiving the urgent plea, Colonel (Dr) Navaz Shariff, Chief Veterinarian of the PFA Wildlife Rescue Centre, acted swiftly, dispatching the Quick Reaction Rescue Team (QRRT) equipped with specialised rescue gear. Despite the 70-kilometre distance from their centre in Kengeri, the team, comprising dedicated individuals such as Rahul, Salman, Ashfak, and Anand GS, reached the location by 10 pm. Under the moonlight, the collaborative efforts between the rescue team and the forest department transformed into a tireless operation. The well was deep and posed a daunting challenge for the rescue, but with precision and care, the rescue team descended into the well, armed with climbing ropes, harnesses, catching nets, torches, and essential clothing. Navigating the darkness, they inched closer to the trapped Indian jackal, and they captured the jackal with care and without any harm.

Dr Shariff said, “ The jackal was trapped in the well for two days and when we got to know about the case we immediately rushed there. When we reached, we saw the jackal was extremely scared. Even during the rescue, it was scared and was trying to escape and it took some time for us to catch it with the nets. Had we been further delayed, the jackal could have reached the stage of dehydration and could have even died. But with timely rescue, it was saved. After the jackal was caught, we examined it and it was healthy and then we decided to release it in the forest.” The rescued Indian jackal was joyfully released back into its natural habitat, marking another triumph for Team PFA. This is so far the 11th rescue of jackals that have all been released successfully without any harm. This rescue is among the 38,000 animals saved by PfA, underscoring the importance of swift action in the critical moments of wildlife distress, showcasing their commitment to preserving and protecting Bengaluru’s diverse wildlife.

This rescue highlights the critical importance of swift and coordinated efforts in safeguarding the well-being of wildlife, showcasing the role organizations like PFA play in preserving the delicate balance of ecosystems and ensuring the survival of diverse species.
