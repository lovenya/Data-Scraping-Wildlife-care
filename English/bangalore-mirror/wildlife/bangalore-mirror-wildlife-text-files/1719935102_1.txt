Only your diarist got a look at this intimate moment between Prince Charles and Dr Issac Mathai of Soukya in Kerala at Taj Malabar, Kochi. The Prince spent over an hour with a group of 10, including Bangaloreans Jitu Virwani (Embassy Group), Chittiappa (BCK group), cardiologist Dr Raman Rao and Dr Abraham. The discussion centred on how integrated medicine can be taken forward. The Prince suggested that an institution be set up in Bangalore and London. We wonder if anyone asked him about his torrid time at the Vazhachal Rainforest in Kerala. If sloshing through the mud in suede shoes and a formal suit wasn’t hard enough, we hear he was left sorely disappointed by the absence of any wildlife — probably scared off by security. Next time, maybe!
 
 Bangalore calling
 Filmmaker Pawan Kumar was seen hobnobbing with Bangalore’s son-in-law, Vivek Oberoi, last evening. Kumar had arranged an exclusive screening of his latest, Lucia, on Oberoi’s special request, at the Renukamba Mini Theatre in Malleswaram. Apparently the actor had seen the film on a DVD (we laud wife Priyanka for attempting to make a Kannadiga out of him) and had wanted to see it on the big screen. Kumar and Oberoi had first met in Delhi last month and exchanged cards, so all it took was a phone call. Oberoi attended it with wife Priyanka, her brother Aditya, friends and other members from the Alva household. Last heard, Oberoi was animatedly discussing the possibilities of a new script with Kumar. Hopefully, we will soon see a Bangalore-Mumbai collaboration, Kumar told the diarist.
