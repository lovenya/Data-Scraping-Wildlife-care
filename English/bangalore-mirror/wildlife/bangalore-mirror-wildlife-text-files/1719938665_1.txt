With leopard showing no signs of surfacing, forest and wildlife officials have another headache now. A steady stream of fake news is doing the rounds on social media, hampering the search operations and causing unnecessary panic and confusion among citizens and authorities alike. 

A wildlife activist who has been assisting with the field operations said, "It is really tough to concentrate with so much fake news around. When we were combing the areas for the cat, we received a message saying that a few people were attacked at some place and when we verified the information, we got to know that it was not true. 
A forest official part of the operation said, "On Tuesday, we heard news saying that two leopards were killed in the area. 

We searched and checked with our sources but there was no confirmation. Fake news can disturb everyone as people become tense and this can also make the search operations difficult as one has to change their strategies." 

There was no luck on Tuesday in finding the leopard as none of the 10 camera traps set up could capture the wild cat. Forest personnel now suspect that the leopard could have migrated to another place. "Unless we get clues like pug marks, or information on attacking someone or killing an animal for food, we cannot conclude that the leopard is still there in that area," said an official. 

Meanwhile, a few residents of the apartments have taken to social media seeking information on the issue. "We have been scared for the last four days to even move out. Going out of the house for basic chores has become difficult. We have been hearing a lot of rumours and need clarity from forest personnel and other authorities so that we can feel safe again," said an 18-year-old.
