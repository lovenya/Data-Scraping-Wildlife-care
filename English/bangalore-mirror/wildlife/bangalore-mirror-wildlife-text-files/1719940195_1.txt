The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has issued an advisory urging all states and union territories to prohibit the use of harmful kite-flying threads, known as ‘manja’, under the Environment (Protection) Act (EPA), 1986. The advisory emphasises on the dangers posed by manja, particularly those coated with glass or metal, and advocates for the use of plain cotton string instead.

Despite the nationwide ban on manja, Karnataka continues to grapple with the sale and usage of these hazardous threads, leading to a significant number of injuries among both birds and humans. Colonel Dr. Nawaz Sharif, Chief veterinarian at People for Animals (PfA), expressed concern over the issue, stating, “It has been banned by the green tribunal for a long time.
 
The pollution control board has to enforce the ban effectively.” He emphasised on the need for stringent measures to address the root cause, advocating for a ban on manufacturing, sale, and possession of manja at all levels.

The statistics provided by PfA paint a grim picture of the consequences of manja usage. Colonel Sharif revealed that PfA receives at least 3-4 cases of bird injuries daily, totaling about 120-150 cases every month. Moreover, nearly 800 birds were rescued last year alone, many of which suffered severe injuries, including bone fractures, due to entanglement with manja.

The implications of manja extend beyond avian casualties, as humans attempting to rescue entangled birds often inadvertently cause further harm. PfA employs specialised equipment and techniques to minimise harm during rescue operations, but the need for proactive measures to prevent such incidents is evident.

 PfA is also involved in raising awareness about the dangers of manja, particularly among schoolchildren. Over 4 lakh students have pledged to refrain from using Chinese manja and crackers.

Subiksha Venkatesh, lead wildlife rehabilitator, ARRC, said, “The lethal glass-coated manja string remains the predominant cause of wild bird rescues in our city. Our team alone has rescued over 10,850 birds and bats from manja in Bengaluru in the past six years alone.
 
Despite the National Green Tribunal’s recognition of the threat mana poses to both human and non-human lives and its subsequent ban in 2016, effective implementation remains a challenge.
 
The manufacture, distribution, and sale of manja must be closely monitored and prohibited. Moreover, stringent measures should ensure that any kite-flying festivals utilise only eco-friendly materials, avoiding the use of manja altogether.”

Venkatesh added that imposing fines on individuals caught using the string would act as a deterrent. “Establishing a standardised reporting protocol for the manufacture and sale of manja would encourage public cooperation and enable organizations like ours to support authorities in confiscating the banned material.”
