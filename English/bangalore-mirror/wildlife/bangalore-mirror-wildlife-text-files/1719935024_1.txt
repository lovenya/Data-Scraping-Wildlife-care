Tiger reserves in Karnataka are set to become more secure as an NGO is building an all-weather camp for anti-poaching staff in Mysore. It is much better than the existing structures that are called anti-poaching camps (APCs) in terms of basic facilities.   The NGO hopes that the facilities will persuade forest staff to spend more time in the camp, named Aranyaka. Right now, they hardly use the APCs, let alone stay overnight, because of the lack of water supply and electricity. This affects tiger conservation and anti-poaching efforts.   The initiative for the model camp was taken by Mysore-based Voice for Wildlife (VW) to help tiger conservation and curb poaching. The structure was designed by Centre for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technologies (CREST) of National Institute of Engineering, Mysore.    The model camp was built in November last year. The 300 sq ft structure has a provision to harvest rainwater and solar power panels. It can be built within 10 days as against a month for the 200 sq ft APCs. The hitch is the cost, which comes to at least Rs 8 lakh while APCs can be built for Rs 3 lakh. The NGO is aiming to bring the cost down to Rs 6 lakh without compromising on strength. It plans to replace concrete, bricks and iron used in APCs with cellulose-based honeycomb concrete panels.    K S Sudheer, wildlife activist and managing trustee of Voice for Wildlife, told Mirror, “Since the use of iron, bricks and concrete comes down, and less time is taken for construction, the disturbance caused to wildlife is reduced. “
