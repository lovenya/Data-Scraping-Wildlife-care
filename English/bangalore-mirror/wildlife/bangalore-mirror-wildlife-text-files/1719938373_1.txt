Hyderabad: A baby leopard created panic among people in Katedan area in Hyderabad on Thursday.

Forest and zoo officials arrived at the Katedan under bridge and are trying to tranquilise it. The wild animal is suspected to have gone into a hideout in a nearby area with a large number of trees.

Forest officials deployed drone and trap cameras to spot the location it was hiding. The animal is said to have suffered an injury on its leg.

"It appears to be a two to three years old cub. We hope it will remain in the present location that is safe. We are trying to ensure that it does not come out to residential colonies," an official said.
 
Locals said the animal had attacked one person, identified as Subhan, a truck driver from East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh.

Initially, the animal was confused and remained lying at the road divider. While some from the surrounding residential complexes were amused, passersby were frightened. People said the animal was first spotted around 6 in the morning.

The Mylardevpally Police stopped the vehicular movement for some time.
