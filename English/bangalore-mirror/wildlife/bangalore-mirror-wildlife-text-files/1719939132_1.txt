When Amoghavarsha Patlapati hosted his first wildlife photo exhibition titled ‘Tales of Moghi’ at Karnataka Chitra Kala Parishat, the 14-year-old has come one step closer to realising his dream. The exhibition that began on June 1 and came to a close on June 5 featured more than 100 photographs clicked by Patlapati.
 
Patlapati told Bangalore Mirror he was seven, when he first took his camera to capture wild beasts. “When I was young, my parents used to take me to various forests.
 
There, I would observe all the wild animals. After that my mother started wildlife photography. Seeing her photographs, I was inspired and that’s how I started my journey as a wildlife photographer,” he said.

The one thing that wildlife photography taught him is patience, he says. “I understood that in order to be successful in this field, it is extremely important to learn the art of patience. And it is the key to success.”

His greatest achievement is that he has clicked more than 60,000 pictures of various wild species like tigers, leopards, birds, butterflies and the like. “Another feat is that I have set up a bird bath at my house which is home to 140 species of birds ranging from migratory birds to different endemic birds.” His photography has taken him to a number of national parks and forests like Nagarahole, Bandipur and Dandeli. “I was able to take a photograph of a blacak panther in Nagarahole and it was the only one left there,” he said.

The young photographer goes on these ventures alone. He says he is not afraid of the wild because it has been a part of his growing up. “I am used to seeing these animals from a young age. I feel they are an integral part of my life.” The idea of the exhibition was given to him by his parents. “I am overwhelmed at the response,” he said.
