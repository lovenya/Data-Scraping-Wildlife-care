Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor Khan broke all stereotypes during her pregnancy and after two months of her son Taimur Ali Khan’s birth, the diva is back to work. The actress, who became a mother on December 20, says that she is in the best phase of her life.

"I feel alive because I feel I am in the best phase of my life. I am a happy person and always look out for positivity," the Udta Punjab actress said on Wednesday at the launch ceremony of a channel.

Interestingly, she was four months pregnant with Taimur while shooting the advertisement for the channel. An elated Kareena said, “My son would be feeling alive when he will know about this fact.”

The actress has always been open about her life and never shied away from sharing her experience with her fans. Bebo candidly revealed that she and her husband Saif Ali Khan love watching television shows based on history, nature, wildlife and adventure.

Speaking about the same, she said, “I watch TV quite a lot whenever I get time, to unwind myself. Saif and I love watching adventurous shows together. Watching wildlife, the history and beauty of nature on screen make me feel alive.”

When asked her about her opinion on the trolling celebrities face on social media for expressing their opinion, she said, “I would rather watch TV at home and relax than express my opinion on everything and get trolled by people on social media. I am one of the actresses who is neither on Twitter, nor on Instagram.”

After two months post Taimur’s birth, the actress is back with a bang in her professional life. Bebo is currently prepping for her upcoming film Veere Di Wedding, which also stars Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar in pivotal roles.
