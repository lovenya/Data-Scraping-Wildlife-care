A stag was rescued late Friday night from inside a hotel near Rajarajeshwari Nagar by staff and volunteers from the Karnataka Forest Department. The mission that began at Krishna Gardens Layout in Rajarajeshwari Nagar ended with the stag being caught at a restaurant on the Uttarahalli-Kengeri stretch.

Residents of Krishna Gardens Layout had reported that a deer had taken refuge behind bushes on an empty site and had been struggling to get out for two days fearing the stray dogs that were attacking it. A rescue mission was attempted on Friday morning, but to no avail. After this, a team of 15 staff and 13 volunteers regrouped to capture the stag at night. 

Headed by Range Forest Officer (RFO) Gopal and Deputy Forest Range Officer (DRFO) Naveen, the team initially saw the panicked animal, but it escaped their attempts to catch it, and took off in the direction of the Uttarahalli-Kengeri Road. After a short chase, the deer barged into a restaurant. It entered the dining area, where two volunteers, Dileep and Manjunath, held on to the animal and contributed to a successful operation.

Joseph Hoover, former member of the State Wildlife Board and Convener of the United Conservation Movement, said the stag was chased out of the forest by feral dogs. “Feral dogs regularly hunt and kill deer in the forest. Almost 14 deer have been lost to their preying. Sometimes, the deer crash into vehicles too,” he says. Hoover suggested that the solution was for the Forest Department to capture the dogs and release them elsewhere.
