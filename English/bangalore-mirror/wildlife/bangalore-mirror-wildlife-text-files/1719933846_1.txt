Kidney transplant surgeon and amateur photographer, Dr Ajit K Huilgol has made not just Bangalore but the whole country proud. This is not a medical feat we are talking about but a creative one. A passionate wildlife photographer, who spends a large part of his free time scoring forests and wildlife sanctuaries, camera in hand, Huilgol has bagged the runner up award in the prestigious Veolia Environment Wildlife Photographer of the Year Competition 2009 organised by the Natural History Museum, London and the BBC’s ‘Wildlife’ magazine. 

His achievement was even more commendable because the competition had received as many as 43,000 entries from 94 countries and Huilgol was the only Indian whose work was considered. “I was the only Indian here and from the information that I have received from the organisers, I’m only the fourth Indian to ever feature since the inception of the BBC awards,” an elated Huilgol told Bangalore Mirror from London, where the function to give away the awards was held a couple of days ago. 

The photograph that won the award in the ‘Behaviour: Mammals category’ is titled ‘Leopard Descending’ and was shot when a female leopard was climbing down a tree. In a rare sighting, Huilgol spotted the animal sitting on the high branch of a tree while he was driving down a narrow track in the Nagarhole National Park and shot the animal for almost 20 minutes. 

“This is the Nobel Prize of wildlife photography and that is why an honour for me and the country. I hope this award inspires more Indians to take part in this competition in future,” Huilgol, who is consultant transplant surgeon at the Columbia Asia Hospital in the city, added.  All the winning and runner-up entries are currently on display at the Natural History Museum.
