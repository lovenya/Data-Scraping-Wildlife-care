NGT notice to state forest dept as massive 12,850 sq km loss of green cover in Cauvery basin

The National Green Tribunal has served notice to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Karnataka Forest Department after a massive drop in area under green cover in the Cauvery basin over the past five decades was highlighted by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science.

The suo motu notice was taken up by the tribunal citing a news item based on the IISc report, which revealed that natural vegetation on nearly 12,850 sq km of land in the Cauvery basin was lost in the last 50 years (from 1965 to 2016).

Notices in this regard have also been issued to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC), Forest Survey of India (FSI), southern zone Bengaluru, PCCF of Kerala Forest Department and PCCF of Tamil Nadu Forest Department.

“…Karnataka has lost much more than any other state in the basin. As per the said report, the natural vegetation cover went down by around 46% in these years. It has been opined that the quantum of reduction of dense vegetation was 35% (6,123 sq km) and that of degraded vegetation was 63% (6,727 sq km). As per the said report, areas that suffered adverse changes in the extent of forest cover include Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandipur National Park, Nagarhole National Park, and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,” noted the order.

As per the IISc report, between 1965 and 2016, natural vegetation cover in the basin reduced from 28,194 sq km to 15,345 sq km. Across administrative divisions, Karnataka lost about 57% of the vegetation cover in the basin, Tamil Nadu lost 29% and Kerala lost 27%.

The land use analysis by IISc researchers also revealed the catchment is dominated by agricultural activities. While 73.5% of the area was found to be under agriculture and horticulture, 18% was forest cover, 3.65% was built-up area and 1.42% was area under water.
 
District-wise forest dynamics of the state showed while Hassan, Mandya, and Tumkuru have lost over 70% of the forest cover in the catchment over the past five decades, Chamarajnagar recorded the lowest forest loss (22%). The district had 2,351 sq km of area under forests in 1966 and it went down to 1,832 sq km in 2016.

In the report, researchers noted that unabated deforestation, global warming, and water vulnerability are major threats to the sustenance of water availability in the Cauvery basin.
