Hundreds of people from Tamil Nadu attacked and ransacked the Karnataka forest department's checkpost at Palar, linking Salem in Tamil Nadu, on Friday after a poacher was allegedly killed by Karnataka forest officials. The border post comes under the Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary division. 

 	The flash point for the attack was the mysterious death of a poacher whose body was found in the Palar river, a tributary of Cauvery, on Friday morning. The checkpost was set ablaze by the mob from the other side of the border. No injuries were reported. Sources in the Karnataka forest department revealed that a patrol party led by range forest officer Madhusoodhan was patrolling in the MM Hills range when they noticed the movement of poachers. 

 	“The poachers had hunted two sambhars and were in the process of fleeing. They opened fire on us when asked to surrender. Our staff retaliated and the poachers fled. We have seized meat of sambhar and equipment used for hunting,” said a senior forest official attached to Palar range. Another forest official told BM that while escaping, a few poachers sustained injuries and one, unable to cross the Palar, drowned.
