Six-foot cobra had taken refuge in this family’s tiny house when they were away; timely alert by neighbour saved them 	

  	A family of three including an 8-year-old child had a close shave as a 6-foot cobra was rescued from their tiny house of 9X4 feet on Thursday. The family of Suresh, Rajamma and Sunil, 8, had gone to Mysore and returned on Wednesday evening. When neighbours told them they had seen a snake sneaking in on Monday night, they opted to stay with the neighbour rather than open their house. 

 They called the BBMP wildlife rescue team on Thursday and found to their horror a six-foot cobra inside which could have proved deadly had they encountered it. The snake was rescued from the house of Suresh S - Rajamma couple in Srirampura behind Mantri Mall. 

 	“We were fortunate that nothing untoward happened,” Rajamma told Bangalore Mirror. “Somehow, we foresaw the danger and slept in our neighbouring house. Today was a big shock.’’ The strangest element in the rescue was that the family spent Thursday morning from 6.30 am to 9 in their tiny house without spotting the cobra. They carried out their normal activities. 

 “The cobra was found in the kitchen top. Though it won’t attack anybody, the place was so small and the cobra was a huge one, and this was a cause of concern. However, it was rescued and released immediately. As the place is close to a green patch and railway track, the cobra may have sneaked from there,” Mahesh Kumar, BBMP wildlife volunteer, told Bangalore Mirror. 

 	Rajamma, however, said she was still scared. “We have a small child and it is difficult even to imagine what could have been the consequence had it attacked.’’
