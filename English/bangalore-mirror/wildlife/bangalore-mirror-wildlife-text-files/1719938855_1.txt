Rotary District 3190 — part of Rotary, a century-old, global organisation — is collaborating with the forest department to conduct a photography contest, titled, ‘Malgudi All India Photography Salon 2021’. The organisers will be hosting a webinar on October 20 at 4 pm for the participants of the contest, that aims to promote wildlife conservation.

The programme is recognised by FIP and its organisers will be donating proceeds from the contest towards the development of forest infrastructure to prevent conflict between wild animals and human beings.
