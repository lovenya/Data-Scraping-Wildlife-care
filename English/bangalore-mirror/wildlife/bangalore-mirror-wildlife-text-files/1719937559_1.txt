The scene was unusual: Two male Great Hornbills were engaged in a deadly fight at the Hornbill River Resort in Ganeshgudi, Dandeli, on top of a tree. But the fight ended with one of them getting gravely injured. GE Umesh, a witness to the fight and owner of the resort, rushed to the rescue of the injured hornbill and drove to Dharwad Veterinary Hospital, 90 km away, along with forest officers, to get the bird treated.

GE Umesh, who is a wildlife photographer, says, “This is the first time I have seen the fight between two hornbills in my resort. I was clueless at first but when I saw it injured near the neck and fallen. The other hornbill was rescued and was in a good condition. I took the help of forest officers and gave first aid to the injured one. We did an X-Ray before rushing it to the veterinary clinic as it is quite far. In the X-Ray we found that there were no fractures in its wings. We covered it in a white cloth and took it then to the hospital where it was treated by Dr. AS Patil.” 

Of the nine species of hornbills found in India, Hornbill River resort has four that include Indian Grey hornbill, Malabar Pied Hornbill, the Great Hornbill an the Malabar Grey Hornbill.
