The bird from Himalayas visits Bangalore just twice a year
 
 Residents of Shriram White House apartments in R T Nagar took care of a rare guest from the Himalayas, who visits Bangalore just twice a year — a migratory bird famous among city bird watchers as the Indian Pitta. It is also known as Navarangi for its nine-coloured feathers. 

 	On Tuesday, the residents helped an injured Pitta, which could have otherwise fallen prey to other birds or animals. The bird is usually spotted during its flight from the foothills of Himalayas to southern parts of the country and neighbouring Sri Lanka. 

 	“My husband and I were coming back to our house when we saw the beautiful little bird. 
 	  	Our apartment’s security guards were trying to give it water. I immediately asked my husband to stop the car and jumped to help the little bird. As I touched him, he was terrified. 
 	  	I could feel he was exhausted and tired,” educationist Indu Ganesh, an apartment resident, told Bangalore Mirror. 

 The semi-adult Pitta was initially taken to be a Barbet or Bee-eater by Indu. She wrapped the bird in her dupatta and carried him home. “I called CUPA, who in turn directed me to contact the BBMP wildlife rescue team. I googled and found more about this wonderful bird,” she said.
 	  	BBMP wildlife volunteer Kiran Kumar D S rushed to the spot, rescued the bird and sent it to the Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Bannerghatta. It will be released once it recovers from injury. “Kiran confirmed the bird was indeed the rare Indian Pitta. We were thrilled as the bird was with us for some time before it reached safe hands. I was fortunate that I got an opportunity to do this little service,” she added.
