Don’t go near transformers, don’t touch wires: BESCOM’s cautionary note to citizens

Don’t be surprised if you spot Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) personnel going around the streets, announcing to people to be careful about not going near transformers or touching wires. During the rainy season in the city, there is an increased risk of electrocution, prompting BESCOM personnel to take precautionary measures.
 
BESCOM MD Mahantesh Bilagi stressed the importance of safety, stating, “Don’t touch transformers or wires. When there is rainfall, people should be careful not to go near or touch electric wires and poles; it could lead to electrocution. Hence, as we don’t want this to happen, we have taken up a regular campaign.”

An official said that to ensure public safety during the monsoon, BESCOM officials are even reaching out to schools to educate students and their families on how to safeguard themselves.
 
“We are advising residents to avoid going close to any electricity poles or lines that may be in dangerous conditions and to immediately call BESCOM’s 24x7 helpline (1912) if they come across any issues,” they added.

Apart from power outage alerts, BESCOM vans are also deployed to specific areas during maintenance or transformer repair work, which may result in long power cuts.

An official from BESCOM said that over the past two years, they have employed BESCOM vans to proactively inform residents in specific areas about power outages.
 
“This initiative was especially crucial during the challenging period of the covid-19 pandemic, when many people were working from home. Unlike traditional office setups, numerous households lacked power backup systems, making them vulnerable to prolonged power disruptions. During this time, BESCOM had to conduct maintenance and transformer repair work in certain areas, which could result in extended power cuts,” they explained.

To minimise inconvenience and keep the public informed, the BESCOM vans were deployed with microphones to reach out to households and businesses directly. The announcements made through the microphones served as timely alerts, enabling residents to plan their work and daily activities accordingly.

The need for such proactive communication was vital, as prolonged power cuts could have severe implications for individuals working from home, hindering their productivity and affecting their overall work plan. Through these efforts, BESCOM aimed to bridge the communication gap, they informed.
 
However, some residents have expressed dissatisfaction with BESCOM’s monsoon preparedness. They believe it is the duty of BESCOM personnel to clear branches hovering around electric lines to prevent power supply disruptions during heavy rainfall or winds.

One resident from Bhuvaneswari Nagar shared his experience, stating, “When I requested them to clear a few branches of honge trees, the personnel said it was not possible for him to do so. This selective approach doesn’t work.”

Meanwhile, BESCOM officials said that they are working on replacing existing bare overhead lines that cross over elephant habitats with covered conductor/LT AB cable in various locations.
 
This initiative aims to create a safe corridor for elephants and other animals, demonstrating BESCOM’s commitment to both public safety and wildlife conservation.
