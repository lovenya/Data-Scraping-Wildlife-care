Number of tigers has gone up in country, but data shows dip in tiger occupancy throughout Western Ghats, with a few exceptions such as in Anshi-Dandeli area 

Though the tiger numbers in the country have gone up, their numbers are going down outside the protected areas (PA). According to the 2023 tiger census report released on Sunday, there has been a 6.3% increase in the tiger population in the country, with a total of 3,167 tigers. This is a significant increase from the 1,411 tigers recorded in 2006, 1,706 in 2010, 2,226 in 2014, and 2,967 in 2018. However, the state-wide tiger census report was not announced on Sunday, and sources suggest it may be released on World Tiger Day (July 29). 

The bad news
The report stated that the Nilgiri cluster, which spans from Nagarahole to BRT Hills in the Western Ghats, is the world’s largest tiger population and has played a significant role in the expansion of tiger populations in neighbouring areas. However, recent data indicates a decline in tiger occupancy throughout the Western Ghats, with a few exceptions such as the Anshi-Dandeli area. While tiger populations within protected areas have remained stable or increased, tiger occupancy outside of these areas has declined, particularly in the Wayanad and BRT Hills landscapes.

Increase in Anshi-Dandeli
According to the 2022 Status of Tigers report, tiger occupancy has increased in the Anshi-Dandeli landscape’s eastern portion but declined in the border areas of Goa and Karnataka’s Mollem-Mhadei-Anshi Dandeli complex. The Mookambika-Sharavathi-Sirsi landscape has seen a significant decline in tiger occupancy, while the Bhadra landscape has remained stable. Additionally, tiger occupancy has declined outside of the Periyar landscape, and local extinctions have been observed in Sirsi, Kanyakumari, and Srivilliputhur.

Best protected areas
While the Western Ghats boasts some of the best-protected area connectivity in the country, increasing human development and footprints are leading to a rise in the interface between humans and wildlife. Although wildlife in human-dominated landscapes is culturally significant, there is a growing tension between humans and mega herbivores and carnivores. Addressing this issue is crucial if we are to preserve one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. The spread of invasive species is also a major concern in the Western Ghats, with large tracts of protected areas being affected. It is necessary to contain this spread to ensure the survival of native flora and, subsequently, to reduce its impact on fauna, soil, and habitat as a whole.

Unique tigers
According to the report, the Western Ghats region contains some of the most biodiverse protected areas in the country. However, the increasing development in the region has resulted in a growing overlap between wildlife and humans. In 2018, the tiger population in the region was estimated to be 981, but in 2022, only 824 unique tigers were recorded, indicating a decline in some regions and stability in well-protected tiger reserves. To safeguard the indigenous flora and the ecosystem as a whole, invasive species must also be contained.

Tiger estimation
The fifth cycle of the All India Tiger Estimation (2022) involved surveying forested habitats in 20 states of India. A foot survey covering 6,41,449 km was conducted to estimate carnivore signs and prey abundance. 
In addition, 3,24,003 habitat plots were sampled for vegetation, human impacts, and ungulate dung. Camera traps were set up at 32,588 locations, resulting in a staggering 4,70,81,881 photographs, out of which 97,399 were of tigers. The survey required a total effort of over 6,41,102 man-days, making it the largest wildlife survey conducted to date in terms of all the above counts.

Challenges galore
Despite conservation efforts, there remain several challenges in the preservation of tigers. A significant issue is balancing the need for large-scale economic development with the protection of forests and their wildlife, as well as addressing human-tiger conflict. Additionally, climate change is impacting habitats and leading to the degradation of forest quality. 
Of the approximately 4,00,000 sq km of forests in tiger states, only one-third are in relatively good condition. Illegal wildlife trade is another critical challenge, as poaching continues to occur due to high demand for tiger products. 
Despite the illegality of such activities, poachers still kill tigers for profit.
