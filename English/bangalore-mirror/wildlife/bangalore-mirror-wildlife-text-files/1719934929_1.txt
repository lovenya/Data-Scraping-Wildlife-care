In the first recorded case of its kind in the city this year, a grey slender loris used for black magic, which had its left arm slashed, was rescued by wildlife sleuths. According to them, three such cases are recorded on an average every year.    The creature’s limb had turned gangrenous and had to be amputated. After a month of treatment and training to use its remaining arm to feed itself, the little primate was released last week into a conducive habitat.   “The slender loris rescued was on the verge of death as its left limb was badly damaged. These creatures are used in black magic rites. The superstitious belief is that if a body part of the slender loris (in this case the left arm) is damaged, the same body part of the targeted person will get affected,” C Kishan, manager, People For Animals, Bangalore, told Bangalore Mirror.    The slender loris was spotted at a farm house in Nelamangala, and the PFA staff were alerted on May 14.   These nocturnal primates were found in good numbers around Bangalore a decade ago, but their numbers have fallen since. They are usually to be seen in Huliyaldurga, Devarayandurga, Ramanagaram and Ujjaini.    The tiny creatures are also in demand for their skin which is used to make high-end purses and bags. Keeping them is also considered to bring good fortune.    These ‘practices’ make the slender loris an animal in much demand in the illegal wildlife trade. Possessing a slender loris, which is accorded the highest protection in schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act along with animals like the Asian elephant, the snow leopard and the Royal Bengal tiger, amounts to a violation of the Act, punishable with a jail term of up to five years.
