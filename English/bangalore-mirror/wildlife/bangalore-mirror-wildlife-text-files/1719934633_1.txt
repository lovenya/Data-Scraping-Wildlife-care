Fearless Charlie Parker looks far from rattled as he comes face-to-face with a 10kg snake. While the youngster's legs may wobble under the weight of Pablo — a 2.5m boa constrictor — the enormous reptile holds no fears for him.   At just two-years-old, the pint-sized animal lover is already an expert snake wrangler and is laying claim to being Australia's youngest wildlife ranger. Charlie comes from a long line of animal lovers who own and run the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria.   Proud dad and park owner Greg Parker said ,“We're still shocked by his natural ability with the animals. It's quite remarkable to watch — he has absolutely no fear of them and he doesn't just handle them, he also has the knowledge. ”
