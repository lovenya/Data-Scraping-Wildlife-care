Residents of Seshadripuram had some rare visitors on Friday morning, who held their attention for more than an hour. The guests, two colourful peahens that suddenly emerged out of nowhere, hoppedfromonebuildingtoanother, before disappearing from the residents’ sight. 
 
 Raj Reddy, a BANGALORE MIRROR reader and a yoga instructor, first spotted them on a building near Seshadripuram Composite Pre University College. Reddy, who was surprised at the sight of the playful birds in the bustling area, “tried to call the wildlife rescuers, but the birds had disappeared by then”.
 
 “I was sitting in the second floor of my building at around 10.30 am, when I saw the birds on the terrace of another building. They were hopping from one building to another. It was amazing to see them unfazed by the noise and the traffic,” Reddy told Bangalore Mirror. 
 
 Reddy said one peahen appeared out of nowhere on the terrace of a building, while the other flew down within minutes. “They seemed blissfully unaware of the noise around them and hopped around,” said some of the residents who saw them in action. 
 
 According to experts, these birds are mostly found in green patches in and around the city, including the GKVK campus, Hesarghatta, Byalkere and Bannerghatta, from where they could have flown in. Though they were found in nearby IISC campus in the past, they are rarely found now. 
 
 Some experts suspect they might have escaped from wildlife traders. “These birds may have flown in from the GKVK campus. They usually fly during nights and may have arrived in Seshadripuram during such a stunt. They are very sensitive and it is unlikely they would visit a busy area during the day. We can’t rule out an illegal wildlife trade for which the birds may havebeenbroughtandkeptincaptivity. They might have escaped from them. An investigation will reveal more,” said Arun Namdar, an expert on birds.
