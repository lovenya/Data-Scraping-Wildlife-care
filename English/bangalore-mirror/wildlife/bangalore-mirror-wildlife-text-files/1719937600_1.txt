The death of Ranga, a 46-year-old elephant from the Mathigodu elephant camp at Nagarahole, after being hit by a private bus during the early hours of Monday has forced Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to clarify his stand on permitting night traffic in forest zones. 

The Chief Minister said that he was deeply hurt by the death of Ranga and maintained that he was not in favour of allowing night traffic in the forest zones. 

A meeting will be held soon with the environmentalists, public and officials so that the wildlife is protected, he said.

In August this year, environmentalists were upset after the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) proposed lifting of night ban through the forests of Bandipur Tiger Reserve with some improvements and improvisations including construction of four elevated corridors of a km length each. The ministry claimed that the elevated corridor will provide passage below for the movement of animals and on stretches where the highway is not elevated, the plan is to install an eight high fence and restrict the entry of animals. A similar road structure was recommended for Waynad stretch of the Highway in Kerala too.

Bandipur Tiger Reserve is notified as a core critical tiger habitat under the Wildlife Protection Act and such critical tiger habitats should not be violated. Many see a strong Kerala lobby and fear that this stretch would be used to transport illegal sand, granite and livestock.
