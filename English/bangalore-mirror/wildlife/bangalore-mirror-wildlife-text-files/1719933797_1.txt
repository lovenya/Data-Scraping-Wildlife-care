Nagavara lake, off Hebbal Ring Road, is a place frequented by families who go on boat-rides in its placid waters. But Tuesday’s incident is sure to ‘terrify’ them as a fisherman netted a crocodile in the lake.

Fortunately, there were no visitors moving around Lumbini Gardens, a park developed around the lake. Besides, the croc fell into the net before it cause any damage.

The fisherman alerted BBMP forest cell’s environment advisor R Sharath Babu. Subsequently, the trapped ‘marsh’ crocodile, which was two feet in length, was shifted to the Bannerghatta National Park.

Even as onlookers and authorities heaved a sigh of relief, the question that is haunting everyone is: How did the marsh crocodile, that is normally found in the upstream of rivers, find its way into the lake?

RICH ‘DITCH’

Wildlife activists came up with a different theory. They felt the crocodile would not have found its way on its own. Instead, it must’ve been abandoned there. “There are a lot of farm houses owned by the affluent class on the outskirts. Some of them have private ponds and they secretly rear animals, including crocodiles, star tortoises, monitor lizards and foxes.”

“When the farm owners realise the threat from these animals are high or the cost of maintaining them is high, they abandon them. They leave these crocodiles into the nearest water bodies,” said an activist.

FIRST SIGHTING

This is not the first such incident in the city. Two years ago, a crocodile was found in Bellandur lake. It was rehabilitated in Lalbagh lake for a few days before it was shifted to Bannerghatta. Another giant crocodile was recovered from a college on Hosur Road. A few years ago, sleuths from CID forest cell raided a farm house close to the city and rescued over 40 crocodiles which were native to the Brazilian forests.
