Litter poses immediate risks of accidents, and damages environment and health in long run

In the midst of efforts to build roads using plastic, there’s an unfortunate trend emerging: some roads are turning into dumping grounds for plastic waste. A glaring example is the Bengaluru-Mangaluru highway. Despite its scenic beauty, this highway is marred by the sight of plastic litter strewn everywhere. During windy days, these plastic covers and debris pose a hazard to motorists, and can even potentially cause accidents.

Several spots along this highway, including Nelamangala, Solur, Thippasandra, Kunigal bypass, Yediyur, and Channarayapatna, are particularly affected by plastic dumping. While travelers contribute to the problem by littering, locals also add to the issue by discarding plastic waste on the roads. A majority of the discarded plastic consists of liquor packets. With numerous bars along the highway, many individuals consume liquor from these single-use plastic sachets and cups, then discard them on the roadside. Local resident Anuradha Kumari expressed concern. “Despite there being a ban on single-use plastic and restrictions on plastic production, it’s disheartening to see the lack of effective implementation,” she said.

Locals are calling for stricter measures to tackle illegal liquor sales, which often contribute to the plastic waste problem. In response, Magadi Tahsildar Surendra Murthy said, “Efforts are underway to address the plastic waste problem. We have instructed government offices to refrain from using plastic glasses, plates, and other disposable items. I will instruct officials to inspect the affected areas and take appropriate action.”

Shree Kumar, an activist, emphasised that plastic waste poses a significant threat to our environment, impacting ecosystems, wildlife, and human health in profound ways. He cautioned that when plastic items are discarded irresponsibly, they often find their way into natural habitats and once in these environments, plastics undergo a process of degradation that can take hundreds of years, leaching harmful chemicals into the soil and water. “Plastic pollution alters ecosystems by disrupting food chains and habitats, ultimately endangering biodiversity. In forests and urban areas, plastic litter contaminates soil and water sources, posing risks to plant life and wildlife. Animals may become entangled in plastic debris, leading to injuries, suffocation, and reduced mobility,” he said.

He elaborated on how as plastics break down into microplastics, they become more easily ingested by organisms throughout the food chain, including humans, potentially exposing us to harmful toxins and chemicals. According to him, the environmental impact of plastic waste extends beyond immediate harm to ecosystems and wildlife. 

Climate change
“Plastic pollution contributes to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases during production, incineration, and decomposition processes. Moreover, the extraction and processing of fossil fuels, which are used to produce plastics, further exacerbate carbon emissions and environmental degradation. We must prioritise waste reduction, promote sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics, and invest in waste management infrastructure. By collectively taking action to reduce plastic pollution, we can safeguard our planet’s precious ecosystems,” he said.
