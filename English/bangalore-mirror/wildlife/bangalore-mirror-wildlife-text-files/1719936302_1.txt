Due to their proximity to Bengaluru, the two forests saw more than half the visitors to 20 national parks and sanctuaries in 2014-15 
 
 
 In an incident reported from Karkala of Udupi district, two bundles of Economics answer scripts of the ongoing second-year pre-university examination were found on the roadside near Moodabidiri, but later handed over to the authorities concerned.
 
 Speaking to Bangalore Mirror of the March 16 incident, RB Nayak, deputy director of the pre-university board, Udupi, said, “Generally, answerscripts are sent to the nearest post office and from there they are dispatched to the respective destinations by RMS (railway mail service) Mangaluru.”
 
 According to sources, the education department had handed over the bundles to the postal department in Karkala. However, when the bundles reached RMS Mangaluru, two bundles were found missing. Immediately, a case was registered. The bundles had reportedly fallen onto the road when they were being transported in a bus from Karkala to Mangaluru. Luckily, a person found them and handed the bundles over to the Moodabidri police station. PU department officials, who were informed of the find, made arrangements for the bundles to be sent to Mangaluru.
 
 Nayak said, “The answerscripts are all safe and there is no need to panic. We have got a confirmation from Mysuru in this regard. We have asked the postal department for an explanation on their lapse. In addition, we also directed one postal staff to escort the bundles on their journey from Karkala to Mangaluru.”
