The fourth cycle of the All India Tiger Estimation 2018, results of which were declared to the nation on Global Tiger Day last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has now entered the Guinness World Record for being the world's largest camera trap wildlife survey.

Terming the achievement a great moment, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said that it is a shining example of "Atmanirbhar Bharat".

Further, the Environment Minister said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has fulfilled its resolve to double the tiger numbers four years before the target. The country now has an estimated 2,967 tigers as per the latest census.

With this number, India is home to nearly 75 per cent of the global tiger population and has already fulfilled its resolve of doubling tiger numbers, made at St Petersburg in 2010, much before the target year of 2022.

It adds, "In total, the camera traps captured 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife, 76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna. From these photographs, 2,461 individual tigers were identified using stripe-pattern-recognition software."

The 2018 "Status of Tigers in India" assessment also conducted extensive foot surveys that covered 522,996 km of trails and sampled 317,958 habitat plots for vegetation and prey dung.
