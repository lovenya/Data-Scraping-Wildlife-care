The soaring heat prior to onset of full-blown summer in the country, is taking a toll on wildlife. In order to keep themselves hydrated, animals often throng to water sources, located at perilous spots. In one such incident in Mysuru, three elephants—a mother and her calves—fell into a water reservoir near Chelavara village at Virajpet taluk in Kodagu district.

The pachyderms had strayed towards the water body to quench their thirst, when they accidentally slipped. And the trio was unable to escape due to the tank’s depth.

The tank is constructed inside a coffee plantation and rescue officials had to dig around the reservoir in order to help the animals move out. The good news is, the elephants have been rescued and released back into the forest.
