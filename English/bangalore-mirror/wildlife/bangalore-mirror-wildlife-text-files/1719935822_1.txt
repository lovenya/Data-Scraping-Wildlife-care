For AY Kamble, who works as deputy range forest officer at Dandeli Range of Anshi Tiger Reserve, Saturday was a special day. All the hard work he put into his job was finally recognised when he was bestowed with the Wildlife Service Award at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as part of the felicitation for forest staff, an event organised by Engrades Cricket Club (affiliated to the Karnataka State Cricket Association) in collaboration with The Times Foundation and Cycle Agarbatti.
 
 The event was part of the ‘Save the Tiger Cup’, which had 12 schools spreading awareness on forest and tiger conservation through cricket matches. Former Indian cricketer Sandeep Patil, all-rounder Roger Binny and fast bowler Varun Aaron participated in the event.
 
 After being bestowed with the award, Kamble, 45, said, “I did my work with complete dedication and not with an aim to get noticed or win awards. But today, all the work I did for the past 13 years got appreciation. I am proud and very happy to tell my children about my achievement at this age.”
 
 Kamble was awarded for his meritorious service in wildlife conservation. He was also awarded `1 lakh as a part of the cricket tournament, under the banner of Cricketers For Wildlife Conservation.
 
 This campaign was initiated by Patil, who is also an avid wildlife enthusiast. Concerned over the dwindling population of tigers, Patil encouraged cricketers to take up the issue.
 
 The awards for best bowler and batsman were also given on Saturday. The movement, which began in 2012, has gained a lot of ground.
 
 Apart from Bengaluru, the event will be held in Mysuru, Hubballi and Shivamogga later this year to spread the conservation message.
