A city photography exhibition on the elements will help conserve the country’s sloth bear population
 
 Twenty years ago, friends Sandesh Kadur and Kartick Satyanarayan sat on a tree in the Bannerghatta forest, swinging their legs. Minutes later, a leopard walked underneath them, in full view on that moonlit night. “I never forgot that moment,” Kadur says. On August 22, the duo will come together in a collaboration of sorts. National Geographic Explorer Kadur, award-winning photographer and filmmaker, will exhibit his latest show Elements of Nature at UB City. Part of proceeds from the show which will go to Satyanarayanan’s Wildlife SOS, an organisation dedicated to help conserve India’s wildlife. Among Wildlife SOS’s pet projects are the rescue and rehabilitation of India’s sloth bears or ‘dancing bears’.
 
 Kadur and Satyanarayanan say an image can connect urban citizens – “often disconnected from wildlife,” – to animals and the cause. “This exhibition is a way of directly connecting people to an actual cause, so that they can take the next step and actually participate in conservation,” Kadur explains.
 
 It’s a cause close to Satyanarayanan’s heart, one he took up in 1995 after being “obsessed with wildlife since childhood,” taking every opportunity he got to “head to the forest”. After a two-and-a-half-year stint with the New York Zoological Society on a project in India, which took him to Nagarhole, Bandipur, Kanha, Pench, Kaziranga and more, he realised that the country’s biodiversity wagon would derail soon if people didn’t take action. “If you don’t try to make a difference, you’re no different from a rodent in a sewer which eats, reproduces and dies,” he says. It was then that he came across the phenomenon of dancing bears – a form of cheap entertainment that was cruel to the bear and was illegal. A two-year-long investigation led him to discover that 1,200 such bears were being exploited across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and more. “A community called the Kalandars had entered India from Persia and would entertain the harem of Mughal emperors with performances using monkeys, owls and bears. Over time, the practice had become a cheap trick at tourist places,” he says. It led to the poaching of cubs, their moms being killed and their body parts being harvested for traditional Chinese medicine and aphrodisiac preparations.
 
 But simply arresting these people was not a solution, because 3,000 families depended on these bears for their livelihood, a fact even the government acknowledged when they approached them. In 1995, Satyanarayanan and his colleague decided to go it on their own, selecting a place near the Taj Mahal for a pilot project. “I didn’t know then that I’d spent the next 20 years on it! It took us three years to raise 10,000 to register the organisation,” he recalls. Realising that they needed to empower the community – which was earning as little on Rs 30 on some days, not educating their women and subsisting on an illegal livelihood – rather than exhorting them to give up the animals, he began visiting them and talking to them about their dreams.

 “Not all of them – the youngsters, especially – wanted to continue like this. Some told us they could learn how to drive and become drivers; others wanted to sell cattle fodder; start a dhaba; a kirana shop and so on,” he says. Years of convincing later – “sometimes they would chase us with axes and knives because they feared we were taking away their livelihood – we set up a bank account, raised through private support, and found one guy a job as an autorickshaw driver,” Satyanarayanan says.
 
 “When he started making Rs 270 a day, he was delirious and gave up his bear voluntarily. Word spread, and rest of the community agreed to also.”
 
 Today, using the same principle of “teach them how to fish rather than give them a fish”, they have sent 1,860 schoolchildren from the community to school, and importantly, got them to send the girls to school instead of having them married off at 11 as they did. “We then use the girl’s freedom to teach her life and job skills – from handicraft making to carpet making etc.” And the bonus was the rescue and rehabilitation of 628 bears between 2002-2014.
 
 Naturally, Kadur, who places conservation at the centre of his photography, believes in the cause deeply. Last August, he was at a bear rescue centre in Kashmir, has worked in collaboration with the forest department for 10 years, and filmed them. “I love bears. All of us should,” he says simply, launching into a description of their uniqueness. “They eat termites and insects, and have a specialised muscle that has been evolutionarily designed to eat termites from the ground. Most other bears have shorter hair, but sloth bears have shaggy hair and long claws. There are so many stories about them that make them a cool and different animal.”
 
 Satyanarayanan says they will use the proceeds from the art show to work on the rescue and repatriation of bears along the Indo-Nepal border, monitor that the Kalandar community doesn’t lapse back, and fund some projects. Like setting up an education centre for school kids in the city, who are so disconnected that when you ask them where milk comes from, they say a ‘carton’. He also hopes to work on their bear denning research study. “There’s increasing human-wildlife conflict. We hear of bear attacks because people went too close to the dens. Often, these dens are very shallow, and serve different purposes – there are cubbing dens, resting dens, nocturnal dens and day dens,” he explains. The plan is to set up camera traps around the den areas, study at what age cubs become vulnerable and give people an advisory so that they avoid going near these areas.
 
 They also want to use unmanned aerial vehicles to document habitat where there’s conflict and poaching.
 
 
 
 As Satyanarayanan puts it, nature is “shockingly awesome” and deserves respect and kindness. The exhibition, which will feature 25-30 photographs with one section dedicated to the elements of nature – air, water, fire and earth – and another of black and white panoramic images, fits perfectly into his premise. Although the show was conceptualised a year ago, the images have been collated over 10 years of photography across the country – from Kashmir to Nagaland to Gujarat and Kerala. “I haven’t seen elements of nature depicted in an artistic, photographic manner in an art show, because it is challenging,” he says, describing his depiction of air via “a prayer flag in the wind using a very slow shutter speed”. The idea is to “use photography as an artistic technique, and use colour and creativity. It’s not just clinical images of wildlife.” There will also be a section of artwork from Wildlife SOS — for instance — an elephant footprint as a painting. “Images transcend language. I want to connect people to the elemental forms we experience every day but take for granted. I hope it helps create awareness, arouses their curiousity about nature and encourages them to be compassionate towards it,” he says.
