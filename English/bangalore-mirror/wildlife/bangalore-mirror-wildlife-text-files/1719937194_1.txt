Chikkajala police have arrested four men, including two illegal wildlife traders and two buyers, for selling and buying a red sand boa.
 
 The illegal wildlife traders had brought the snake from a forest in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh and were selling it to buyers when they were arrested.
 
 The arrested have been identified as Srinivas, 38, of Prashanth Nagar, Hemanth, 38, of Kathriguppe, who are both illegal wildlife traders, and Alexander, 46, and Mahesha, 30, both from Hoskote, in Bengaluru rural, who were the buyers.

 The illegal wildlife traders were carrying the red sand boa snake in a travelling bag and had arranged to meet Mahesha and Alexander. The traders had told the two buyers that it was very auspicious and keep the “two-headed” snake inside the house.
 
 The police were tipped off about the illegal trade and rushed to the spot near Sadarahalli Gate. They nabbed the four men red-handed along with the snake. The snake was released in Bannerghatta National Park after taking permission from the court. 
 
 Red sand boa is listed under the IVth Schedule of the Wildlife Protection Act and is a protected species. Due to the appearance that the snake has two heads, superstition persists that the snakes bring “luck”.
