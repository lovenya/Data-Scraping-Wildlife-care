Sydney: Most people will be shocked at the sight of a three-year-old boy playing with a boa constrictor. But while other most mums and dads wrap their kids in cotton wool, Charlie Parker’s do the opposite and let him “play” with a string of dangerous animals, from snakes to alligators.
   And Charlie clearly takes it all in his stride, looking far from rattled as he comes face-to-face with a 10kg snake. The youngster’s legs may wobble under the weight of Pablo - a 2.5m boa constrictor - but the enormous reptile holds no fears for him.
   Charlie is already an expert snake wrangler and is laying claim to being Australia’s youngest wildlife ranger. He comes from a long line of animal lovers who own and run the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria. Proud dad and park owner Greg Parker hits back at critics saying his boy is never put in any danger. Greg said: “We’ve never purposely exposed him to the animals - he’s just got this obsession with snakes and lizards. It must be genetic.We’re still shocked by his natural ability with the animals. It’s quite remarkable to watch - he has absolutely no fear of them and he doesn’t just handle them, he also has the knowledge.“
