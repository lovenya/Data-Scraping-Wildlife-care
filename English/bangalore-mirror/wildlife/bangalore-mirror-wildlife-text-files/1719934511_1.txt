After wildlife enthusiasts raised a hue and cry, the state forest department has withdrawn the permission it gave to set up windmills in the Moorkanagudda reserve forest. An order to this effect was issued on May 3. 
 
 The wind power project would have jeopardised endangered animals including tigers, leopards, wild dogs, sambars and gaurs in the reserve forest near Sakleshpur. The Moorkanagudda reserve forest is a crucial link between Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary and Kudremukh National Park. 
   Wildlife biologist Sanjay Gubbi welcomed the forest department’s move as “a very positive step to save this excellent tiger habitat”. He added, “Though this area could have low densities of large carnivores, it acts as a critical corridor between southern and northern Western Ghats. In the interest of long-term tiger conservation in the state it is important to connect all protected areas through existing corridors. If the corridors are lost tiger conservation will become obsolete.” 
   In 2009, the state energy department had okayed a Bangalore-based hydropower company’s proposal to set up a 25 megawatt windmill project in Moorkanagudda reserve forest. The energy department gave the green signal on the condition that the forest department’s clearance was mandatory for the project. 
   The forest department granted the company partial permission to carry out testing work from mid 2010 to June 2012.
   Meanwhile, wildlife enthusiast Prashanth Yavagal and Western Ghats Environment Forum filed a petition in court against the windmill project. The case is still being heard in courts.
   “Now that the forest department has denied permission, we hope the energy department also withdraws permission,” said Sunil Gaikwad, a volunteer of Wildlife Matters Trust.
