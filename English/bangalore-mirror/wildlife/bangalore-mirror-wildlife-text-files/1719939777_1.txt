Brijesh Kumar Dixit has taken charge as the Head of the Forest Force and Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF) of Karnataka Forest Department on Thursday. He took over after Rajiv Ranjan, the former Head of Forest Force retired on September 30, 2023. On the occasion, Karnataka Forest Minister Ishwar Khandre highlighted the issue of forest encroachment in the state.

“More than one lakh acres of forest land in Karnataka has been encroached upon and all possible measures have to be taken to protect our forest and get the encroachers evicted,” said the Minister while he met Dixit on Thursday.
 
The Minister also brought up the issue of human-wildlife conflict and said that wild animals have been straying out of the forest area due to a lack of food and water availability owing to below-average rainfall this monsoon season. He instructed the official to take the required measures to ensure fodder and water availability inside the forest. “Wild animals come to Nadi in search of food and water, causing loss of life and crops. All sectors should take measures to make fodder and water available within the forest area,” added Khandre.

Addressing the human-wildlife conflict in Dakshin Kannada district, the Minister announced plans to prioritise railway barricades in the area.
