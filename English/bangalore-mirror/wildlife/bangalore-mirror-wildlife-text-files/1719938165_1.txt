You need to be present in the right place at the right time and Chinese photographer Yongqing Bao's photograph proves what getting it right looks like. Bao clicked an outstanding photograph of a marmot and a fox that has fetched him the Wildlife Photographer of the Year award. 

Capturing the bewildered marmot, the photograph is a depiction of the everyday fight for survival in the wild. Bao captured the dramatic picture of a frightened marmot as a Tibetian fox came charging. In the picture, the marmot is seen scared to death as it realises what it is faced with.

Reportedly, the picture was taken on the snow-clad slopes of China's Qilian Mountains.

Sharing the picture on its official social media handle, Natural History Museum wrote, "Yongqing Bao is our #WPY55 grand title winner, selected by our judges from over 48,000 entries. Yongqing’s powerful winning picture frames nature’s ultimate challenge - its battle for survival - in an unforgettable and unique moment between a Tibetan fox and a marmot."

         
"Combining humour and horror, the image captures an unforgettable and unique moment between a Tibetan fox and a marmot, the thread of energy between their raised paws holding them in perpetual balance," wrote the Natural History Museum.
