More often than not, injured snakes are clobbered to death. However, an animal shelter in Bangalore treated an injured rat snake (5 feet 3 inches) for a week and released it in a conducive habitat on Tuesday.   The snake was found stuck between two centering sheets and injured in its tail when it was rescued from a farm in Uttarahalli. Wildlife volunteers who rescued it brought it to People for Animals (PFA) shelter at Uttarahalli for treatment.   Dr Rohit Raj amputated its tail and put it on antibiotics. During the medical procedure, one-fourth of its tail, which was hanging cut, was excised and the wound was cauterised with electro caustic agent for the coagulation of blood and destruction of abnormal tissues. After four days of repeated dressing and care in the reptile unit of the wildlife hospital, the wound dried up. It was under observation for a few days before it was released.   PFA manager C Kishan said, “Had we released the snake in its injured state, the wound would have turned fatal. It would also have become easy prey for it predators. We wanted to ensure it was safe after its release.”    For snake rescue in Bangalore call BBMP (9880108801) or PFA (9686200656).
