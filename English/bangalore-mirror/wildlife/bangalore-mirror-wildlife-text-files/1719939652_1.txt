In a unique rescue, a fragile neonate bonnet macaque suffering from an exceptionally rare condition known as Encephalocele was rescued after it was spotted by some of the locals from KR Puram. The few-weeks-old animal was left abandoned and was in a fragile state and would have died were it left by itself.

The PfA Wildlife Rescue & Conservation Centre came to the macaque’s rescue. Encephalocele is a condition in which a portion of the brain protrudes beyond the boundaries of the skull.

Commenting on the case, Chief Veterinarian, Colonel Dr Navaz Sharif, said, “Such instances are exceedingly uncommon. In the realm of the animal kingdom, parents and the troop often relinquish newborns afflicted with deformities, as they perceive the grim odds stacked against their survival. Our encounter with this macaque, whom we have affectionately named Hanuman, occurred when he was merely a day old. He was discovered helplessly abandoned by the road in KR Puram. We named him Hanuman so he finds the strength to defy all odds and survive.” He said a team of highly skilled veterinarians and rehabilitators are ensuring comprehensive care of this macaque.

Presently sheltered within an incubator in the intensive care unit, its vital signs are vigilantly monitored, hour after hour. Nourishment is administered, addressing the unique needs that arise. Dr Shariff said, “The consequence of Encephalocele is the complete closure of its right eye, a poignant reminder of the challenges he faces. While the prospects that lie ahead for this fragile little soul remain uncertain, we are giving the utmost level of care possible. No stone shall be left unturned, as every resource and expertise is harnessed to ensure his well-being and offer him a fighting chance at a meaningful life.”

For a surgery, not only does his condition need to get stable, he is way to young, Dr Nawaz said.
