Facility being planned to attract weekend crowd from Bengaluru among other tourists 
 
 
 	

 	 		Providing seamless entertainment and recreation for visitors, the Kabini backwaters amidst picturesque Bandipur and Nagarahole Tiger Reserve will soon beckon tourists, particularly the weekend crowd from Bengaluru with river cruise facilities. Hoping to commence operations in a year’s time along the backwaters of Kabini, an MoU was inked on Thursday at the Invest Karnataka 2016 summit.
 		
 		 	 		Sources in the tourism department revealed to Bangalore Mirror that this will be the first of its kind full-fledged cruise tourism facility in Karnataka. “Though there are various private ferry services along the river Tunga­bhadra and Krishna, they do not provide any overnight recreational services and at large they would take you on a water ride for two to three hours. But this facility would provide you with an almost similar experience of a mini sea cruise,” a senior official from the tourism department said.
 		
 		 	 		The project, which will be completed in one year, will cost Rs 20 crore and the project will be implemented by Bengaluru-based hotelier K Syama Raju who is also the president of South India Hotels and Restaurants Association. Giving details about the project, Syama Raju said, “A detailed report will be made in a few days’ time in consultation with a noted sea cruise company from abroad. The services on board will be no less than a mini sea cruise. The mini ship will have about three to four decks with about 10 to 12 rooms accommodating 20 passengers at a time and five crew. The ship will be built in India as per international standards. If the department provides all the necessary sanctions, the project will see the light of day in a few months’ time. Our primary focus is to tap the weekend crowd of Bengaluru and other domestic and international travellers during weekdays.”
 		
 		 	

 	 		Year-long water assured
 		
 		 	 		As per the initial project reports by the department, the Kabini reservoir has a full capacity of 19 TMC out of which 9 TMC will be dead storage and available all through the year. “The entire backwater area has a radius of 36 km out of which about 20 km can be used for cruise purpose while the rest falls under wildlife area for which no permission will be given. The ship which will leave the shore in the morning will be anchored mid-water close to wildlife areas from where tourists can enjoy the verdant forest landscape, elephant herds and other unique flora and fauna of both Nagarahole and Bandipur. Besides well furnished living rooms, the ship will have facilities including games AND entertainment like music,” Raju said.
 		
 		 	 		Commenting on the project, Vinay Luthra, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, said, “The project will add to the existing tourism facility at Kabini and will be a major attraction in India as the place is frequently visited by both domestic and foreign nationals. The only restrictions are that they can not enter wildlife areas and cannot pollute the river.”
 		
 		 	

 	 		No cooking on board!
 		
 		 	 		Adhering to the strict guidelines of both the Centre and state governments, the investors have planned not to have any kind of cooking onboard the mini ship. “We will be buying a few acres of land adjacent to the backwaters to set up a base station and scientific kitchen. The base station with a reception centre, parking facility and sewage treatment plant (STP) will take care of all preparations for a cruise. Not a single drop of water will be let into the river. 
 		
 		 	 		“The services will be like an aircraft where everything will be carried from the base and served on board. Waste collection tanks will be kept in the ship which will be replaced during every journey. Later, the waste will be segregated and treated at the STP and treated water will be let into the river again.” Raju explained.
