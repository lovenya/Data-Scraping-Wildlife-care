Close on the heels of the city police seizing a pair of elephant tusks last Saturday, Jalahalli police seized antlers and skulls of a couple of deer on Tuesday.
 
 Based on credible information, police raided Vijayan’s accommodation and seized two pairs of spotted deer antlers and the skulls and detained him under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act for poaching/hunting and illegally possessing wildlife products.
 
 The police are now looking for the source of the two spotted deer – an adult and a sub-adult – which may have been hunted down. Police strongly suspect it to be a case of hunting as the horns were not ones that are procured after animal shedding – a natural process that takes place once a year. Also, the skulls are a big giveaway. It is being verified if Vijayan was directly involved in the hunting, and if the place from where the antlers and skulls came is a protected forest reserve.
 
 “One person has been detained and two pairs of antlers along with skulls have been seized from him. This clearly shows that it’s not a case of shedding. There are two things being probed. First, it may have been hunted and could be a case of illegal wildlife trade where the skin, antlers and flesh are sold. Secondly, it may have been procured from a deer that is killed in a wildlife sanctuary or a protected forest. In either case, its violation of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act,” a source told Bangalore Mirror.
 
 “Among the two sets of antlers, one is that of a five-to-six-year-old deer and the other of a younger one,” the source added. An official from the wildlife department said that possession of antlers of the spotted deer, which is protected under schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection act, is illegal.
