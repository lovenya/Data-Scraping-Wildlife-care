Mudumalai Forest Department in Tamil Nadu has arrested two for allegedly running an illegal cottage and being responsible for the death of an elephant on Friday.

A forest official said that a 50-year-old wild jumbo was noticed with injuries on its back in November and for the past two months they were trying to treat it. In December, they captured the injured jumbo seen with pus on the injured area and later provided treatment to that elephant and let it into the forest area.

The elephant again started moving to the residential area but did not cause any damage to anyone. In the first week of January 2021, the elephant moved to the residential area and this was noted by the residents and they started to chase the elephant.

Later, they torched a tyre and threw it on the injured jumbo. The elephant ran away with the fire injury and later died, the official added.

Based on video evidence, two accused were arrested on Friday evening under the Wildlife Protection Act section (9) (seven years imprisonment). Another person involved in this case is missing. A special team has been formed to arrest him.

A video of the incident was also released by the forest officials on January 22. The video shows an object in flames being hurled from a building on the elephant injuring its ear and the tusker running away trumpeting in pain.
