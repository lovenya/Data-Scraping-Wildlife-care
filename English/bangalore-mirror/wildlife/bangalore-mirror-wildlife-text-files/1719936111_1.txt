Scientists from Kerala discover new species of frog from Western Ghats
 
 	During the field work in southern part of Western Ghats, a team of scientists from Kerala observed a large, hitherto undescribed rhacophorid frog. 
 	  	The scientists, after observing the tadpole that can be distinguished by morphological and larval characters, as well as by its phylogenetic placement, described the third species of endemic genus Ghatixalus (Anura: Rhacophoridae).
 	  	The scientists encountered the newly described species in mid-elevation hill forests. “Based on a unique combination of molecular, morphological and larval characteristics, we ascribe this novel species to the genus Ghatixalus,” stated the research paper.
 	  	With the description of Ghatixalus magnus, there are now three nominal species in this Western Ghats endemic genus of montane frogs. This novel species potentially represents the largest known rhacophorid species in peninsular India, attaining an average male body size of 76 mm. The Rhacophorid frogs, also commonly known as shrub frogs, are found in mid-elevation hill forests between the two most prominent geological gaps of the Western Ghats, Palakkad and Shencottah Gaps.
 	  	Apart from its large size and colour, Ghatixalus magnus differs from G. asterops and G. variabilis, which are sister to each other, in tadpole morphology. “Since we found advanced tadpoles at stages 38–42 in the relatively dry month of May, prior to the southwest monsoon, it is unlikely that the large oral appendage of G. magnus tadpoles serves to provide anchorage, since flow rates are very slow in the preceding summer months when much of the tadpole’s development takes place,” stated the authors.
 	  	Elaborating on the tadpoles of Ghatixalus, the researchers have termed it as unique among the rhacophoridae for having the greatest number of labial tooth rows on both jaws.
 	  	Raorchestes flaviventris, a species of rhacophorid bush frog described from the Western Ghats by George Albert Boulenger in 1882, has never been reported from the region since its description. Scientists Robin Kurian Abraham, Anil Zachariah and Vivek Philip Cyriac have reported a record of the species after almost 132 years.
 	  	This is the same species that was described as a new species in 2014 as Raorchestes emeraldi.
 	  	Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Dr. Gururaja KV, chief scientist, Gubbi Labs, Bengaluru said, “Last year, there were nine new species of bush frogs discovered in the Western Ghats: R. emeraldi is one of those. However, with elaborate description of R. flaviventris in the present paper, R. emeraldi is now synonymized with R. flaviventris. Meaning, both are one and the same and R. flaviventris prevails as it was discovered in 1882. A researcher has to be very careful when describing new species.”
