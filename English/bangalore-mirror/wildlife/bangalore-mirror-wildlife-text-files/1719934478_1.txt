What’s on the other side of your camera?
 Children…    Oh, that’s nice. You have them clicked? No, not really. I do workshops teaching them the nuances of photography. They are so open-minded and learn quickly. But on the other end of the spectrum, I also enjoyed teaching an 82-year-old man. We had been to Bandipur and the minute we saw a tiger, he took just one picture and put down the camera. He wanted to ‘just enjoy’ looking at the tiger.  
     So now work is workshop.. Yes, about 20 days in a month are packed with workshops. Affordable cameras and Facebook have created a great interest in photography.  
 
 But your mind must be wandering..   Oh, yeah, my soul is in wildlife and I just came back from Bandhavgarh in Central India with a lot of tiger pictures.
     Oh, you spotted that (extinct) animal? Yes, dozens of them. I sighted a tiger with its kill at around six in the morning. I waited there patiently and even managed a glimpse of a tigress. After about four-and-a-half hours, the tiger came out and I had just two minutes to take some pictures. CNN has already bought the pictures! 
     Tell us which is the perfect spot to shoot a tiger? (Don’t mistake us)  Hmmm, if it is an action shot of a tiger, I would definitely go to a tiger reserve in Central India. The tigers of South India are elusive. 
 
 Your best picture so far?  In 2009, when I was backpacking in Masai Mara, Kenya, I sighted a cheetah about to hunt its prey. I took its picture at the right moment. The exposure, setting, lighting and action of that picture are simply perfect.       Ashish Parmar will conduct a workshop for children at Sublime Galleria.
