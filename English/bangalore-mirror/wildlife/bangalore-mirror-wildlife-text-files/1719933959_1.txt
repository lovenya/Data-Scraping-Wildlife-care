Will the striped squirrel go the sparrow&rsquo;s way in Bangalore?                 Now, seems like it is the turn of the striped squirrel to fade away. Poachers are getting away with the trafficking of squirrel body parts as this species is not protected under The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

City police, with help from volunteers of Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Forest Cell, caught a poacher red-handed while he was attempting to catch squirrels at a graveyard near Rammurthynagar, on the outskirts of Bangalore. Six dead squirrels were recovered from this poacher, identified as Venkataraman (38), from Mulbagal in Kolar district. 

In danger

No case could be registered against Venkataraman as the striped squirrel is not protected under The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Forest officials suggested that a case be registered against him under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. 

However, the police chose not to do so. On his part, Venkataraman walked away scot-free saying he was on a family outing and had killed the squirrels to consume their meat.

Poachers are eyeing squirrels due to the demand for squirrel body parts from the makers of wallets, mobile pouches and paint brushes.

Recently, volunteers of the BBMP Forest Cell were tipped off that a group of persons was catching squirrels at the graveyard.
 
They caught Venkataraman red-handed while he was catching squirrels by spreading nets. With Venkataraman producing passports of all his family members before the police, volunteers suspect he is part of a well established wildlife trading network. “The expertise with which he caught squirrels showed that he had previously caught several squirrels,” alleged volunteer Sharath Babu.
