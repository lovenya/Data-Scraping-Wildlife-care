In response to a growing number of complaints accompanied by photographs of film actors and politicians wearing tiger claw pendants, Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre declared on Thursday that individuals in possession of these illegal items will be given a final opportunity to surrender them to the government.

“There are regular complaints against those who wear necklaces with tiger claw lockets, and it is evident that most are unaware of the laws related to this crime. Legal recourses are being reviewed to provide a last chance to those in illegal possession of wildlife articles to return them to the government. Some people in rural areas keep deer skins, elephant ivory artefacts, deer and stag horns, etc., in their houses. 

They don’t know it is a crime. After the Varthur Santosh case was reported, there have been more complaints about such illegal possession of wildlife products. We will provide an opportunity to the public to declare such possessions and return to the government,” said Khandre.

Under the Wildlife Protection Act, killing, hunting, possessing, or wearing any article made from body parts of wild animals listed under Schedule I is a crime.

The Minister also requested television and movie personalities not to wear fake jewellery with animal body parts. He also informed that notices have already been issued to many for such acts.

“While they are wearing fake tiger lockets, many get inspired by them and end up possessing tiger claw lockets. This leads to an increase in the demand. This will lead to many animals being killed. Thus, given their social responsibility, we request dignitaries and actors not to encourage this.

The Minister also appealed to the jewellers not to indulge in manufacturing or selling jewellery with animal body parts.
