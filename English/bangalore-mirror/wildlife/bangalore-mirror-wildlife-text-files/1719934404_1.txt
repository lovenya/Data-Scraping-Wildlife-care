Police and forest officials have launched a manhunt for a self-proclaimed herpetologist, who is on the run with 25 snakes, including a python. Gururaj Sanil from Udupi was invited by a government school at Asigala near Hoskote to organise a snake exhibition for the students on Wednesday.
 
 He brought over 25 snakes for the show, including a python, russels vipers, cobras, pit vipers, Whitaker’s boas, red sand boa, trinket, Western Ghat trinkets, rat snakes and kukris.
   Though wildlife sleuths, who had been tipped off about the show, raided the school on Wednesday, Sanil managed to escape with the snakes as local villagers assaulted the officials and prevented them from rescuing the reptiles. 
   Even the police refused to file a complaint against Sanil and the school management after Dr Narayanaswamy, a local veterinarian, threatened the wildlife officials by taking the name of local MLA and labour minister Bachche Gowda. 
   However, the situation took a U-turn when the incident was brought to the notice of animal lover Maneka Gandhi, who is also a wildlife activist, who called up the minister immediately. 
   “I called him (Bachche Gowda) up and requested him to ask the villagers to give up their protest as this snake exhibitor was a wanted criminal,” Maneka Gandhi told Bangalore Mirror. 
   Gowda, who was surprised by Gandhi’s call, contacted the police and forest authorities and sought immediate action in the case. The minister also sought action against the police officials who refused to perform their duty.
   “The snake exhibitor has been booked for violating the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, for obstructing officials from performing their duty and abusing them,” said Hoskote circle inspector Subramanya who filed the case on Thursday.
