Junglee Pictures released a new poster of their upcoming film Junglee on Monday. And main lead Vidyut Jammwal is impressive, once again. 

Vidyut stars in the poster as a strong, bare-chested hero ready to protect the wild animals under his care at any cost. The poster shows Vidyut bleeding under a homemade bandage, a visual that harks back to Hollywood films such as Rambo and The Expendables. The wounded Vidyut holds a flaming torch in each of his hands in the poster as he is ready to battle with poachers who are determined to kill his friends. 

Junglee revolves around the bond between Raj (played by Vidyut) and Bhola, an elephant. The Commando actor plays the role of a veterinary doctor, who as a child, grew up with elephants on his fatherâ€™s wildlife reserve. When he returns after becoming a veterinarian, he finds that international poachers have targeted the reserve and his friend Bhola. Raj then goes on a journey to fight against the bad guys and keep them away from the animals of the jungle.
