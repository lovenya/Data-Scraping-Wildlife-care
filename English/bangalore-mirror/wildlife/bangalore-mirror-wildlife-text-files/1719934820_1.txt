What’s it all about?
 It is a programme that has been envisaged to be India’s largest two-day photography symposium dedicated to exploring the power of photography. This event brings together photographers - both professional, and amateurs, editors and publishers under the same roof. Participants get exposure to seminars, discussions, witness live photography sessions and mingle with the leaders in this business.
   Like who? Anushka Menon, Ashima Narain, Boman Irani, Dev Purbiya, Dinesh Khanna, Ganesh H. Shankar, Hari Menon, Jayanth Sharma, Kalyan Varma, Neeta Shankar, Pravin Talan, Sandesh Kadur, Sudhir Shivaram, Tarun Khiwal and Waseem Khan are the speakers at the event. This event will present a great opportunity for budding and established photographers to know what it takes to make it big in photography.
   What inspired the concept? We aim to create awareness about photography through this event and provide a common platform for individuals to mingle and learn. We believe “versatility is the key to success” and hence we have roped in some of the best talent available comprising different genres of photography.
   What’s on the agenda? Day one is dedicated to fashion, people, travel and wedding photography. On the second day, there will be wildlife, birdlife, conservation and nature photography. More than 20 topics will be discussed, besides panel discussions and live photo shoots...we promise, it will be wild. This event is also a formal launch of my company. Usually, people cut a cake. I decided to do it differently and give Bangalore a symposium, something they have never seen before.
   What’s iClick’s plan through this? iClick will be a platform which could cater to all spheres of photography and will continue to bring the best talent together to celebrate photography and our motto is to ‘Learn Connect Collaborate’.
     (The iClick Symposium will be at Sophia's High School Auditorium, Palace Road on March 16 and 17)
