Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre helps beasts saved from ‘dancing’ bear trade live full life again

Wildlife SOS, through its Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre (BBRC), has pioneered groundbreaking dental care for rescued sloth bears in India. With a state-of-the-art veterinary clinic equipped with digital dental X-ray machines and a dedicated dental suite, the centre provides specialised care for these bears, addressing severe dental issues caused by years of mistreatment in the ‘dancing’ bear trade.

 Sandhi Priya, Director of Corporate and Philanthropic Partnerships at Wildlife SOS, emphasises the severity of dental pain for these bears and the importance of specialised care to ensure their overall health. The centre, situated within Bannerghatta Biological Park, houses over 60 rescued bears, offering them a tranquil environment free from past trauma and abuse.

 The bears undergo various dental procedures, including root canal treatments and tooth extractions, administered by a team trained by UK experts.
 
 These surgeries have proven life-changing, alleviating pain and significantly improving the bears’ temperament and activity levels.
 The centre provides a nurturing environment where the bears receive a nutritious diet and engage in natural behaviours through enrichment structures.
 
 Wildlife SOS has rescued over 600 sloth bears from the brutal bear dancing practice, providing long-term care for those unfit for release into the wild due to physical and psychological trauma.

 Regular dental care is crucial, especially for geriatric bears, to prevent long-term damage and ensure they can eat without difficulty.
 
 Through its innovative dental care program and comprehensive rehabilitation efforts, Wildlife SOS and BBRC are transforming the lives of these once-abused bears, ensuring they live healthier, pain-free lives.
