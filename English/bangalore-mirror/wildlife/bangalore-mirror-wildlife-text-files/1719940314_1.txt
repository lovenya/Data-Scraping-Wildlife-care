A significant revitalisation project aimed at restoring the historic Kithaganur Lake is set to begin on July 7. The initiative, part of a two-year comprehensive plan, will involve extensive desilting, removal of invasive water hyacinths, and the creation of a robust lake bund to prevent further siltation and water contamination.

This project falls under the jurisdiction of the Kithaganur Gram Panchayat and is being spearheaded by United Way, funded through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) contributions.
 
Kithaganur Lake, a storied water body with over a century of history, has been a vital part of the local community. Once a popular spot for leisure activities and even a source of drinking water, the lake has fallen into a state of neglect and degradation in recent years. Environmental issues, combined with a lack of development efforts, have led to its current deplorable condition. Residents have reported a significant increase in mosquito breeding, making the area unpleasant and unhealthy.

Lingaraj URS, Mahadevpura Task Force Convenor, said, “The revitalisation project is designed to address these issues comprehensively. Phase one of the project will focus on desilting the lake to restore its depth and water-holding capacity. The removal of water hyacinths, an invasive species that has choked the lake, will improve water flow and quality. Additionally, a new lake bund will be constructed. The project will also include the creation of a wetland at the point where the stormwater drain enters the lake. This wetland will act as a natural filtration system, allowing contaminants to settle and ensuring that only clean water flows into the lake. This approach not only enhances the lake’s water quality but also supports local biodiversity.”

As part of the redevelopment efforts, several community-friendly features will be introduced. These include the construction of a walking path, the installation of benches, and improved lighting around the lake. Additionally, a Miyawaki forest—a dense, native plant forest that grows rapidly and supports local wildlife—will be established to enhance the lake’s surroundings and promote ecological balance.

The current state of Kithaganur Lake is a far cry from its former glory. Decades of neglect have resulted in severe siltation, water pollution, and the unchecked growth of invasive species.
 
Locals who once cherished the lake as a community hub, have stopped visiting due to its poor condition.

The foundation stone for the commencement of work was laid a few days ago, and work is scheduled to start next month.
