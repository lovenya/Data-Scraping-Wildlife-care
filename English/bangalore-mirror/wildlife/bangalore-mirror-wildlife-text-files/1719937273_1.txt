BENGALURU: Luck was on their side this time when a photographer couple from Bengaluru saw a black panther in the dense forests of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, near Mysuru in Karnataka. 

Sheshadri Vasan and Geetha Srinivasa, who have been exploring Indian jungles for the past decade, said: “We had been hearing about the animal’s movement in the forest. We missed sighting him earlier by a few seconds or had seen him perched very far on a branch. Having no expectations of sighting a big cat, all of a sudden, we spotted the black panther sitting beside the forest track recently.”

 The animals mated four times on the tree and their private moments lasted for at least 20 minutes 
 	 	 	 	 	     
The Nagarahole forests are one of the favourite habitats for these big cats which are fondly called 'bagheera'.

Bagheeras prefer the setting of dense rain forests with low sunlight and the region provides them ample food and safety.

In November last year, a group of wildlife enthusiasts spotted a Bagheera mating with a leopard on a tree in the Antarasanthe Range of the tiger reserve.
