The food at Harima is authentic and genuine; a quick place to eat lunch, while it also satisfies the local Japanese living in Bangalore. I would recommend healthy edamane and unagi if you like smoked eel and lots of matcha (Japanese green tea)!  Book - Anjum Hasan, author

I’ve just read Ruth Padel’s Tigers in Red Weather, which is a marvellous travel book around the theme of tiger conservation. I started the book thinking – “Tigers? Why is that such a big deal?” By the end of it I was humbled by Padel’s passion not just for wildlife but for life. She’s both a marvellous poet of the outdoors as well as an ardent champion of the rights of animals.  Music - Muthu Kumar, Tabla artist

I am a huge follower of Ustad Zakir Hussain’s music and that is why my all-time favourite is album is Magical moments of Rhythm by the renowned Tabla maestro. I listen to this particular music CD every single day. It is a compilation of the best moments of his tabla playing at various concerts. I like it because it is the most beautiful way to present rhythm.
