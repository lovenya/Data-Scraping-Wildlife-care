Filmmaker Sajid Nadiadwala cancelled the success party of Baaghi 2 and headed to Jodhpur after he learnt about the verdict in blackbuck poaching case. 

Salman Khan has been awarded a jail term of five years in the 20-year-old case while the other actors — Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam — have been charged under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

 Nadiadwala had organised a party in order to celebrate the blockbuster success of Tiger Shroff starrer Baaghi 2 on Friday.

 The action-entertainer entered the 100-crore club yesterday making the total collection to Rs 104.90 crores. 

 From Jeet to Judwaa to Kick and Race 3, Salman and Sajid have delivered some blockbuster films together over the years. 

 Salman will be seen next in Sajid’s production venture Race 3, which is slated to release during Eid this year.
