J C Road must be one of the busiest in the city, but on Thursday evening many people took a break from whatever they were doing as a pigeon stuck in an overhead cotton thread struggled to break free. Someone seemed to have called the BBMP wildlife cell, as a team of rescuers arrived and checked out their options on the stretch leading to Town Hall. On one side was a mall and on the other a telecom pole.  
 The bird could have been lowered by untying the thread on the mall side. However, the mall was closed. 
   Using the Bronto skylift ladder, whose base requires considerable space, was ruled out. 
   The team opted for the traditional ball-and-thread method. A strong thread was tied to a ball. The ball was thrown over the overhead thread on the mall side. The aim was to cut the overhead thread. Once it was cut, the bird fell towards the pole. Luckily, it was still alive after the fall.   Operation was over in 35 minutes   Sharath R Babu, advisor, BBMP wildlife cell, said, “This is the first case wherein the bird was stuck in cotton thread. In most cases, they are stuck in Chinese-made manja (used for flying kites), which are difficult to cut. 
   “This rescue operation was different as the bird was stuck right in the middle of a busy road. The public was extremely supportive. The bird is injured, and is recuperating.”
