Meanwhile, Rajinikanth ran into trouble after wildlife activists expressed concern over Grylls shooting his show at Bandipur Tiger Reserve during the fire season. Bengaluru based activist Joseph Hoover opined that the crew's presence in the tiger reserve could endanger the animals and even lead to forest fires. “If the government is keen on promoting wildlife tourism, they should first protect the forest...they could have done it at any other time during monsoon or after the monsoon,” he said in a video statement.

In August 2019, Grylls had hosted PM Modi in the show, which was shot at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.

In the show, former British serviceman Grylls showcases survival strategies in extreme challenging conditions in the most remote locations around the world.
