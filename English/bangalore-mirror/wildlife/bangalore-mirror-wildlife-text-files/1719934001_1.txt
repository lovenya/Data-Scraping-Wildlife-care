Home Minister P Chidambaram being blessed by an elephant                  
Wildlife officials have asked temple authorities to put an end to the practice as trainers torture the elephants, compelling them to ‘bless’ pilgrims, sometimes leaving them injured. Moreover, elephants like humans suffer from diseases like asthma and tuberculosis and it might spread to pilgrims, authorities said.

Chief wildlife warden R Sundarajaru had recently issued a circular instructing the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) department, which is maintaining temples, to stop the practice. The ban might also reduce the stress on jumbos. The wildlife department has been conducting “relief camps” for elephants for a month every year to relieve them from stress. At these camps, elephants are fed nutritious food along with medicines. These camps, run for the past seven years, have proved to be successful, the authorities said.

Meanwhile, Hindu Bakta Sabha, a religious outfit, has opposed the ban. Murugavel, one of the office bearers of the Sabha, said getting blessing from elephants was considered sacred for Hindus and any move to ban it would be against religious sentiments.
