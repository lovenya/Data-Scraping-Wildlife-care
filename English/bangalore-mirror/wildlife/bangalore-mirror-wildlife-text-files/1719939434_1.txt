Usually, college campuses are known for fun along with education. However, director Bharath G chose to show another side of a campus. His film Spooky College, scheduled for release on January 6, will showcase fear. “Spooky means fearful. I have shown fear in a different manner in this movie. 

A majority of this was shot at a century-old college in Dharwad. We shot a portion of this movie in Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary. The movie has a dance number featuring Reeshma Nanaiah. The song is a remix of the classic Mellusire Savigana from the movie Veera Kesari which featured Kannada matinee idol Dr Rajkumar and Leelavathi,’’ said Bharath.

The director said Reeshma has done a good job in the song sequence. “All the actors including Vivek Simha and Kushee Ravi have acted well. Ajaneesh Lokanath’s music is the highlight of this movie. I am grateful to Prakash for helping me to realise my dream of handling the megaphone for this movie,’’ he said.

Appreciating Bharath, producer HK Prakash said the cost of the production of this movie escalated due to the shooting schedule of this movie during the covid pandemic. “The output of this movie is good due to the hard work of actors and technicians,’’ he said.
