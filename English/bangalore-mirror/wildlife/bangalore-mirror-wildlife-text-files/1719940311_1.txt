Department requests six-month extension as many people still possess wildlife articles, mostly due to ignorance of law

The Karnataka Forest Minister, Eshwar B Khandre, in a meeting with Union Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav on Tuesday, requested another window for surrendering undeclared wildlife or animal articles in Karnataka. “It appears that there are still many people in possession of undeclared wildlife and animal artefacts, mainly due to a lack of awareness of the law.
 
We have thus requested the Union Environment Minister to amend the Declaration of Wildlife Stock Rules, 2003, for a period of six months,” said a release from the minister’s office.

According to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the recent amendments made by the central government in 2022, illegal stocking, trade, etc., of wildlife articles is a punishable offence. Previously, a similar 30-day window was opened under the Wildlife (Conservation) (Karnataka Rules) in 1973 and thereafter in 2003 for 180 days to obtain a certificate of possession of wildlife items. Additionally, a similar opportunity was yet again extended by the state government through a notification in January this year, allowing citizens to surrender undeclared wildlife or animal articles in their possession.
 
The scheme was announced on January 10, after the state government realised that some people might still have such artefacts due to a lack of awareness of the laws, and the window was closed on April 9. However, the response to this scheme was lukewarm. According to the Karnataka Forest Department, less than a hundred declarations were made in the three-month window.
