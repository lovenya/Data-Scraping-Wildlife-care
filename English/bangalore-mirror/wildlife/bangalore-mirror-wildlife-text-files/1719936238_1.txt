That the leopard was trapped inside Vibgyor High school may appear to be a huge success. But the entire operation was carried out without following safety protocols or standard operating procedure even as the forest personnel were pushed into service without protective gear.
 
 	And no surprises for that. Because the state government has been sitting on guidelines issued by the Centre almost five years ago without constituting a quick response team (QRT) to deal precisely with such situations.
 	
 	  	On April 18, 2011, the Union ministry of environment & forests (MoEF) had issued guidelines to all the states to set up QRTs in the form of primary response (PR) and emergency response (ER) teams, specifically to tackle human-leopard conflicts.
 	
 	  	The two categories of teams were supposed to deal with situations of varying degrees of urgency.
 	
 	  	But even after close to five years after the guidelines were issued, the state government has failed to set up even a single team in Karnataka.
 	
 	  	With increasing incidents of wild animals – especially leopards – straying into human settlements, experts say it is high time that the authorities woke up and put in place a proper response team. On an average, wildlife authorities in Bengaluru come across a leopard sighting or a rescue call at least once in three months. Reason? Habitat encroachment.
 	
 	  	Sample this: Vegetation cover in Bengaluru urban has shrunk from 47 per cent in 1973 to 22 per cent in 2014. Concrete structures rose from 2.3 per cent in 1973 to 31 per cent in 2014, as per TERI data released last year.
 	
 	  	These figures, experts say, are directly proportional to the declining leopard habitat, and in turn, their prey base, thus forcing them to enter the city limits. Forest fringes surrounding the city were once rocky and green, but are now sparse and intermittent.
 	
 	  	Apart from the Central guidelines, volunteers at Vanamitra, an NGO, foreseeing man-animal conflicts, had put forth an idea of a QRT to handle such encounters in urban areas including Bengaluru and Mysuru, in 2012. 
 	
 	  	However, political disinclination and bureaucratic lethargy appears to have pushed the proposal into cold storage.
 	
 	  	Sunday’s rescue operations, that took ten-plus hours at Vibgyor High, highlighted the government’s lack of preparedness to handle such an emergency, and this has brought the QRT issue to the fore again.
 	
 	  	“Chief wildlife warden Ravi Ralph and experts like Sanjay Gubbi were present at the rescue; and the operation was successful. If leopards frequent the area, the need of the hour is a team of trained experts that is well-versed with planning and execution to handle such crises. Every minute thing matters, and darting and dosage are crucial.
 	
 	
 	We need capability in planning, tracking, and cordoning-off the areas,” KMB Prasad, a retired deputy conservator of forest (DCF) involved in numerous wildlife rescues, told Bangalore Mirror.
 	
 	  	He said a hungry leopard looking for prey may lose its temperament. So an experienced team to handle distressed and unpredictable animals – a leopard in this situation – is the need of the hour.
 	
 	  	“We had proposed a QRT exclusive to leopards in 2012. The comprehensive module included human-leopard conflicts, and management and mitigation measures. It’s high time the department sets up an exclusive team to prevent any untoward incident,” Jaishankar V, a wildlife expert into leopard conservation, from Vanamitra, told Bangalore Mirror.
 	
 	  	Even after the Sunday’s incident, the state government continues to sit on its hands over taking a prompt action on QRT. Forest minister B Ramnath Rai merely said: “We will look into the QRT issue.”
 	
 	
 	FOR A RESCUE OP
 	
 	
 	Animal attack protective jackets, hard armour plates, puncture/slash/bite-resistant chain mail, chemical capture equipment, drugs, trap cages, ladders, nets, barricades, gas pistols are basic equipment besides first-aid kits. 
 	
 	
 	
 	ANIMAL RESCUES
 	
 	
 	DOs
 	
 	 		* MoEF Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) should be followed
 		
 		 	 		* The district authorities should ensure law & order by imposing section 144 to avoid agitation/excited local people.
 		
 		 	 		* PR to be pressed before ER takes over rescue
 		
 		 	 		* Equipment like trap cages, protective gear like baffle boards, ladder, tarpaulin sheets, nets, to be kept ready 
 		
 		 	 		* Barriers have to be created cordoning off the animal
 		
 		 	 		* Appropriate remote drug delivery equipment (blowpipe, gas pistol, rifle) and drugs should be available
 		
 		 	 		DON’Ts
 		 	 		* Heroics (e.g. trying to tackle the animal without any training or equipment) on the part of officials, volunteers, 	 		onlookers to be prohibited
 		
 		
 		 			RESCUE EXPOSED UNPREPAREDNESS 
 			 		 			The 10-hr leopard rescue on Sunday at Vibgyor High exposed the unpreparedness of our forces. The shortcomings include:
 			 		 			* The team that handled neither had nor was provided with protective gears – a baffle board as per the MoEF directive on rescue of operation.
 			
 			 		 			* No ER (Emergency Response) or PR (Primary Response) was pressed as the state doesn’t have one
 			
 			 		 			* No uniform as specified to an ER team was provided. Minimum safety precautions life providing leather gloves were not there.
 			
 			 		 			* Except a tranquiliser and nets the team had no other equipment to counter the leopard in distress.
 			
 			 		 			* Lack of trained staff is another lapse
 			
 			 		 			* Although protocol of ER should be periodically rehearsed, the nonexistence of an ER team ended in a random rescue op, fortunately without much damage but with some injuries.
