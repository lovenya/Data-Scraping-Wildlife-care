A community-based conservation project by Wildlife SOS has converted local poachers in Ramdurga Valley into forest protectors. The once-green Koppal district has always had a rich biodiversity, but illegal mining, human encroachment, rapid deforestation and ritual hunting by locals had destroyed this region and increased man-animal conflicts.

The programme aimed at conserving nearly 40 acres of land and protecting several endangered species native to this region like sloth bears, pangolins and leopards. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Samad Kottur, Conservation Advisor at Wildlife SOS, said though there was resistance at first from the locals, gradually they saw value in putting an end to their practices. This helped restore their agricultural lands and replenish groundwater levels. Locals who were dependent on hunting and poaching, were made protectors by employing them to manage patrolling activities. . They also earned an alternate source of income. The on-site team was involved in the greening efforts – planting special trees, weeding, watering, patrolling fences etc.
Borewells and drip irrigation systems were integrated and solar powered electrical fences were installed.

The transformation over the years is visible. The flora and fauna native to the region are flourishing. Says Kottur, ``We still have certain challenges. We hope that the district administration stops allotting land in the wildlife habitat.”
