Karnataka, which is known for the most number of tigers in the country, is seeing a number of tiger deaths recently. In just40 days of 2017, seven tigers from various forest ranges have died. The latest is a tigress from Bandipur. The eight-year-old cat was found dead in Kudahalla near Balluru Hundi Forest Beat in Yadiyala Range of Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The dead body was spotted after three days. Giving the post mortem report, forest officials said the tigress was well grown and healthy.
 
 The death is probably due to in-fighting with a male tiger, which has left its neck bone punctured with wounds in both hands, damages in the shoulder region and ribs bone broken, leading to internal bleeding. The officials also said the tigress had major injuries on its face with the right eye appearing ruptured.
 
 Speaking about the recent deaths, sources from the National Tiger Conservative Authority said, â€œThe mortality of tigers in December and January is usually more. In 5-6 years, there will be more deaths due to various reasons, and this year it will peak. Three of the dead tigers from our state died of natural causes, but we do agree there are a few human errors which might have caused some deaths. Since Karnataka has more tigers, the death rate is also high in our five tiger reserves. But there is no need to worry, they told BM.
