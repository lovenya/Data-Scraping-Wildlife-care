A day after the video of a lion cub being chased by car went viral, the forest department has arrested four persons for endangering wildlife. A 50-second video that shows the cub running for its life while being chased by the accused had triggered an investigation by the forest department along with the help of the Crime Branch. The accused will be produced in the court on Thursday. Confirming the incident, Chief Conservator of Forest A P Singh said, “We made rangewise teams who, along with police, went on different routes to check where the video may have been shot.
 
 They also checked who uploaded the video on social media and tracked down the original source. This helped us catch the culprits within 24 hours. They are being interrogated right now. They will be produced in court on Thursday.” The accused, identified as Utpal Pandya, Parthiv, Brijesh and Devang, have been booked under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. According to sources, the accused were driving a car registered in Bhavnagar. “The four were chasing lion cub in Visavadar range area. They had been invited by a Visavadar resident to see the Lions in the region. But when the four couldn’t spot the Lions during the day, they took out the vehicle at night and spotted the cub and ended up chasing it,” sources said.
