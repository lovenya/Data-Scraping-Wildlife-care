Former Indian cricketers Roger Binny, Javagal Srinath and Syed Kirmani participated in ‘Wild Life Week’- a wildlife awareness program organised by Forest Department on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi at Cubbon Park in Bengaluru.

Calling himself a wildlife freak, Kirmani extended his support to banning plastic. “The walkathon is a great initiative to raise awareness about wildlife. We are very happy to be associated with it, we are all wildlife freaks,” Kirmani told ANI.

Hailing the government’s decision to ban plastic Binny said: “I think its a wonderful idea. Plastic is a havoc.”
