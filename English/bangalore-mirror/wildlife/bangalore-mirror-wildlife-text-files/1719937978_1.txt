High Court issues a set of directions for protection of forests in Karnataka

The High Court has issued some directions to the authorities on controlling forest fires. The court has said that forest officials should shoulder the entire responsibility for forest fires that result in damage to flora and fauna. 

A villager from Kodagu, KV Ravi Chengappa, had filed the petition in the High Court seeking directions to the authorities about containing forest fires. Just B Veerappa while disposing the petition issued strict directions that need to be followed. 

Among the directions, the HC said that the State Government should immediately take necessary steps to prevent fores fires in all forest areas in Karnataka. The court said that there should be coordination among the various departments of the government in this regard. 

Local officials to be responsible 

The High Court said that in case of forest fires, the local forest officials should be held responsible. The court felt that the time is ripe for everyone in the society, including the educated and the uneducated, come together to save forests. Justice Veerappa said that man has crossed all limits when it came to destroying the environment and that is resulting in conflict between man and wildlife. Without urgent measures, mankind will reach the brink of extinction, he said. 

In specific directions regarding the plea of the petitioner Chengappa, the court directed that a team consisting of forest officials from Kodagu and local residents, including the petitioner should be formed. The government advocate argued that Chengappa should not be included in the said panel which was rejected by the court. Chengappa's advocate Pavan Chandra Shetty sought the use of drone cameras for assessing forest fire damages. The government advocate did not see the necessity of drones and said that existing measures were sufficient.
