Members of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wildlife team rescued a 12-foot-long python at Hemmigapura ward in Rajarajeswari Nagar on Sunday midnight.

“The python was found near the compound wall of a vacant site at Hemmigepura. A few people wanted to attack it as they feared for the safety of their pet dogs and calves. I came to know that it had swallowed a dog,” said A Prasanna Kumar, a member of the rescue team.

This is the second incident of a large python rescue in the city. In 2016, a 10-foot-long Indian Rock python was rescued from a compound wall in Kadugodi.

BBMP Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) and Deputy Wildlife Warden Ranganath Swamy said that he made all the arrangements to release the python into the Turahalli reserve forest.

“The rescue team brought the python to the BBMP head office since the wardens needed a letter seeking the forest department’s permission to release the python into Turahalli reserve forest,” said Ranganath Swamy.

The python was released into Turahalli reserve forest at 3.30 pm on Monday.

“We reached the spot as soon as we received a phone call from a resident,” said Prasanna Kumar.

 He added, “The python was rescued and brought to the BBMP head office. I appeal to the public to not approach unprofessional people who are not authorised to handle snakes when they find a python in their area. Every year, we rescue five to six pythons, but all of them are small in size.” 

This is the longest python rescued yet, added Prasanna Kumar.
