In a letter from the Department of Environment and Forests, under the Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) to the state government, the former has directed the State Government to ensure that facilities like electricity, power, water, training tracks, bund school, equine swimming pool and a 24-hour fully equipped equine hospital be provided to the horses at the present location (Race Course Road) till such time that alternative arrangements are made. 

It is a big step backwards for the Yeddyurappa Government which will now have to take care of the horses, failing which they can be charged under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 and the broader Wildlife Prevention Act 1972. It may be recalled that the Yeddyurappa government issued an ultimatum to the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) officials to shift location or face being thrown out of the present prime location by December 31, 2009.

With BESCOM having issued a notice to BTC that power supply would be terminated on January 1, 2010, the MEF has directed the state government to ensure that this doesn't happen.
