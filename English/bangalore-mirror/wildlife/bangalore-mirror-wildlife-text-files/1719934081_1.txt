The government has now backed a farmer outfit’s plan to shoot monkeys at sight as the simians have been damaging crops. 

“Operation Monkey"" has already received the consent of the government,"" said Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal. Last week, the Kheti Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (KBSS) virtually issued shoot-at-sight orders to prevent marauding monkeys from taking over their fields. 

Fed up with the failure of successive governments in the state, thousands of farmers under the KBSS plan to go for mass shooting on random sighting of wild animals, including monkeys, wild boars and blue bulls, from December 10 to 23. 

KBSS state convenor Kuldeep Singh Tanwar said the government has failed to check the monkey menace. “The wild animals cause losses to the tune of Rs 300 crore annually. Of this, more than 50 per cent of damage is caused by monkeys,” he said. 

Chief Wildlife Warden A K Gulati said as per the government notification, the area divisional forest officer and range officers have been authorised to issue permits for killing the animals.
