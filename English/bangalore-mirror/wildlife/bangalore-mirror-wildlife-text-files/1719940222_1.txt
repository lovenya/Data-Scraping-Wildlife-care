Rain, climate change driving snakes out of their habitat and into residential areas

As Bengaluru experiences rainfall, many citizens are getting uninvited guests at home. Snakes, venturing out of their habitats, are entering homes, prompting complaints from residents.
 
Snake rescuers are responding to these calls, safely relocating the snakes to nearby forests.

Over the past few weeks, several homes in Bengaluru have reported encountering snakes seeking refuge from the rains. These snakes have been found in various places such as bathrooms, cars, garages, kitchens, atop two-wheelers, and even inside shoes. This influx of snakes into residential areas reflects the city’s transition from a garden city to an urban jungle, exacerbated by heavy rainfall in recent weeks.

A wildlife rescuer confirmed receiving multiple calls from rain-affected areas and shared experiences of rescuing numerous snakes, including Russel’s vipers and cobras, primarily from residential premises. 

The unusual timing of snakes entering homes during the season, when reptiles typically hibernate, can be attributed to environmental and climate changes. The cooling temperatures are insufficient for hibernation yet not warm enough for snakes to digest food properly, leading them to seek warm spaces indoors. Additionally, heavy rains have caused water-logging in snake burrows and lakes, forcing even aquatic snakes to enter homes through drains.

Snake rescuers stress on the importance of contacting government departments for snake rescues rather than private pest control companies, highlighting legal protections for snakes.

 Unqualified individuals using illegal methods for snake extraction can harm these animals. The need for coexistence with snakes was underscored, as they play a vital role in controlling rodent populations and preventing the spread of diseases.

Meanwhile, videos on snake handling have gone viral, leading to inexperienced individuals attempting dangerous maneuvers. With increased rainfall, snake rescuers are receiving more calls, particularly for rat snakes and cobras. Changes in city infrastructure, like concretised drains, have displaced snakes onto streets, presenting new challenges.

“Out of the 26 species of snakes found in Bengaluru, the three most commonly encountered ones are cobras, rat snakes, and checkered keelbacks. These snakes are categorised based on their habitat as terrestrial, arboreal, and aquatic. It’s important to recognise that as long as humans inhabit an area, there will be human waste, which attracts rodents and subsequently snakes. 

While these three species have adapted well to Bengaluru’s changing environment, the Russell’s viper is not frequently found in the core city due to habitat loss, as they prefer open land and rocky terrain. Snake rescuers have been actively rescuing snakes from various locations such as TV stands, shoes, kitchens, and air conditioners,” said a snake rescuer.

Snake catchers offer valuable tips, stressing on the need to maintain cleanliness in the surroundings. If a snake is spotted inside the compound wall, it’s crucial to immediately seek professional assistance. Common snake species in Bengaluru include cobras, rat snakes, checkered keelbacks (Fowlea piscator), and Russell’s vipers (Daboia russelii).
