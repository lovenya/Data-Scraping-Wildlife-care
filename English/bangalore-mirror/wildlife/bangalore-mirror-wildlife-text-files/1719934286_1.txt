After years of abuse, 38-year-old Bhola is happy again – thanks to the help offered by British vets. The five-tonne bull was regularly whipped and beaten with an iron rod by his owners. The torture left him blind with an injury in one eye and a cataract in the other. 
 
 Bhola was made to walk for hours on the streets of Delhi. Last November, he was struck by a truck and left for dead. 
 However, animal lover Kartick Satyanarayan, who runs Wildlife SOS came and rescued the injured tusker.
 
 Bhola was shifted to an animal hospital in Agra where British vets Florence Elphick and Kate Jones operated on him. 
 
 “We could possibly remove the cataract from his left eye and give him vision again,” said British veterinaryophthalmologist Claudia Hartley. 
 
 As Bhola splashes his trunk playfully in the water, the shy elephant is at last surrounded by love – including a girlfriend Maya.
