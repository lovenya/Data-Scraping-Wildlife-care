Lord Shiva is usually shown seated on a tiger skin, which is said to represent his conquering of lust and ‘manas’ (mind). Many swamijis had tiger skins as their seats. But with animal activists crying foul, they have refrained from using them. Swami Nithyananda, however, falls into a different category. He not only sits regally on a tiger skin, but also does not invite animal activists' wrath. Reason: He uses an imitation skin.   Nithyananda, whose popularity rose after he was chosen as one of the Mahamandaleshwars (spiritual head) of Mahanirvani Akhara in north India, sits on the skin while delivering spiritual discourses.   A spokesperson from Nithyananda's ashram in Bidadi said: ""It (tiger skin) is made of synthetic material. It was donated by a devotee. Use of (real) tiger skin is banned. Swamiji has overcome gross human emotions, which is why women feel safe in the ashram. They have left high-paying jobs to come and serve the mission full time.""   Trading in tiger skin and body parts is banned, but illegal trade and killing of the national animal is flourishing. The 2008 audit found there were only 1,400 wild tigers in the country.   Senior designate advocate M T Nanaiah says it is not an offence to possess or use imitation wildlife skin. He said: “It is not just tiger skins, but skins of spotted deer too were used by some swamijis. If they are legally obtained, they had to be declared and a certificate had to be obtained from the forest department. ”
