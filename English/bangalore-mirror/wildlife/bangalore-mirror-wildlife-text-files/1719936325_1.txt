They say it’s wrong to pigeon-hole someone, but in the case of French national Natapee, it’s safe to say she’s an animal-lover.
 
 	While strolling through Lalbagh on Tuesday, Natapee found an injured pigeon on the ground. She immediately gave it the once-over and discovered that its tail had been clipped and it was exhausted. Seeing that passersby were going to be of little help, she immediately took the pigeon to the botanical garden’s horticultural department, where she entered the director’s office with the bird. 
 	
 	  	Fearing for the bird’s life, Natapee requested the bird get immediate treatment. She was told that she could leave the bird there and officials from the Wildlife Wing would come and collect it; but this French lady wasn’t for moving. She stayed with the pigeon for the couple of hours it took the officials to arrive and made sure she gave them her contact details so she could take care of any medical costs.
 	
 	
 	
 	  	Speaking to BM, Prasanna Kumar, member of the BBMP Wildlife team told BM the bird was a racing pigeon and probably fell from the sky due to exhaustion.
