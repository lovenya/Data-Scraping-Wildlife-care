An eight-year-old sloth bear that had accidentally got entangled in a wire fence and injured itself in Kannur was rescued after a full-fledged mission.
 
On Thursday early morning, the male sloth bear moved out of the Nagarhole tiger reserve towards the Kannur village, where it got entangled in the fence between two estates. The sharp fence injured the bear as it tried to release itself.
 
Mahesh Kumar, IFS, Director, Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, said, “The bear couldn’t free itself. The locals then informed our rescue operation team, after which a team of officials reached the spot started the rescue operation.” Kumar said the sloth bear had walked 1.5- 2 km from the boundary of the forest and reached the village.

 “Though temporary trenches are made in the forest, the bear would have found a bottleneck to cross the fence. As it is not a fool-proof fencing, the bear could have easily moved out,” Kumar added.

The bear had bruises all over the body and the wildlife doctors treated it. “The bear was spotted in the afternoon and we immobilised it, after which it was taken for treatment. The wounds were treated and on Friday it was released back to the forest,” he said.
 
An officer said the bear was dehydrated too. “We cut of the wires that held the bear captive. It responded well to the medical treatment and once it seemed okay, it was released,” the officer said.
