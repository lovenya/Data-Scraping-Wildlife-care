The Gachibowli police arrested them when they were consuming the meat. They recovered some meat and carcasses of the animal, after some was sold and a little was consumed. According to police, HCU shooting range incharge Govinda Rao and his two assistants had hunted the animal today, taking advantage of the holiday environment on the campus.

 	Deer hunting is a non-bailable offence under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the minimum jail term is three years and a cash fine upto Rs 25,000, if proved guilty. Deer hunting has become a menace on the HCU campus with six cases officially registered in 2015.
 	  	In 2012, the police arrested two youths, both sons of HCU employees for snaring a male spotted deer. Notably, that incident too took place on a Sunday. Situated on a sprawling 2,300 acres of land, HCU is home to a variety of wildlife.
 	  	The campus is rich in flora and fauna, home to over 734 flower plants, ten species of mammals, several species of reptiles and birds. Spotted deer, hares, peacocks, porcupines and wild boar are a common sight on the campus, which has two perennial and three seasonal water bodies.
