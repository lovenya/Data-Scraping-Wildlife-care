Talk about an innovative way to make money and here’s one should make it to the beginner’s crook book. Twenty-year-old Syed Rafeeq would release a snake in a densely populated area and collect a handsome reward for catching the reptile and bringing relief to the unsuspecting neighbourhood. Syed was finally apprehended by Mico Layout police on Friday and booked under Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. According to sources in BBMPs Forest Cell, Syed, also known as Haneef, would mislead people by using the name of renowned herpetologist Anees Ahmed.

Officials from the BBMP’s Forest Cell informed Bangalore Mirror that acting on a complaint by volunteers of the forest cell, Mico Layout police arrested Syed who claimed to be Anees and seized five snakes — a cobra, rat-snake, sand boa and banded viper — from him. We received information that he went around in the name of Anees to catch snakes and charged anywhere between Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per snake. Even though we knew he was impersonating Anees, we ran checks with Anees himself and confirmed that this man was not only misleading people but was also in illegal possession of snakes, said a senior official, Forest Cell.

Snake expert Anees said, “The man had approached me a few years ago and had introduced himself as Haneef. He offered to work for me in catching snakes, but I rejected. But he continued to use my name and mislead people. 

In his recent venture, Syed charged from political leader Vatal Nagaraj Rs 5,000 on the scare that a snake in the house was a bad omen for the politician who is contesting elections. 

Bhoruka Park in Whitefield with its 4-5 acre campus is home to many snakes. Syed and his accomplices pretended to be snake catchers and told the officials that they had a medicine which would attract the snakes and make entrapment easy. They caught more than 50 snakes and charged close to Rs 300 to Rs 400 per snake, said a source.
