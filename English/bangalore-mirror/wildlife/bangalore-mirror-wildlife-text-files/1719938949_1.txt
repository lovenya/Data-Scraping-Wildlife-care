Spots that earlier saw over 10,000 visitors just host around 2,000 now

Weekend curfew and the spreading of covid-19 infections not only affected the tourism industry in the state, but the economy of Mysuru is also severely affected.
 
Mysuru is deserted without tourists. When the businesses were trying to recover from the second wave of covid-19, the fear of the third-wave created panic among the people. Even though the death rate in the third wave is low, the weekend curfew affected the arrival of tourists to the city. Per day before the pandemic, over 10,000 people would visit Mysore Palace, Karanji Lake, Zoo and Chamundi hills. Now, it has come down to 2,000 people.

On January 1, 10, 215 people visited Mysore Palace. The trend followed the next day. But on January 3, only 3,930 tourists visited the palace. These numbers declined from January 6 to 2,532 and January 7 to 2,787 tourists. After the weekend curfew on January 11, the number of tourists reduced to only 2,131. When the number of tourists comes down, it is affecting many sectors which depend on tourism. Most of the hotels are deserted and lodges are empty. Likewise, taxis are also at a loss. As the schools are closed, stationery shops are also in distress.

Meanwhile, the Mysuru Union of Organisations urged the Government to withdraw weekend curfew, 50% rule, and other restrictions. For the last two years, most of the hotels and other businesses are facing severe losses. Government must withdraw all the restrictions and allow free movement to the people. The daily labour is dependent on daily wages. With all these restrictions, they are suffering a lot. So, the Government must implement strict sanitization rules and allow businesses to operate as normal. The Hotel Owner’s Association President Narayana Gowda says, “When we are trying to overcome the effects of the pandemic, implementing weekend curfew is not a good decision. The tension among the people is not only affecting the hospitality sector but also the economy.

Mysuru Union of Organisations President BS Prashanth says, “Government is making one rule for the common man and the other for politicians. Weekend curfew is not a solution.” He opposes the unscientific restrictions. The lockdown will bring a bad name to the government.”

Railway Station and Airport are empty
Mysuru Railway station was always crowded with commuters. Each day there are 15,000 people who visit the Railway station. Now it is reduced to a mere 5,000. After the second wave, the trains resumed and life was normal. Weekend curfew and night curfew made the people confined to their homes. Flying to Mysuru is an all-time favourite for tourists. Most of the air travellers are tourists. Most of the seats in the flights filled 95 pc of seats. Mysuru-Hyderabad, Mysuru-Chennai, Mysuru-Goa routes were in high demand. But after this third wave, there are 30 pc of seats are empty.

More tigers in state forests

Wildlife experts believe that the tiger population may have increased in the state forests. While this is good news for many, some fear that this may lead to a human-tiger conflict, as the forest cover is reducing. The tiger population is said to have increased in Bandipur Reserve Forest, BRT hills, Male Mahadeshwara Betta, and other places.
 
The tiger population in 2018 was estimated at around 173 in Bandipur. Now, there is a chance of an increase in numbers. In Bandipur Forest, the tally is 60 tigers and 12 to 15 in Male Mahadeshwara Betta forests. Currently, the tigers in the Chamarajanagar district are more than 250.
 
Wildlife photographer R K Madhu said, “We have to think about the protection of habitat along with the protection of tigers. When their population increases, their habitat also increases.”
 
Wildlife expert Sanjay Gubbi added, “Government must rehabilitate the people. It must also support them for two years to the families after rehabilitation.”
