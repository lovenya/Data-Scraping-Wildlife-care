This has reference to the news item ‘Delhi lady calls city activists to save Lalbagh kite’ (BM, Nov, 9).  The efforts of Carolina Fernandes to free the bird need to be appreciated. It is deplorable that her plea to rescue the bird was ignored by Lalbagh staff. They should be taken to task for their apathy.  — N R Ramachandran   
 Carolina Fernandes’s visit to B’lore has saved the life of a paria kite. The efforts she took to inform wild life enthusiasts in Bangalore about the trapped bird after she reached Delhi shows her deep love for wildlife and concern towards a near extinct species. She and the wild life enthusiasts deserve higher accolades for their swift action. She is far better than the so-called animal lovers who run email campaigns from the comfort of their homes only to gain media glare. — S B Yarazarvi
