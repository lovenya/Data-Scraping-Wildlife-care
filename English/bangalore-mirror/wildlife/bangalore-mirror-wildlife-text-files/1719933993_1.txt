Ananth Hegade Ashisara, head of Western Ghats Task Force, told Bangalore Mirror, “The Ambara Gudda region, covering over 250 hectares, in the Kodachadri area was declared a Natural Heritage site after the high court decided in the government's favour in June. The court banned mining and construction activities, clearing the forest for agriculture, and encroachment in the area. The government can now resume promoting tourism in the area, which it could not earlier due to the litigation. Kodachadri had always been a popular destination for trekking, bird-watching and wildlife photography. Besides, many pilgrims who flock to the adjoining Kollur temple visit the peak.” VIEW FROM THE PEAK
Kodachadri is located in Hosanagar taluk of Shimoga district. It is 1,343 metres above sea level. It has the original temple of Mookambika built by Adi Shankaracharya [the more popular pilgrim spot is the temple at Kollur nearby]. The peak offers a glimpse of the Linganamakki backwaters and Arabian Sea. It is a favoured destination among adventure enthusiasts and people who love the outdoors. 

Several trekkers flock the peak and waterfalls nearby during the monsoon and in winter. Trekking in the monsoon is considered a challenge owing to thick clouds of mist, and leeches. Another popular activity is night treks, including on full moon nights.
