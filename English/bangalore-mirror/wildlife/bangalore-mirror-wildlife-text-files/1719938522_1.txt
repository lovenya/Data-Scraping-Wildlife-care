A peafowl was rescued from Mahalakshmi Layout in Bengaluru on Thursday. It was first sighted inside a resident’s compound on Wednesday and the bird had not been able to fly or move since.

Rajesh Kumar, an honorary wildlife rescuer from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Forest Cell, rescued the bird handed it over to a wildlife hospital in the city. The bird might have suffered a head injury during flight, said a veterinarian at the hospital.

Peafowl sightings have become common around Bengaluru, especially in areas such as Malleshwaram, Vijayanagar, Rajajinagar and Raja Rajeshwari Nagar. Rajesh said that these birds have become a part of the ‘urban wildlife’ in Bengaluru. “Avians such as peafowls may either fly to and from the city or thrive in green patches such as parks and tall trees within. They are adapting to the city very well and their population is also on the rise, making them easy to spot around.” The growth of the peafowl population is also aided by the absence of their natural predators in the city. 

You can call the forest helpline number 1926 if you spot or see any animal in distress.
