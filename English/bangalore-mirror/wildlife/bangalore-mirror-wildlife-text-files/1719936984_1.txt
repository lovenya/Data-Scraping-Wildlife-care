Group monitoring the amphibians in the Western Ghats records increase in their numbers
 
 In an attempt to understand the importance of frogs, the Bisle Kappe Team – a group of likeminded individuals have been organising the Bisle Frog Watch in the pristine Western Ghats for the past six years. The result-they have been observing an increase in the species recorded and with the permission of the forest department hope to explore more places in the future.
 
 Vineeth Kumar from the team as well research scholar at Mangalore University told BM the Bisle Frog Watch was launched in 2012 by two techies, Vivek and Deepika, who moved to the US in 2015. From then on, a group of enthusiasts have taken it forward.
 
 This year, the team organised this event as part of the Citizen Science Initiative in association with the Kudremukh Wildlife Foundation and the Bengaluru-based Gubbi Labs from June 9-11. The aim is to introduce people to the world of lesser known creatures- amphibians. A group of 23 enthusiasts from various fields, including students researchers, doctors and engineers, participated in informal classroom sessions were participants were introduced to the world of amphibians- their taxonomy, ecology and behaviour, along with the talk on conservation and citizen science. In the field sessions, participants learned how to identify different frogs and toads by using key characters and also observed various behavioural aspects.
 
 The core Bisle Kappe team includes Rohit S Rao, CEO Crystal Electronics, Shashwat Jaiswal- a mechanical engineer working in a private company in Bengaluru and Vineeth Kumar.
 
 Resource persons for the workshop included Dr K V Gururaja, faculty at the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology and batrachologist Dr Sudhira HS from Gubbi Labs, Niren Jain co-ordinator Kudremukh Wildlife Foundation, Madhushri Mudke blogger and conservationist from Manipal and Vineeth Kumar. The workshop was supported by Ashok Vardhan Green enthusiast and the team visited ‘Asoka Vana’and Bisle Beauty Spot.
 
 Vineeth Kumar said, “I have been part of this team, first as a student and now as an organiser. A total of 33 people participated in the frog watch. We observed the behaviour, mating as well as calling patterns and explored of spots around the community hall. We even saw dancing frogs. We also observed endangered species such as small tree frogs in good numbers. Handling of frogs was restricted to prevent the possible spread of fungal infections,” said Vineeth.
 
 Dr Gururaj said the number of frog enthusiasts is increasing. “Despite notification about the event being an internal circulation, about 50 people responded, but we had to restrict the number to 33,” he said.
