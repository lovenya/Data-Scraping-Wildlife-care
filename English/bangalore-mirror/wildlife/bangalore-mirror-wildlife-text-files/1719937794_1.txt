6-year-old tiger at DB Kuppe killed three villagers in the last one month

A male tiger, which has been on a killing spree at DB Kuppe Range under the Nagarahole National Park, was captured amid high drama on Friday. According to forest officials, the six-year-old tiger killed three people in the last few days. The tiger has been sent to Kurgahalli Rehabilitation Centre at Mysore Zoo.

Subhash Malkhede, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) told Bangalore Mirror, “The male tiger is about 5.5 to 6 years old and has an injury. The tiger was captured at DB Kuppe Wildlife range of Nagarahole National park of HD Kote Taluk in Mysuru district.

Teams have been trying to track the elusive predator since Monday after it killed Chinappa, 36. On Thursday, Kencha, 56, from Manchure, was also killed by the same tiger. The operation began at 6am on Friday under the leadership of Chief Wildlife Warden C Jayram. Three teams moved in different directions to track down the tiger. 

Four elephants were also used for the operation. Once the tiger was tracked near the village, it was darted and successfully tranquilized. 

Subhash Malkhede said, “Four elephants (Arjuna, Abhimanyu, Ganesh and Kumaraswamy) were used for the operation and it was Arjuna that took the lead. Once the tiger was tracked Arjuna was sent along with the team and veterinarians. Though a small operation, it has been a very important one.’ 

Villagers have been protesting against forest officials to cage the ‘killer’ tiger.
