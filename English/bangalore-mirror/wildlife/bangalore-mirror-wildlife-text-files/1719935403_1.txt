 	Speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of the regional consultation meeting on polio eradication in Bangalore, Siddaramaiah said, “There is nothing political in appointing Rana George to the Wildlife Board. In fact, Rana has been an environment lover for several years. He has been an environmentalist and has contributed immensely to the field in the last three years.” 

 	Sources in the state government said that Rana had been a wildlife warden for four years and has been involved in various conservational activities. Even though government was supposed to appoint three MLAs to the board as members, the CM has not appointed any political person and hence there was no political intervention in appointment.
