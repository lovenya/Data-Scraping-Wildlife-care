Former cricketer Rahul Dravid had a visitor calling on him, absolutely unannounced, at his residence in Mahadevapura on Tuesday afternoon. It was a four-foot long rat snake!   The reptile was found taking a leisurely swim in the fountain at the entrance of his house in Epsilon. The cricketer then called wildlife volunteers to rescue the snake.   “We got a call from Rahul between 4 and 4.30pm. He calmly told us that there was a snake in his house and that it had to be rescued,” said Sharath Babu, BBMP wildlife warden.    How did the snake get there in the first place? Babu revealed that he often gets  calls about stray reptiles in and around houses at Epsilon.   “The day before we rescued a snake from actress Bhumika Chawla’s house which is behind Dravid’s. Wherever there is any sort of garbage there will be rodents, and these in turn attract snakes. Also, this area has a huge garden and green area which would invite frogs. These amphibians in turn lure snakes,” he said.   On seeing the snake, the family of four did not fret or scurry. They were instead calm, composed and curious. According to sources, Dravid and his son were inquisitive about the reptile and wanted to learn more about it.    “They wanted to know the species of the snake and what we would do with it once it was rescued,” added Babu.   The snake will be released in the wild.
