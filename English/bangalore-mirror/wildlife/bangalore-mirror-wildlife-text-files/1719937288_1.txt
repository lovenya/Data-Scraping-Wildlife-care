Ahead of the Budget, we look at what is at stake for Karnataka and also at the status of rail projects that were proposed
 
 For major projects of the Railways to be completed in the state, it takes nothing less than a decade. For instance, the Nelamangala-Shravanabelagola railway line, part of the new 166 km Bengaluru- Hassan line was announced by Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda in 1996. It became a reality only recently.
 The project progressed at a snail’s pace because of non-availability of land and meagre fund allocation by the Railways. However, in the recent days, projects have picked up pace, but more needs to be done.
 
 Sanjeev V Dyamannavar from Praja RAAG, an advocacy group told BM, “In the last few years, projects have picked up pace especially on the doubling and electrification, but other things likes station development and other facilities are not up to the mark in places other than Bengaluru, Mysuru and Hubbali.”
 
 He said, there aren't many Shatabdi and AC Express trains in Karnataka. The government can consider introducing Vistadome trains- on the Ghat section of Hassan- Sakleshpur (especially the day train service so that passengers can view the Western Ghats) and the Mangaluru- Karwar section. “There are no fast trains from Hubbali or Ballari to Bengaluru. This is a neglected segment. We do not have double-decker trains running within Karnataka," he said.
 
 Prakash Mandoth, former member, Zonal Railways User Consultative Committee, South Western Railways and Southern Railways and President of Bengaluru Metro and Sub Urban Rail Passenger Association said the Railways was moving in the right direction. “The automatic signalling of belt area of Bengaluru has to be taken up. In addition, the Chennai Express train 12609/12610 should be extended to Mysuru. Mysuru region must be compensated since one train (Mangaluru Train) has been withdrawn,” he said.
 
 He demanded the scrapping of the Hassan Mangalore Railway Development Company. “The Railways should take over the Hassan-Mangaluru area of track. There is no development at all on this stretch. Pressing for a separate Mangaluru division, he said, “Till that happens, the Railways jurisdiction in Mangaluru should be given to Mysuru division. Mysuru division of the South Western Railways is much closer than Palakkad of Mangaluru. The people of Mangaluru will be benefited out of this,” he said.
 
 Minister of State in the Ministry of Railways Rajen Gohain said completion of projects depend on a number of factors such as acquisition of land, forestry and wildlife clearances, shifting of various services, construction of road over-bridges/road under-bridges by road maintenance departments, apart from availability of adequate funds.
