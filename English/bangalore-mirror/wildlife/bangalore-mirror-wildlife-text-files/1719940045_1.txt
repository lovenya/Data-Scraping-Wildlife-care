Swayam Jagruti, a volunteer group, held a postcard signature campaign against the proposed 236 km broad-gauge railway line that will run through Bandipur National Park.

The campaign was held at Gandhi Bhavan in Bangalore University, where volunteers gathered to collect post cards with signatures from many walking enthusiasts around the Bangalore University campus. Ajay Kumar C, President of Swayam Jagruti, said that the event was successful, with the volunteers being able to collect more than hundred of post cards with signatures. Around 200 of the collected postcards will be collated and sent to Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
 
The railway line has been proposed with the objective of connecting Nilambur in Kerala to Nanjangudi in Karnataka. However, wildlife experts have raised their concerns over the potential ecological impact of the railway line if the project is implemented, effecting Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks. The Kerala government has reasoned the proposal with the project’s potential to improve interstate connectivity, resulting in significantly reducing the time required to travel between the two states as the distance is reduced. 

The railway line would also, as a side effect, reduce traffic congestion on the National Highway-766, connecting Kozhikode in Kerala to Kollegal in Karnataka’s Chamarajanagar district, according to the project proposal.

Since the proposal, environmentalists under the banner ‘Save Bandipur’ have been advocating for the preservation of the Bandipur forest. Many awareness campaigns such as the postcard signature camping about the potential impact of the proposed railway project on the forest are been carried out.
