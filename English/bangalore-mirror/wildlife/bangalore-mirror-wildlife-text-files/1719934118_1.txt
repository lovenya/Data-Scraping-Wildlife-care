This is about the cover story, 'Forget safari, better flock to theme parks' on Bangalore Mirror on Friday. There is only one place near Bangalore where our children can watch wild animals and learn about their behaviour - the Bannerghatta National Park. This wildlife sanctuary is also visited by people from rural areas who come to Bangalore. All over the world, authorities attract visitors to places of interest by charging minimum entry fees. But in our state, the practice seems to be different. It is unfortunate that instead of reducing the Rs 40 entry fee to the national park — which is already too much for the common man — our forest department has decided to increase the same to Rs 200. Hiking the entry fee to a national park by five times at one go shows the anti-poor attitude of our rulers as it will now cost a family of four Rs 800 for a visit to the park.

Is the government trying to discourage people from visiting the national park? A five-fold increase in the entry fee is ridiculous and unfair. Once the people stop visiting the place, no corrective measure can bring the place back into the tourism map.
