If you think only poachers hunt animals, you are wrong. 

There have been at least 142 hunting cases in Cauvery wildlife sanctuary since January this year, most of the animals were killed by miscreants disguised as trekkers. 

Forest department officials suspect that the unaccounted cases may be twice the number, which has never been reported. 

Out of the 142 hunting cases, 106 are booked under forest offence.

According to sources, there are a number of websites that try to entice people from places like Bengaluru to enter the forests. When the miscreants enter deep inside the forest, they resort to hunting activities with no guard around. 

The forest staff says the maximum number of hunting took place during the lockdown.
