The animals were allegedly overfed subabul tree leaves that are rich in amino acids

As many as 31 spotted deer died at a park near here in the past few days due to indigestion caused by excessive consumption of subabul tree leaves, which are rich in protein and have mimusin, a toxic amino acid.

While 17 deer died on November 1, eight perished the next day. Another six died on Saturday. Twenty-five of them were female and some were also pregnant, forest officials said.

There were about 180 deer in the park which were being taken care of by their keepers. Officials were now keeping an eye on the rest.

Postmortem of a couple of deer revealed the cause of the deaths, following which the keepers have been asked not to feed subabul leaves to the remaining, the official said.

According to the official, the keepers overfed the deer in their enthusiasm as the animals ate the leaves with relish.

Officials were now providing certain type of grass, besides a concoction, including powdered pepper, and drinking water for the rest of the herd as a preventive measure.


‘China’s ease on tiger, rhino trade may cost India’

Wildlife experts have urged the government to be vigilant against poaching of tigers and rhinos after China eased a 25-year ban on the trade of body parts of the animals.

According to them, the decision is likely to have “grave and devastating” implications for tiger and rhino conservation in India.

“People involved in illegal wildlife trade of tiger bones and rhino horns might target the wild populations in India. Our country, with 60 per cent and 85 per cent of global populations of wild tigers and greater one-horned rhinos respectively, will be under threat of poaching,” said Dipankar Ghose, director-species and landscapes programme at WWF-India Secretariat.

India has 2,226 tigers and 3,500 rhinos are left in both India and Nepal.
