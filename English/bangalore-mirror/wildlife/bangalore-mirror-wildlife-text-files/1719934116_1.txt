The entry fee to Bannerghatta has been hiked from Rs 40 to Rs 200. The hike will come into effect from February 1          
The entry fee which was Rs 40 has been raised to Rs 200 and will, along with the other hikes, come into force from February 1.

The forest department’s decision comes at a time when the tourism department is going all out to promote wildlife tourism in the state and is likely to work at cross-purpose with the latter.

B K Singh, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), however, defended the decision saying that it would not affect the tourism potential of national parks. “It was discussed in a meeting with the principal secretary, forest ecology and environment. Tourists are spending a lot of money on lodging, food and transport. As compared to this, the entry fee to national parks and other fees charged by us are meagre. If they could afford that, then they can pay for this as well. Besides, it has been four years since we hiked the tariff,” he told Bangalore Mirror.

More than the fee hike, what is going to seriously impact hordes of Bangalore’s wildlife enthusiasts is the ban on trekking inside the park. It’s a great stress-buster and the favourite pastime of lots of techies in the city.  
DOUBLING THE REVENUES
The annual collection from assorted fees charged by the forest department, which was around Rs 7 crore, is now expected to double. The fees collected from the tiger reserves will go to the tiger conservation trust, while fees from other sanctuaries will be utilised by the department to provide better amenities for tourists at those places, Singh explained.

The revised list from the forest department bans trekking in Bannerghatta, Bandipur, Nagarhole, Anshi and Biligiri Ranga Temple wildlife sanctuary. Photography has been banned. 
TIGER DIES
Meanwhile yet another tiger, 12-year-old Tejaswini, died of brain haemorrhage in the Bannerghatta Park, taking the total tiger deaths in the recent past to eight.
