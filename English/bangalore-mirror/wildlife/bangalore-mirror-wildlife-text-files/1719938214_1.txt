The Maharashtra forest department sleuths have arrested a 24-year-old man from Bengaluru, who was moonlighting as a garments salesman, but was smuggling and trading of exotic wildlife and bird species. The accused Mohammed Khaleel Riyaz Ahmed was arrested in Thane on Tuesday afternoon while he was de-boarding a train with his parcel consignment. 

The seized consignment consisted of four Indian star tortoises, three falcons, one black shouldered kite, one Eurasian eagle owl and two Iguanas. 

Ahmed, who is a native of Gandhinagar in KG Halli, had boarded the Coimbatore (Kurla) Express train on Monday from the city.

Range Forest Officer (RFO) Thane, Narendra Muthe, had information that Ahmed will be travelling with a parcel consignment of exotic wildlife and bird species on Coimbatore (Kurla) Express. “We had information that the accused was travelling with exotic wildlife and bird species which are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.”

Preliminary inquiries revealed Ahmed had procured these exotic wildlife species around the city and smuggled them via train, to sell them in Mumbai. While smuggling exotic birds and wildlife, he pretended to be a garments salesman, the forest officials said.
