The high-security North Block area near Parliament had an unusual visitor, a Nilgai, which was rescued on Thursday afternoon. The Nilgai, suspected to have strayed from Central Forest Reserve Area located on the backside of the President's Estate, was first spotted during early hours of the day and rescued around 2:15pm, state forest department officials said. As soon as the Nilgai was spotted, a police team was rushed to the area, where VVIP movement was to start in a while. The animal was seen running and a PCR van was tasked with chasing it towards the lawns there.
 
 
 	While the van was about to take a sharp turn, the Nilgai suddenly ran towards it and hit the vehicle on the driver's side. The impact led to a broken window glass and injury to the Nilgai.
 	
 	  	Officials said the female adult blue bull has sustained injuries on her legs.
 	
 	  	“She (the Nilgai) has some injuries on her legs. As per initial report, it seems that she had come from Central Forest Reserve Area located on the backside of the President Estate,” chief wildlife warden A K Shukla said.
 	
 	  	The officer further said the department is yet to ascertain her age and whether the animal is pregnant or not.
