A leopard which had sneaked inside Bangalore University’s Jnanabharathi campus a few days back has created panic among the public. The forest department had laid a trap to catch the animal but in vain. According to the residents of Kumbalgod near Kengeri, they spotted the leopard roaming in their vicinity. “I saw the leopard just a few meters away on Saturday in the Uttarahalli Main road. The leopard ran away towards the forest near BGS hospital,” said Ninagappa, a resident. 

“The leopard took away a Pomeranian dog from the nearby tea shop on Saturday night. A few police persons also have spotted the leopard at nights. Forest department officials and wildlife volunteers are comparing its pugmarks with the ones found in the Jnanabharathi campus,” said a police officer.
