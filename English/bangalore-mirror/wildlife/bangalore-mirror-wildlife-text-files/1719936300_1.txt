Post-the great leopard escape, Bannerghatta National Park to install 50 cameras to monitor wildlife
 
 
 The mysterious escape of a rescued leopard from the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) and subsequent search operation had exposed lapses in monitoring wildlife movement within Bannerghatta National Park (BNP). Determined to avoid a repeat of the episode, the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD) has decided to install camera traps in all the four ranges.  	The BNP is divided into four wildlife ranges—Anekal, Bannerghatta, Harohalli and Kodihalli. A total of 50 cameras will be set up within the 260.51 sq km spread across three districts of Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural and Ramanagara. The camera traps, with the latest technology to film animals, will not only provide live feed to officials on everyday movement of the animals, but also help in alerting the nearby public.  	Giving details of the project, Dr Sunil Panwar, deputy conservator of forests, BNP, told Bangalore Mirror the project would be implemented by the end of May. “The leopard escape episode was the flash point for us to think on scientific lines to monitor wildlife movement within BNP. Currently, except for pug marks, we do not have any proof to conclude an animal has disappeared into the wild. Had the cameras been in place, the animal would have been easily captured in any of the locations. This apart, the camera trap system will help us to check rising incidents of man-animal conflict on the outskirts of Bengaluru,” Dr Panwar explained.  	Though incidents of crop damage by wildlife have come down drastically, deaths are on a steady rise around BNP. “This year alone we have witnessed four deaths due to man-animal conflict. We are keen on curbing these numbers with the help of the latest technology. We have already identified 50 places within the four ranges to install cameras and preliminary checks have been carried out by field staffers. We are in the process of purchasing cameras required for the project,” the officer revealed.  	  	Interchangeable flash!  	Though it is common for the forest department to use cameras for census work of tigers or leopards to prove presence of animals in a given territory, this is the first time camera traps will be used just to monitor wildlife movement. Dr Panwar said unlike other national parks, BNP serves as a transit place for several wildlife species. “More than tigers, BNP has a large presence of Asiatic elephants that require constant monitoring. There are different varieties of cameras and while a few have infra-red flashes, others use light flash. There are chances that animals or poachers moving around could either be alerted or scared by the light flash. Hence, the cameras we are purchasing will have interchangeable flash and we can choose between flash types.”  	Officials at BNP revealed each camera would cost Rs 16,000-Rs 17,000 along with metal boxes and other accessories. Data will be retrieved on daily basis by trained field staff. A total of Rs 10 lakh has been set aside for the project. Department sources are positive the camera traps will yield better results than radio collaring as they will help establish the identity of the animal based on pictorial evidence.  	
 	‘Hejje’ software  	The indigenously developed ‘Hejje’ software that has been successfully implemented by the KFD to track big cats in tiger reserves will be used in BNP to monitor elephants and other carnivores.  	“The software will be downloaded on devices like mobiles and i-Pads carried by officials and personnel Dr Panwar explained
