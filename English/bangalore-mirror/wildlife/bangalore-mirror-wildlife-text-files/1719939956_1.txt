Nagarhole and Bandipur in Karnataka are renowned all over the country and across the world among wildlife enthusiasts as exceptional sanctuaries. Now the state is set to replicate that success with the introduction of a novel tiger safari zone in the Old Mysore region, in Chamarajanagar, the southernmost district. With this, Karnataka is hoping to boost the economy of the region and give its tourism landscape a major revamp.
 
The safari is currently in the pilot stage.
 
Wildlife in the area includes tigers, leopards, Indian hare, sambar and spotted deer, Indian gaur and a large variety of avian species. The route also runs along the elephant corridor, making encounters with wild elephants a possibility.

According to reports, the safari will start in the PG Palya Range from Lokkanahalli and stretch 18 kilometres to the wildlife division with the Male Mahadeshwara Hills, and will take wildlife lovers through dense jungle and allow them to appreciate the diverse wildlife in the area. The route is also known to host a number of significant structures from the Stone Age including an anti-poaching camp and burial grounds, making this safari a draw for history buffs as well.

The tiger safari plan is part of a proposed Kollegal tourist circuit that will allow visitors to explore a variety of attractions in a single day, including the Bharachukki Falls (above), Gundal Dam and the Dhondenling Tibetan camp.
