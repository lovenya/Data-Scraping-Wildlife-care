In a swift and commendable action, People For Animals’ (PfA) Quick Rescue Reaction Team (QRRT) saved the life of an injured spotted deer near a petrol bunk adjacent to JSS College Hostel in the city.

Upon receiving a call about the displaced animal on June 21, the QRRT reached the site, located just 1.5 kilometres from their shelter, to find the injured deer, likely from an attack by feral dogs. Understanding the delicate nature of the situation, the team took swift action to keep the animal’s stress levels low. The adult male spotted deer, known for its shy behaviour and high susceptibility to stress-related conditions, received on-site first aid under the guidance of veterinarian Dr Madhav.

The team, which included Dr Madhav, Rahul, Vasanth, Mohan, Bharath, Anand, Gokul, and volunteers Rohan and Vedanth, along with Karnataka Forest Department officials, efficiently handled the situation. They treated the deer’s bite injuries with necessary medications to prevent infection and promote healing before releasing it back into the wilderness. “It was crucial to treat the deer on-site and ensure a quick release back into the wild to prevent capture myopathy, a common condition caused by stress and physical strain that can be fatal for wild animals,” explained Dr Sharif.

Beat forest officer Soumya praised the PfA team for their efficiency and quick response, said, “Despite the challenges, including injuries to some team members, the rescue was a success. This rescue highlights the critical role of trained professionals and well-equipped rescue teams in ensuring the safety and well-being of wildlife.”
 
Colonel Dr Sharif commended his team’s efforts, stating, “Our team’s dedication and expertise were key in saving the deer’s life. Quick and effective actions in such cases are vital for the survival of these animals.”

Previous notable rescues by PfA QRRT include a challenging operation involving a young leopard near Turahalli Forest Reserve, which was successfully reunited with its mother, and another spotted deer rescue near Kempegowda International Airport.
