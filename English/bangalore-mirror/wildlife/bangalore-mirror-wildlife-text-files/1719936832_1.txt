Over a year after a leopard straying into Vibgyor School in Whitefield, the incident has returned to haunt the Karnataka Forest Department (KFD). The issue of compensation to the victims in the rescue operation has now snowballed into a controversy.
 
 
 
  The Feb 2016 encounter
 
 Noted wildlife conservationist Sanjay Gubbi and forest personnel were attacked by the panicking leopard, leaving them severely injured. Although Gubbi did not claim compensation from the department, forest minister B Ramanatha Rai on Wednesday told the legislative council in a written reply that “Gubbi had not submitted the bills of the hospital in a proper format.” BJP MLC Lahar Singh Siroya had asked the government for reasons for not paying compensation to Gubbi although he had requested for ex-gratia amount like any other victim.
 
 Ramanatha Rai said, “Gubbi had not submitted his treatment bills as per rules. Hence, the department could not reimburse the cost. However, Benna Monis, driver with KFD, too, was injured and had submitted a bill of Rs 5,928, and the same has been reimbursed.” Lahar Singh later told Bangalore Mirror, “Gubbi refused to take the compensation and had only claimed ex-gratia amount of Rs 20,000. Government clarified it can pay ex-gratia amount to the victim injured in wildlife attack based on prima facie facts, but requires proper format to claim reimbursement of the cost of treatment. But in this issue, the KFD officials have blatantly misguided the minister,” he said.
 
 Gubbi clarified that he had claimed only ex-gratia amount, not hospital expenditure to be reimbursed. A forest officer approached him promising reimbursement and he responded on February 24, 2016 requesting only ex-gratia as applicable to any common man injured during such situations as per existing laws, rules and guidelines.
