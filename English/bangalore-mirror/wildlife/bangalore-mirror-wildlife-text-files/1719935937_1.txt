A 700 kg bull that was suffering from abnormal hooves was a relieved lot after a 9-hour long pedicure session, thanks to a team of 10 city volunteers who successfully carried out the task of handling an untamed bull.
 
 The animal had been in pain for months and experts had opined that it would lead to lameness due to dysfunction of locomotor system if unaddressed.
 
 The city wildlife volunteers, led by Shashidhar, had taken up the case after a rescue call.
 
 On Friday, the exercise turned fruitful with the bull relieved of its pain after the end of the session that could have taken a dangerous turn if it had gone wrong, those who were part of the exercise told Bangalore Mirror.
 
 The first steps in the exercise were taken fifteen days ago when two local residents were given the task to get friendly with the bull.
 
 After the groundwork, the exercise started at 6.30 when the bull was lured to the designated place.
 
 The bull that usually walks in and around Konankunte was drawn to Silver Oak yard in Konankunte Cross.
 
 But there were tense moments when the vet approached the bull to tranquillise it.
 
 “Sensing that something was amiss with the vet’s movement, the bull started to move swiftly around the area. It took three hours for us to control it and inject the tranquiliser,” Vijay explained.
 
 The bull was tied and controlled by ten people.
 
 The hooves were brought back to a normal shape, with the abnormally grown parts cut and the hooves trimmed. After this, the hooves were given medication.
 
 The bull relieved of its pain was a sight to watch, explained volunteers, adding it was no longer struggling to walk.
