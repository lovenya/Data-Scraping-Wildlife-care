Elephant deaths

While Hindus worship Lord Ganesha, the Elephant God, at the outset of all good events, they at the same time do away with elephants on a large scale in a ruthless manner by electrocuting them. 

Natural laws weigh all earthly beings on an equal scale and give equal freedom of existence to both mankind and its fellow beings. 

The spate of gruesome killings of pachyderms  — a docile species that performs sacred services in Hindu shrines — has 
now assumed such alarming proportions that the Karnataka High Court has had to intervene and demand an explanation from the authorities in the state and the Centre for the cause behind the deaths.

The death under mysterious circumstances of 24 elephants in about six months coupled with that of eight within hardly a week does raise the hackles of the hoi polloi of Karnataka in general and of all animal welfare activists elsewhere. 

When such issues as killing of tuskers, culling of stray dogs and the like have to reach the High Court for a solution, it is a discredit to the state administrative machinery to have refrained from taking stringent action against the guilty farmers. 
It is also to be blamed for having failed to ensure abidance of the wildlife rules by the general public in Karnataka.
