In response to the massive influx of trekkers to the Kumara Parvatha trek in Karnatakaâ€™s Pushpagiri forest on January 26, the government has implemented a temporary ban on trekking paths lacking an online booking system to prevent overcrowding in the forest.

The Karnataka Forest Department has issued a temporary ban on trekking in forest areas starting February 1 until standard operating procedures are established. Trekking will be permitted only in 23 designated places with operational online booking systems.

In response, the Minister of Forests, Biology, and Environment, Ishwar Khandre, has issued clear instructions to the Chief Conservator of Forests and the Chief of the Forest Task Force. He emphasized that the increasing trend of thousands of trekkers arriving weekly in densely forested hilly areas, particularly the Western Ghats with rich biodiversity, poses risks to the environment and water sources. This surge has led to overcrowding, especially on weekends.

In a communication to the head of the forest task force, Khandre highlighted the recent rise in youth engaging in trekking to forested mountain peaks. He expressed concerns about littering, including the indiscriminate disposal of plastic carry bags, bottles, plates, and leftover food items in villages on the forest edges and ecologically sensitive areas, posing a threat to wildlife.

Khandre acknowledged the challenges faced by the forest department staff in managing and monitoring such a large number of people. Additionally, he mentioned reports of some trekkers camping overnight in tents without online bookings, particularly in trekking spots like Kumara Parvatha and Thukkanninagudda where no online booking system is in place.

To address these issues, Ishwar Khandre proposed a temporary suspension of trekking until proper arrangements are made. Currently, the Eco-Tourism Department of the Forest Department allows only 150 trekkers on the designated paths with available bookings.
