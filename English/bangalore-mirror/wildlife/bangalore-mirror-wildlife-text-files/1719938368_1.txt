Imagine how a deer would feel after falling through the roof of a house. Or how you'd feel when the rooftop of your house breaks and a deer suddenly lands in your house. Well, it is no longer a matter of dreams as a large spotted deer fell on a roof, crashed through it and landed in a house in a slum on Sunday. The incident occurred at the Hanuman Tekdi slum colony, adjacent to the IIT-Bombay campus.

It is suspected that the deer ended up in the house after a chase from its predator, a hungry leopard. During the chase, the deer apparently slipped down the hillock onto the roof, broke it and landed on the floor of the house.

The deer was safely rescued after being surrounded by hundreds of slum dwellers by a seven-member team of the Mumbai Range of Forest Department and a team of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) led by Pawan Sharma. "It was immediately taken to Sanjay Gandhi National Park's Rescue Centre for further medical examination and rehabilitation," Sharma said.
