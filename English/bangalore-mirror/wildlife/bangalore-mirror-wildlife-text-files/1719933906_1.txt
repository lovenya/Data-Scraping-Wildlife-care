Land Cruiser
This all-terrain 4WD is what you are bound to travel in when you go on a desert safari in the Middle East or on a wildlife safari in Kenya. But will shifting sands and wild animals give the car enough ammo to weave through the city traffic? At least you can look like Bollywood stars (Salman Khan, John Abraham have this car) when in it. It costs Rs 1.03 crore. In the Middle East, its price is equivalent of Rs 30 lakh but the export and other duties make it dearer.

Land Cruiser Prado
Smaller than the Land Cruiser, it costs about Rs 60 lakh. If you are among those who have booked this 4WD without test-driving it or even seeing it, then in say, 10 daysâ€™ time, you can hit the roads with this car, powered by its 3-litre engine. It is imported from Japan.

Fortuner
By sourcing parts from Thailand and assembling the car in India, almost a Rs 10 lakh discount is passed on to the market. Buzz has it that the company has stopped taking orders for now as each dealer has about 300-400 pending orders. An SUV that runs on diesel, this is not so rough on your budget. It is priced at Rs 23 lakh.

Toyota Q World is on at Gayatri Vihar, Palace Grounds on Sunday from 10 am to 6 pm. 

Prius
Clearly a scene stealer, its multi-info display screen at the centre of the dashboard is made of recycled materials. The screen tells you about the battery life, car speed and how your driving is affecting the mileage. Watch if you accelerate to speed up or brake to slow down. The screen will let you know that it is probably not the best way to maximise the mileage. There is an exclusive heads-up display for the driver that shows the speed you had promised you would stay on along with the actual speed. The engine automatically switches off the moment this Rs 33 lakh, auto-geared car is idle. This car talks to the key and opens as you approach it.
