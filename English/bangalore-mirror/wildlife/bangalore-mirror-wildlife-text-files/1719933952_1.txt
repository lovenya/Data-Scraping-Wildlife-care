Yet, Police Commissioner Shankar Bidari and his men seemed oblivious to the fact when solving a kidnapping case.

Lucky charm

The police gave a clean chit to Doddagangolappa and his son, a 10th standard student, who had a Red Sand Boa, a rare species of snake which is considered a lucky charm. When asked, Bidari said rescuing the kidnapped 17-year-old boy was our priority. “Keeping snakes at home is a minor thing for us,” he said.

The police said no case had been registered against people who kept snakes in their homes. A gang of seven had kidnapped the boy on June 6. The kidnappers, who wanted to steal the Red Sand Boa snake from Doddagangolappa, told him they had found a similar species near Paragodu Cross and asked him to come there with the snake that he had.

Kidnap for ransom

When Doddagangolappa sent his son to meet them, the gang kidnapped him and demanded he pay Rs 10 lakh as ransom within 12 hours. He complained to the Sampigehalli police, who traced the kidnappers and arrested them.

The boy, who had been locked up by the gang in Hegdenagar, was rescued and the snakes seized from their possession. On questioning, kidnappers said these snakes would help them in finding treasure.

Murder plot

According to the police, the gang was planning to kill the boy after getting the ransom. The arrested are: Ayub Pasha, 37; Nawaz Pasha, 30; Samir Pahsa, 24; Nasir, 27; Ayaz Ulla, 22; and Nasir, 27.

Meanwhile, the process is on to hand over the two snakes seized from kidnappers to the forest department.
