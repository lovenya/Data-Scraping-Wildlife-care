Tumakuru police on Monday afternoon shot dead a sloth bear after it mauled a man to death. The incident happened near Cheelanahalli in Madhugiri taluk of the district. 

 	Giving details, MV Amarnath, Deputy Conservator of Forests said, “Somanna (40), a resident of Garani village in Madhugiri taluk, had gone to forest area to fetch cactus to erect a fence around his cowshed. The bear inside a nearby bush attacked him. When Somanna fought back with an iron rod, it mauled him to death. Others rushed to help, and the bear began attacking them as well. Another villager Sanna Thimmaiah (50) was severely injured in his scalp and was rushed to Victoria Hospital for treatment.” Police then shot dead the bear. 

 	As per the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972, an animal can only be killed with a written permission by the Chief Wildlife Warden of the state. 

 	Vinay Luthra, PCCF (Wildlife) told BM, “I have not issued any permission to shoot the bear and I will get report from my officials from the district and any violation of the act will be dealt with severely.” 

 

 	Man-eater tiger caught 	A tiger which had mauled a 32-woman to death was caught by the forest department on Monday. As the locals were heaving a sigh of relief over the catch, another tiger was spotted nearby. 

 	On Saturday, Sumitra, who was walking towards an estate was attacked by a tiger and dragged to a nearby bush. Since then, the forest department had launched a hunt for the tiger with limited success. In fact, the forest department had laid the trap by keeping a sheep as bait at the same place. 

 	However, when the forest officials came back on Sunday morning, they were shocked to see that the tiger had not  	touched the bait though it had killed two cattle on the same place.
