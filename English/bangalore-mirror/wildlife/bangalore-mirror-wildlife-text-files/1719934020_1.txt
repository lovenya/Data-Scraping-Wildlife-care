“We will soon declare elephant as a national heritage animal as they have been part of our heritage since ages. We need to give same degree of importance to elephant as is given to tiger in order to protect the big animal,” Ramesh said. 

The 12-member panel said that there were over 25,000 elephants in the country, including 3,500 in captivity in zoos and temples, particularly in southern and north-eastern parts of the country. 

Ramesh also said Wildlife (Protection) Act would also be amended to pave way for setting up of National Elephants 
Conservation Authority (NECA) on the lines of the NTCA that has been constituted for the tiger conservation, as suggested by a panel. Ramesh underlined the urgency to protect the jumbos in the country before they could go the tiger ways whose count stand just around 1,411.
