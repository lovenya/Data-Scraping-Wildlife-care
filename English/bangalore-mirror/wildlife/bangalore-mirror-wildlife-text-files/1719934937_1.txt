First it was incredibly hot summers and shrinking lakes which kept migratory birds away. Now, birds which thrived on the outskirts of the city are being forced to take refuge in urban spots. While the variety of wings and feathers has been an eyeful for keen bird watchers and ornithologists, the trend is deeply worrying. 
   People For Animals (PFA) say that until now, rescues usually involved common birds such as crows, black kites, barn owls, mynas, egrets, koels and barbets. But now, wildlife volunteers are increasingly rescuing birds such as the hoopoe, house swift, green bee-eater, Indian roller, mottled wood owl, collared scops owl, shikra, coppersmith barbet, cormorant and golden-backed woodpecker. In May-June this year, more than nine such birds were rescued. 
   PFA believes that a change in landscape —loss of green cover, disappearing lakes, drying rivers and agricultural fields gradually becoming residential or commercial spots —in areas where they habitually nest, is the reason for these birds moving into the city. 
   “These birds are not rare,” C H Kishan, manager, PFA told Bangalore Mirror. “They are very common on the outskirts of the city. What is not common is that they are increasingly being rescued in the city. For example, a common hoopoe was recently rescued at Jnanabharati campus. It was a first for wildlife volunteers and rescuers. Likewise, several such species of birds were rescued in May and June. They were rescued after being injured.” Experts say one of the reasons for injury is that when these birds move into new territory, they are attacked by ‘local’ birds. Chinese manja also contributes to injuries. The number of these ‘uncommon’ rescues has gradually increased from nil to an average of four in May and June. 
   “These are local migratory birds and they nest in green patches,” Kishan said. “With a change in the topography, they are forced to move in search of green patches and are ending up in the city.”
