Away from the bustling activities that provided Bangaloreans with wholesome entertainment over the weekend, the city had a surprise visitor on Saturday.

The normally shy and nocturnal primate, slender loris, turned up at Nagarbhavi, providing excitement to 
children and the general public of the area.

Spotted on Saturday afternoon by a group of children from Annapoorneshwari Nagar, in Nagarbhavi limits, the public’s initial curiosity soon gave way to cruelty, much to the dismay of loris, who would now think twice before planning unwanted cameos.

While a few decided that its appearance was inauspicious, others decided to put thought to action, pelting stones and injuring the poor creature, which sought refuge in the dark confines of a drain.

Luckily for the loris, an animal lover and resident of the area, Ramya, spotted its predicament and duly alerted People For Animals (PFA).

By 2.30 pm, G Praveen, a volunteer with PFA rescued the loris from the drain. Later, speaking to Bangalore Mirror, he said, “Loris is a quiet nocturnal animal and the darkness inside the drainage might have attracted it. When we rescued the loris, it had injuries on the leg and fingers. When we diagnosed the animal further, we found that it was also suffering from eye infections.”

After administering first aid, the animal was taken to PFA Animal Hospice at Kengeri. The PFA sources said that the condition of the loris had improved on Sunday and that it was reacting well to the treatment. 

Last month, the PFA volunteers had rescued another slender loris from near the Electronic City. Slender loris is protected under the Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and has been a target for poachers. The endangered animal is found only in South India and Sri Lanka.
