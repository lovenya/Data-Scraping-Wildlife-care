Four dead in past 36 hours, efforts are being made to free up encroachments

As many as four elephants have died in the forest regions of southeastern Karnataka within the past 36 hours. One elephant was discovered deceased in the Cauvery River that flows through the Gopinatham forest, situated on the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Surendra, the deputy conservator of forests at Cauvery Wild Sanctuary, mentioned that the elephant appeared to have slipped and fallen into the water. However, a definitive cause of death awaits confirmation through forensic analysis.

Wildlife activist and former member of the state wildlife board, Joseph Hoover, said, “Another elephant, an 11-year-old tusker, died near Kanakapura, adjacent to Bannerghatta National Park. Ganesh, the assistant CF for Kanakapura division, reported that the tusker’s intestine was obstructed due to undigested mangoes, leading to its demise. Additionally, a tuskless male elephant passed away in the Kodihalli range of Bannerghatta National Park, while another elephant died from dehydration in Ramnagar on Sunday.”

Wildlife activists said that wild elephants are in perilous danger, especially in and around Bengaluru. Illegal snares pose a threat to these animals, causing wounds that often require care.
 
Forest department officials mentioned that the elephant corridor would not only prevent human-animal conflicts but also reduce financial burdens. Last year, a wild elephant died near the Kanakapura road after being hit by a BMTC bus. This incident occurred on the elephant corridor leading towards Bannerghatta. While it may sound strange to Bengalureans that there is an elephant corridor around the city, frequent elephant sightings indicate that the concrete jungle has encroached upon the real jungle, putting animals at risk. These incidents have pressurised the forest department to take up the initiative to create a secure elephant corridor around Bengaluru.

Some time ago, the Bengaluru district administration completed a survey of elephant corridors in the city, including the surrounding areas of Bannerghatta National Park. This aimed to clear illegal encroachments and develop an elephant corridor. A senior official said, “We conducted a survey in Shivanahalli village, survey number 69, covering 1,000 acres around Bannerghatta National Park. The forest department must now decide on the best ways to protect the elephants. Shivanahalli, a revenue village, cannot be evicted, and the forest department must decide on the next course of action. 

Efforts are being made to free up encroachments, especially agricultural ones. An eco-sensitive zone within a one-kilometre radius of the elephant corridor has been identified, with restrictions on certain activities. Noise pollution in the area has been controlled, and there are plans to restrict vehicle movements at night, similar to Bandipur and Nagarahole. Alternatives for commuters need to be identified, and if vehicle movement can’t be restricted at night, measures like signboards and speed breakers are considered. Government lands are being repurposed for colleges, hostels, waste processing units, and other utilities.”

Various organisations have demanded the completion of the survey for the 1,000 acres of the elephant corridor and the release of 232 acres of land to the forest department. Green activists stress the importance of protecting Bannerghatta. It is reported that around 3,000 farmers in and around Sakleshpur have expressed willingness to sell their land for creating an elephant corridor. Forest officials consider this a welcome move that should be replicated elsewhere.
