ICCWC will then convene the first global meeting of wildlife enforcement networks on 5 March 2013 (see concept note), in support of a more coordinated enforcement response. The purpose of the meeting is for existing and proposed networks to discuss the need for a global system to improve coordination and effectiveness and to consider the role that ICCWC, together with other partners, could play in such a system. The high-level events will focus on the importance of high-level political commitment to combating wildlife crime and the need for enhanced coordination among enforcement authorities at the regional, subregional and national level. The Secretary-General of CITES, John E. Scanlon, stressed that “Illegal trade in wildlife is escalating, is transnational, and is increasingly well-organized. Our collective response needs to be commensurate with the nature of the risk at both the political and operational levels”. The events have been made possible thanks to the generous contributions of the Governments of Sweden and the United States of America (through the Department of State).
