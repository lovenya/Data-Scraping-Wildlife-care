The event highlighted that there are appropriate international legal instruments in place to tackle both crimes (CITES, UNCAC, UNTOC), as well as ground-level initiatives. The event also showcased an increased determination among Member States to treat this issue as a priority, such as an example provided by the government of Kenya. The speakers emphasized that the scale and scope of corruption in this area requires far more coordinated efforts in its prevention and there is a strong necessity to address it through the entire chain (poaching, selling, transportation and end markets). The States were called to adopt risk approaches and integrity policies at the institutional level that would serve as a deterrent to corruption in the wildlife and forestry sector and would be mainstreamed into broader national anti-corruption efforts.
