Migratory animals are some of the most marvellous creatures we could ever behold on this earth. With no access to compasses or any navigational instrumentation, they are able to navigate vast distances. From the physics-defying migration of the salmon to the awe-inspiring distances covered by Caribou, these journeys do inspire us to consider just how sensational nature is. Among the animals that cover the longest distances, birds often fly the longest distances. Quite a few of these amazing migratory birds call various regions of India their home during different parts of the year. Of the birds that do, some of the most fascinating ones visit our country in the summer and give us a great reason to travel to places where we can see them. Here are 5 migratory birds that visit India in the summer and where you can see these fascinating creatures.
