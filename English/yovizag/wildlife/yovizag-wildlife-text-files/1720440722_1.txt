When people think of travel, some jet off to the Andamans, while others travel the nooks and corners of India, sit by the pool or the beach and sip martinis. And then there’s you, the unicorn, who wants to ‘go somewhere’ but doesn’t know where. We bring a travel guide to South India for you, the lazy, rebellious, brave, non-conformists who’re tired of the regular old vacation places but just don’t know where to go! Here are the 6 must visit places in South India. Located around Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh, is the second largest cave in the Indian subcontinent. It is popular for its stalactite and stalagmite formations with extended chambers, outstretched shafts, fresh water galleries, and siphons. This place is well maintained, drawing in hordes of tourists. These waterfalls are located by the Kaveri river in the Dharmapuri districts of Tamil Nadu. The falls are also known as ‘The Niagara falls of India’ and are a good option for a short budget trip. The path has got everything from numerous ancient temples to boat rides. Check out the freshly fried fish sold at the shore during boat rides. Skandagiri Hills are located about 60 km from Bengaluru. It is an authentic halting-place for a one-day expedition.

Also known as Coconut Island and Thonsepar, these are a set of small islands in the Arabian Sea; off the coast of Malpe in Udipi. A perfect destination for beach lovers with an absolutely ravishing, small outstretched section of land. The scenic view, calm shores, coconut trees and radiant sea with clouds rebounding on them makes the island fascinating.
