The Visakhapatnam Port Trust is on the verge of closing bids for the construction of Andhra Pradesh’s first international cruise terminal. This will then bring mid-sea leisure combined with popular tourist spots tours onshore. Earlier this year, Silver Discoverer, an international cruise liner was brought to Visakhapatnam with 100 tourists from the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. This set the path to constructing the terminal between the channel berth and Vedanta General Cargo Berth. The tours will cover Vizag’s golden beaches, and lush-green, hillocks all around the Eastern Ghats, coffee gardens at Araku and Anantagiri, the million-year-old Borra Caves and the 17th-century Dutch township of Bheemili. Added attractions will include the tours of the Buddhist sites spread all over Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. Extended tours to Kakinada’s Hope Island and Coringa wildlife sanctuary, Yanam’s Eiffel Tower replica, and the famous Simhachalam and Annavaram temples are also in the pipeline. “We are on verge of finalising tenders. A terminal of international standards will be constructed. We are setting an 18-month deadline to complete it,” Visakhapatnam Port Trust Chairman M.T. Krishna Babu told The Hindu. The project will cost ₹80 crore for which the Ministry of Tourism will give a grant of ₹40 crore. “We will spend the remaining amount,” Mr Krishna Babu further added. The project will have an overall length of 300 metres to accommodate cruise liners with capacities of carrying 1,500 passengers, a swimming pool, dance floors, sports and games, wellness centres along with multi-cuisine 24×7 restaurants.
