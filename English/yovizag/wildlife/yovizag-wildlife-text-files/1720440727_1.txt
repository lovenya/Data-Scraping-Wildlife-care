Visakhapatnam is fast emerging as a major tourist destination in Andhra Pradesh. While nature cover, which includes lush green hills and deep blue waters, held our captive since times immemorial, multiple water sports brought in by the officials have bolstered the city’s fame as a tourist heaven for many. Here are 4 such exciting water sports that you can’t miss in Visakhapatnam. Scuba diving in India has been restricted to popular destinations such as Goa, Pondicherry, and Andaman islands among others. The feasible connectivity and the huge potential can cause Visakhapatnam to emerge as one of the major scuba diving destinations in the country, and possibly the world. Also, an international scuba diving academy is slated to be established in the city with the support of the government. This is the perfect destination for an adventure holiday underwater! For a sneak-peek of marine life, you could indulge in the simplest of all underwater activities, snorkelling. The blue waters of the Bay of Bengal come calling with this adventurous activity at Rushikonda. Hop onto the powerful water scooters and ride the waves with the wind in your face. This might just be the best thing you could experience at few of the city’s wildlife sanctuaries. Paddling your way into a beautiful lake cocooned in greenery, the calmness and beauty around you are so attractive and appealing that you do not want to leave. The nature around you seems to come alive when you ride a kayak into that beautiful lake.
