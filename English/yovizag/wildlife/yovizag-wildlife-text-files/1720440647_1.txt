It’s World Environment Day on June 5th, and the Zoo brigade – a volunteer service organization for zoo and conservation of wildlife is commemorating the event at a local level. In association with the Indira Gandhi zoological park and following the theme of ‘Connecting people to nature’, the event will be marked with a seminar conducted at the zoo premises. With the theme calling people to get outdoors and protect the earth that we all share, the seminar would address relevant issues in the form of discussions. Participants from 11th standard to undergraduates are invited to join the event, which will be held on 4th of June at the zoo bioscope. The Indira Gandhi zoological park, located amidst the Kambalakonda Reserve forest stretches across 625 acres and is home to approximately 80 species of animals. With different sections allocated for carnivores, reptiles, birds and other animals, the zoo now also lets people adopt animals for a fee. A biosphere learning center, canteen and a library are also present in the scenic campus. With battery operated vehicles making it easy to navigate inside the zoo, visitors can also choose to walk or get their private vehicle inside for a fee. While the zoo opened its doors to the public in 1977, the Zoo brigade was a much recent venture that started in March 2016. The entry fee for the event is Rs.50/- and those interested are invited to register their names with event organizers at the main gate of the zoo by June 3rd, 5:30PM. Participants will be limited to 50 persons, so those interested need to register soon. And for people who have more questions, don’t hesitate to call at these numbers and clear your doubts. A.
