There’s good news for tourists to Thailand from Visakhapatnam. Thailand’s Government has decided to extend the visa-on-arrival fee waiver until 31 October 2019. The waiver was introduced after noticing a dip in the incoming tourists from India, China, and Sri Lanka. Reportedly, this fee exemption has been made applicable to India and 20 other countries. Last year, Thailand run airlines, Air Asia had introduced low fare flights, four days a week, from Vizag to Bangkok. They now plan to increase tourists from Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Kakinada and Rajamahendravaram. Speaking to The Hindu, the Secretary of Tours and Travels Association of Andhra Pradesh said they expect a significant increase in the leisure tourists flying to Bangkok from Visakhapatnam. The travel from city to Bangkok takes three hours. As per the report, the Air Asia officials have informed that their A320 aircraft has an average seating capacity of 150-180 passengers and are looking to increase the capacity on their return flights. The martial arts, beach resorts, rainforests, water sports, Buddhist temples, and wildlife sanctuaries are some of the attractions that lure tourists from Visakhapatnam to Bangkok, Phuket and Pattaya in Thailand.
