In the early hours of Wednesday, 22 May 2024, the Janmabhoomi Express traveling from Visakhapatnam to Lingampally faced an unexpected issue when two of its AC coaches got delinked. As a result, the train had to be brought back to Visakhapatnam railway station. Reportedly, passengers were left waiting at the station for over three hours, since the scheduled departure time of 6:20 am, as the railway personnel rectified the problem. The technical issue was recognised shortly after the train departed from the Visakhapatnam railway station and covered some distance in its journey towards Vijayawada. The railway station personnel notified the railway locomotive pilot about the delinked coaches, and the train was brought back. The coaches were later replaced, and the train was on its way again.
