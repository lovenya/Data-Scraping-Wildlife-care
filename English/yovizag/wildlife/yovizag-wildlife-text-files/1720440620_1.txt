The Indira Gandhi Zoological Park in Visakhapatnam was gifted three chimpanzees by the Israel National Parks Association. Reportedly, hundreds of visitors lined up for nearly an hour, waiting to welcome the cute chimps that were to be released into their enclosure. Children had fun watching the chimps pull at the bananas hanging from branches and gulping apple slices. HRD Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao inaugurated the new chimpanzee enclosure at the zoo and participated in the 62nd Wildlife Week celebrations. He asked the zoo officials to visit the Singapore Zoo and learn about night safari management, so the same can be implemented here to improve revenue. He asked the forest officials to prepare proposals for a night safari. Animals lovers were urged to adopt animals and Public Sectors urged to dedicate their CSR funds for the development of the zoo. Doing so will reduce the burden on the zoo administration, lessening the expense of Rs 5 crore they need to take proper care of the animals and maintain the zoo. The tickets only manage to generate Rs 2 crore. Spread over 620 acres, the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park is the largest zoo in the state. Ganta Srinivasa Rao has stated that orders will be issued to all schools soon to take their students to visit the zoo atleast once a year to create awareness about wildlife and indirectly, also help improve the revenue of the zoo.
