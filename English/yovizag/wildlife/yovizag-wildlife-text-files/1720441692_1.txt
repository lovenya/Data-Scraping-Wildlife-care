On Saturday, 18 November 2023, the Visakhapatnam division of the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department launched the Eastern Ghats Biodiversity Centre (EGBC) near PM Palem, which houses an Orchidarium, Ficatarium, and other attractions. Spread across 30 acres, the EGBC, an eco-tourism spot, aims to highlight the diverse range of floral species the region houses. Speaking at the inauguration of the Eastern Ghats Biodiversity Centre, Y Madhusudhana Reddy, Chief Wildlife Warden of Andhra Pradesh, expressed, “This centre will provide a great opportunity for the public of Visakhapatnam to learn and rejuvenate amidst green surroundings.” This facility houses three parks- Aushadha Vanam, Karthik Vanam, and Rashi Vanam- alongside a forest produce processing unit. The processing unit will employ tribal women to make eco-friendly plant ports from elephant and cow dung as well as products from forests for public consumption. A Bambusetum with 25 bamboo species and a cafe-cum-library with the theme of nature conversation are under the pipeline.
