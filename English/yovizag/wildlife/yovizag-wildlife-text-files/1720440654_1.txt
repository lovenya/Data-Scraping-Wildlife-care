The Kambalakonda Reserve Forest is soon going to have a slew of adventure activities to bring in more visitors and tourists. The Forest Department officials stated that a master plan is prepared for development to turn the reserve into an eco-tourism park. A biodiversity survey has also been done to chart out new routes through the forest for patrolling and safari. The Kambalakonda Forest Reserve is on 71 square kilometres of hilly terrains with steep slopes. It is situated off the NH 20 KMS away from Visakhapatnam. The Andhra Pradesh Forest Department mans the forest that is being redeveloped now with a fund of Rs 12 crore sent in by the World Bank. The fund was provided as part of the Andhra Pradesh Disaster Recovery Project. Hudhud had destroyed the amenities at the reserve. The master plan that has now been prepared consists of adventure activities. The activities will be around the river and include river rope swing, flying fox and boating. Camping sites are also being planned and trek routes are in place. The canteen is being renovated and the rest will commence within the month. A route will pass through the park into the interiors of the forest. Earlier, one had to go all around the forest to reach either end. The new route will help out with patrolling and even a safari. Camera traps during the biodiversity survey conducted with the help of wildlife experts revealed the presence of wildlife. Sambar and mouse deer, wild dogs and boars, porcupine, palm civets and rusty spotted cats were found to be dwelling here. The pug marks of leopards were found too. Kambalakonda also plays host to a huge variety of flora and fauna. A survey is now being done on the flora and smaller fauna like reptiles, amphibians and butterflies.
