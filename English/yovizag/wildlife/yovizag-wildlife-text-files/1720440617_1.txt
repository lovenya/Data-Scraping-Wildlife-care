Salman Khan was acquitted by the Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur for the Black Buck and Chinkara poaching cases.  This incident took place during September 1998 while he was shooting for his film Hum Saath Saath Hain. The case was filed against him under Section 51 of Wildlife Protection Act for poaching two Chinkaras on 26-27 September and one Chinkara on 28-29 September. He was convicted and sentenced to one and five years of jail term in 2006. After spending a week’s time at Jodhpur jail, he was bailed. After that he challenged the lower court and went to the High Court. The High Court heard the cases in the month of May but gave the verdict today.  They said that there wasn’t any evidence to prove that the antelopes/Chinkara was shot from Mr. Khan’s “licensed” gun. The jeep that the actor was riding has gone missing. The actor was also acquitted last year for his 13 year old hit and run case but the Maharashtra government have challenged the verdict. The actor was last in news for his controversial comment on rape.
