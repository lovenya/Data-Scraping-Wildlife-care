The State Forest Department in association with NGO Trendsetters is bringing International Tiger day celebration to Vizag. They are organizing ‘Tiger Trek’ on July 29th, a nature walk in the core area of Kambalakonda. This a first in Vizag. Participants will be imparted information about: Aim of the trek – Creating awareness for the conservation of our national animal, the tiger whose numbers are fast depleting. Vizag located in the Eastern Ghats is home to leopards and some bigger members of the cat family. Even though tigers have not been sighted recently, they were spotted in the Chintapalli agency areas a few decades ago. Across the world there are lesser than 4000 tigers. Why Kambalakonda? Though there are no existing tiger numbers recorded here, leopards are known to exist. A new trekking path is the road map for the proposed trek. This goes through the Kambalakonda Reserve Forest area towards Sambuvanipalem village. Forest officials and guards will accompany the trekkers. Highlighting the methods of study and findings of the census will be the core aim. Live demonstrations of camera traps will be shown. No better place for Tiger Trek this International Tiger Day.
