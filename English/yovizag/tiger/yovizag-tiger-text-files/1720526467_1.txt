In what might prove to be a major attraction to the tourists in the state, it has been announced that three Tiger Safari Parks have been proposed in Andhra Pradesh. Reportedly, The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) in Andhra Pradesh, P Mallikarjuna Rao said that the safaris would be coming up in Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, and Rajahmundry. The Tiger Safari Parks are expected to conserve the Tiger population in the state and help the places develop as tourist spots in the country. Mr. Rao, while inspecting forest nurseries and works in Srikakulam on Wednesday, said that a marine park would soon be established in Visakhapatnam near Sagar Nagar on 36 acres. He further added that the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park in the city would be modernised as a part of the drive. While the marine park would be set up to conserve marine resources, eco-tourism parks too have proposed at 15 temples across the state to improve the greenery in the state. “As part of Vanam-Manam, we are planning to sow 27 crore saplings in the ensuing rainy season with cooperation of all other departments and geo-tagging would be done for their protection”, the PCCF was quoted as saying. The PCCF also spoke on the issue of the elephant menace in Srikakulam and the bordering areas in Odisha. Mr Rao informed that the officials were conducting a detailed study of the elephant issues in other countries and were used drones and other technologies to track their movement.
