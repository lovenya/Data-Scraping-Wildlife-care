During the winter, the state comes alive with colourful festivals, music events, and beach parties that attract tourists from around the world. Here are some of the best tourist places to visit in Goa. Located in North Goa and surrounded by Anjuna and Calangute beaches, Baga Beach is a water sports hub.

Popular with tourists, especially in the evenings, this location is renowned for its breathtaking views and sunset vistas.
