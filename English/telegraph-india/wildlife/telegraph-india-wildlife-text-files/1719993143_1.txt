Shillong: The National Green Tribunal will soon decide whether to declare 5km from the edges of rivers, reserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries "regulated zones". The "green court" has taken up a case moved by Sajay Laloo from Meghalaya, (in original application number 73 of 2014), seeking directionsto the state of Meghalaya to frame a policy to protect rivers and carve out regulated zones along the banks of major rivers, wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests and natural caves in Meghalaya. Laloo had earlier made a prayer before the tribunal to declare 5km from the edges of all major rivers, water bodies, wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests and natural caves as regulated zones where no industrial or mining activities shall be allowed. In a statement issued here on Wednesday, Laloo said the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change on Tuesday had informed the tribunal that a plan - for restoration of environment and ecology, particularly protection of water bodies from unscientific and unregulated coal mining - had been prepared and which was also filed in an affidavit on October 3 last year. "The tribunal has granted liberty to file replies to the application within two weeks from January 2. Advance copies of replies should be furnished to the applicant who may file rejoinder(s), if any, within one week," Laloo said.
