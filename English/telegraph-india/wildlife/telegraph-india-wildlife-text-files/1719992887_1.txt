Jamshedpur, April 15: Visiting the birthplace of her famous husband, British author and animal conservationist Gerald Durrell over two decades after his death in 1995, Lee Durrell, 67, today evinced eagerness to forge ties with Tata zoo, Jamshedpur forest authorities and schools. The lady, who runs the wildlife park her husband had set up at Channel Island of Jersey, United Kingdom, visited Tata Steel zoo, which happens to be India's first privately run one, this afternoon. Interacting with the media later in the evening at Centre For Excellence, Lee said there was room for improvement at Tata zoo but did not elaborate. "There is always room for improvement. I will be writing about it to zoo authorities. We would welcome collaboration with authorities for better animal care," said Lee, in her capacity as director of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. An ideal zoo is where authorities consider it their bounden duty to provide animals with the best possible upkeep, look at ways for conservation and educate the masses to love animals, said Lee who studied animal behaviour in Duke University. Lee also visited house No. 10, Beldih Lake, Northern Town, where Gerald was born on January 7, 1925. His father Lawrence Samuel Durrell, a contractor who built Tata Steel general office, Tata Main Hospital, Tinplate Company and many bungalows in Jamshedpur, died in 1928 after which "Gerry" returned to England. Lee spoke about saving endangered species to Loyola School students this morning and launched the Durrell Corner (collection of books, videos and pictures of Gerald Durrell) on campus in the evening. She interacted with officials of Jamshedpur forest division on her late husband's vision. "The Durrell Foundation and Durrell Conservation Academy would like to help students know more about conservation. We'd like to invite forest officials to apply for courses on animal conservation and management of endangered species," Lee said.
