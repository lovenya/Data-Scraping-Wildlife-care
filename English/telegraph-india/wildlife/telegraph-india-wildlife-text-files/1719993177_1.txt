When it rains, it pours. First, the Union ministry of culture circulated a cabinet proposal seeking to amend the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, to permit 'public works' to be built within a 100-metre radius around protected archaeological monuments. The act in its present form prohibits this. A few days later, it was reported that the Union environment minister, Anil Madhav Dave, had instructed the experts on the ministry's appraisal committees to hurry up and clear pending projects. The news of these two events in quick succession is suggestive. The notion of 'development' in the government of the Bharatiya Janata Party does not seem to take too much account of environmental and heritage conservation. Environmental safeguards have never been very strong in India, or diligently used. The present Union government has further weakened them by, for example, allowing industry to creep closer to national parks. The Environmental Impact Assessment Resource and Response Centre also alleged that the National Board for Wildlife panel cleared projects without conducting site inspections, and approved projects that were rejected by previous committees. Mr Dave, too, seems in a hurry - he reportedly asked non-official members of appraisal committees to work towards the "goal" or "resign". In some cases, heritage conservation is used as a pretext by vested interests, as are environmental issues. Some people profit from environmental activism. But such cases can be weeded out. What is worrying is that the government is telling experts what to do, when the laws are crystal clear with regard to conservation, protection, and the distinct roles of the government and expert panels on the subject of recommending clearances. The proposed amendment would also enfeeble the National Monuments Authority, which reviews the government's requests for construction within 200 metres around monuments. These cannot be good omens for conservation in this country.
