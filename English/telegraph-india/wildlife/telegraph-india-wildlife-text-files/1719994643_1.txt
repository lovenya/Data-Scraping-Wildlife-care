A number of social organisations in Siliguri have launched drives to prevent the use of banned crackers during Diwali. Led by the Himalayan Nature & Adventure Foundation (HNAF), a prominent organisation that has been working for conservation of nature and wildlife and also in adventure sports, some associations organised an awareness rally here on Friday. Others like SwitchON Foundation and Suryanagar Samaj Kalyan Sanstha have lined up similar events. Animesh Bose, the programme coordinator of HNAF, said they held the rally for a noise-free Diwali from Kanchenjunga Stadium to Mahatma Gandhi More. “Tomorrow, we will announce a helpline number where any resident can inform us if banned crackers are used in his locality. We will pass on the information to concerned authorities immediately,” said Bose. The SwitchON Foundation, an environment conservation society based in Calcutta, has been working for a “smoke-free Diwali” in Siliguri and other parts of the state. Over the past few days, they have organised meetings where representatives of different NGOs, urban local bodies, educators, volunteers and government officials were present. “Discussions were held on air pollution and how the use of crackers increases the levels,” said Sandipan Sarkar, a convener of the foundation.
