Birds' Buddy - a group of wildlife enthusiasts in Hazaribagh - is hosting a nearly two-week-long photography competition in town from Wednesday. Entries are being accepted in three categories via email. The theme for Group I is landscape and the category is open to students of Classes VII to IX. In Group II, students of Classes X to XII can submit their click on street life. The third category is open to all and has multiple themes, ranging from wildlife to the heritage of Jharkhand. Wildlife buff Shib Shankar Goswami, who runs Birds' Buddy, said prizes would be given away on August 19 to mark World Photography Day. "I believe the competition is serving the dual purpose of spreading awareness about photography as well as about the rich and diverse flora and fauna of Jharkhand," he said. Goswami said interested candidates could send their pictures in high-resolution format to birdsbuddyhzb@gmail.com till August 13. The size of images should be between 50KB and 2MB. They can also call with queries at 9905338821 and 9534111127. "A panel of four judges will decide the winners. Their decision will be final. Prizes (cash or kind, yet to be decided) and certificates will be given away at the community hall of Forest Colony," Goswami added.
