Agartala, Aug. 27: The Tripura government has  decided to notify a part of  Trishna wildlife sanctuary, under Belonia subdivision of South Tripura, as a national park for bisons. Wildlife warden B. K. Singdeo said of a total area of 82 square km at Trishna, 32 square km would be earmarked as the national park. During the past few years, shrinking pastureland  within the sanctuary, vagaries of nature and incursions  by bisons into neighbouring Bangladesh have led to  their number dwindling rapidly. Recently, three bisons that had strayed into Bangladesh territory in search of green grass never returned. “As against 300 bisons in 2002, we currently have only 100, according to the latest survey conducted by the wildlife wing of forest department,” said Singdeo. Officials in the wildlife wing of the forest department have prepared a detailed proposal for the project. It will be submitted to National Zoo Authority (NZA) for approval and actual notification. “This is being done to facilitate the flow of funds for building infrastructure within the sanctuary so that the bison population can survive and grow here,” said Singdeo. Apart from this, two watchtowers will be built to enable tourists to have a glimpse of the endangered species. The bisons do not like human presence in close proximity. Besides, the possibilities of eco-tourism are also being explored at Trishna,  located in a desolate corner in the southwestern part of the state. In 2005, the NZA had   a part of the Sipahijala wildlife sanctuary as a national park for preservation and protection of the clouded leopard, a rare species in this part of the country. Sipahijala has been  notified as the best breeding ground for this species. Singdeo said that once  the NZA accepted the  proposal, Trishna wildlife sanctuary would also emerge as a centre for the nurture and protection of the bison population.
