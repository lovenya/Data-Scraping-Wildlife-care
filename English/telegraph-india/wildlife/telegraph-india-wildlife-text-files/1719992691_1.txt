Kendrapara: The Bhitarkanika National Park authorities have initiated measures to ensure the safety of wild animals from the prevailing heatwave. Steps have been taken to keep intact the natural sources of water for the wildlife ensconced along the forest division. "Availability of water for the animals is the major area of concern for us. The forest department is prepared with adequate measures, so that animals are not found wanting in water intake," said a forest official. New water holes have been carved out to cater to the animals' need. The water holes are connected to natural sources of water from creeks and water inlets. In case the existing water sources dry up, the newly created water bodies would compensate the daily water intake of the animals, said another official. "The sanctuary has rich reserve of water sources. So, animals have not yet experienced any water shortage. Still, we have created new water sources to meet with the exigencies," said Rajnagar mangrove (wildlife) divisional forest officer Bimal Prasanna Acharya. The deer species and wild boar are averse to saline water that is in abundance in these mangrove-rich areas of Bhitarkanika. Fresh water sources within the habitation corridors of animals often get dried up in some patches during the peak summer months. But, the water sources are available in abundance. The department had dug up more than 25 new fresh water ponds in the specific mangrove-infested pockets. Despite officials' claim of readiness, reports of animals straying into human habitation areas in search of water are pouring in from the forest-side villages. As a result, it is triggering man-animal conflict in various parts.
