Jamshedpur: An 18-month-old elephant calf died accidentally during a fierce fight between two adult tuskers inside Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary. A tusk of an adult elephant impaled the male calf who was standing too close to the fighting duo. The tragic accident occurred late on Tuesday night, inside the elephant sanctuary's Ghusijharna jungles near Konkadasa village, some 45km from Jamshedpur. Though villagers informed foresters on Wednesday, a team returned from the spot as elephants were huddled around the carcass. On Thursday afternoon, as the herd had moved on, foresters completed formalities such as post-mortem of the calf and its burial. Two government vets R.K. Singh and Surender Kumar Singh performed the post-mortem to ascertain that a tusk had pierced deep into the calf's abdomen leading to its death. The body also bore bruises and cut marks. Dalma range officer R.P. Singh, who went with the vets to Ghusijharna jungles, said the adult tuskers could have been engaged in a turf battle when the calf came too close.
