Ranchi, Nov. 10: A rise in temperature in Ladakh by just one degree, that too in the next 50 years, can shrink glaciers to less than one-fifth of their present size. Indications were available when Zaskar River melted before schedule, stranding 95 people, who had to wait for three months to return to the passes. This was the warning issued in A Degree of Concern, a short film by Syed Fayaz that was screened on the opening day of Ranchi CMS Vatavaran-2008 — a three-day reel festival on wildlife and environment — at the local Forest Auditorium. The festival, organised by the Centre of Media Studies (CMS) in association with  Manthan Yuva Sansthan, is being supported by a number of other organisations besides forest departments of the state and the Centre. The biennial festival is being held in seven more cities — Agartala, Bhopal, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Leh, Lucknow and Pune. Another film, Water War by Nutan Manmohan, was also screened today. It is a take on the Indus water treaty between India and Pakistan. Of the other films that earned rave reviews were Senani Hegde’s Wild Dog Diaries, a chilling tale of the mysterious predator of the Nilgiris. With both its habitat and prey base shrinking, the majestic king of the jungle was the subject of Krishnendu Bose’s Tiger: The Death Chronicles. An inconvenient truth by Davis Guggenhelm presented the details of how former US Vice-President Al Gore fought against global warming by exposing the myths and misconceptions surrounding it. “We never knew that the problem was of such great magnitude,” said Vishal, one of the many students who saw A Degree of Concern. Heeda, who came to Ranchi from the Netherlands, felt the films were the best way of creating awareness among the people. As many 25 films were screened on the opening day of the festival. A workshop on green films and a seminar on climate change also marked the occasion.
