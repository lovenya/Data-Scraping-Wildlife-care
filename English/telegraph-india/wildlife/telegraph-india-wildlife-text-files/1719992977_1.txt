Footfall to the scenic Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary has nosedived, ironically, due to an elephantine problem. Maverick Don, the 50-plus elephant with a broken tusk, known for his mood swings, is acting as a deterrent. Of late, he has been spotted hovering around a temple near Pinderbera Guest House, where visitors shack up to spot wildlife, especially elephants who come to nearby watering holes in the evenings. The 192sqkm Dalma sanctuary is home to around 150-odd elephants. There is a rush of visitors around this time because elephants amble back to the sanctuary after their annual sojourn to jungles of Bankura and West Midnapore, Bengal. "Over 100 guests used to come everyday to watch elephants quench their thirst in May last week. While some stayed on at the guest house, others left by the evening. But now, visitors seem to be avoiding the sanctuary," said Dalma range officer Mangal Kachhap. Dalma guard Kaleshwar Bhagat said Don had taken a special liking for a Shiva temple, around 4km from Pinderbera. "The elephant stays anchored at the temple's entrance most of the time and savours jackfruits. The priests are terrified. The only time he leaves is when he goes to Nichla Bandh to take a dip in the water. Then, he is back again and stays till late evening," he said. Earlier, Don used to stand in the middle of the road leading towards the guest house. Forest officials have started taking an undertaking from visitors saying they were visiting the sanctuary on their own accord and that the state would not be liable for any personal injury or damage to property. "We started taking these written undertakings from June 2 from visitors, especially bikers, as Don could be anywhere on the road near Satbharia, about 2km from Pinderbera," Kachhap said.
