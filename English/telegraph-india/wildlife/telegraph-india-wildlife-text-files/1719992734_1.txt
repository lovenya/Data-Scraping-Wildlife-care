Jalpaiguri, June 22: A series of pictures posted on the Facebook profile page of a forest range officer's daughter with a leopard cub drew criticisms by wildlife activists. This evening, Binni Sikdar, the daughter of Samir Sikdar, a range officer in Malbazar, deleted the photos and sought an apology for the posts. On June 10, Sikdar had rescued the cub from Kathambari forest. "I brought it home and kept it for a day as there is no infrastructure at the range office. The same day, my daughter, who studies in a Siliguri college, came home. She loves animals. She picked up the cub and took some pictures with it without my notice," he said. Sumita Ghatak, divisional forest officer, Gorumara wildlife division, said: "It was incorrect that his daughter took such photos with the cub. I will talk to the ranger tomorrow." Animesh Bose, programme co-ordinator, of Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation said: "It was inappropriate to take such pictures."
