Ten Himalayan griffon vultures that had recovered from poisoning in Laokhowa wildlife sanctuary in Assam's Nagaon district last month were released in their home range by the forest authority of the sanctuary in the presence of a team of Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) of the International Fund for Animal Welfare-Wildlife Trust of India on Thursday. Fourteen of 26 Himalayan griffons were found dead inside the sanctuary on March 25. Of the rescued 12, two had died on the way but the rest had been saved by the CWRC team that had taken care of the birds. The vultures had become sick owing to secondary carcass poisoning inside the protected area by miscreants. Text by a staff reporter, picture by UB Photos
