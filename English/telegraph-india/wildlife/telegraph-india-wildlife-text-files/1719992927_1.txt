Jamshedpur schoolgirls can now easily identify a red-vented bulbul or a parakeet, thanks to Tata zoo that had organised a day's bird-watching tour to Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary on Sunday. The trip was a part of the zoo's four-day Nature Camp that had kicked off on May 8. Sabah Alam, divisional forest officer of Dhalbhum, had inaugurated the camp, which will conclude on Monday. "Today was the best day, as we saw beautiful avian species and learnt the art of bird-watching at Dalma. We now know the red-vented bulbul and the parakeet. However, the breathtaking moment was when a herd of seven elephants, including two calves, crossed our path. We all kept quiet and witnessed wildlife at its best," said Shail Maheshwari, a Class X student of DBMS English School. Like Shail, 40 other students from Classes VII to X of four schools - DBMS English School, Chinmaya Vidyalaya, South Park, SDSM School of Excellence and Rajkiya Madhya Vidyalaya, Sundernagar - are learning new things about nature and ways to conserve it at the ninth edition of the camp that is supported by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change. For an outdoor exposure programme, the students will visit Indian Council for Agriculture and Research in Ranchi on Monday where they will take a tour of the facility to learn about agricultural and horticultural initiatives and innovations.
