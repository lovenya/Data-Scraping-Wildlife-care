Shillong, Feb. 22: BSF troops in Meghalaya's South Garo Hills district today seized 15 rare loggerhead turtles, which are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The troops noticed suspicious movement of two persons on a motorcycle while the duo# were proceeding from Baghmara to Gasuapara this morning. "When the BSF troops on duty tried to stop them, they didn't halt, but fled after dropping a bag," a BSF official said. Around 15 rare species of turtles were recovered from the bag, the official said. However, the duo managed to escape. "These turtles are being smuggled from India to Bangladesh. It is a significant effort by the BSF as these rare loggerhead turtles are protected under Schedule I and IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972," the official said. The official said the turtles are extremely expensive and are in high demand in the international market as they have medicinal values.
