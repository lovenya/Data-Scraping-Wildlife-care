Dhemaji: Divisional forest officer of Daying Ering wildlife sanctuary Tasang Taga said no illegal hunting and fishing activities will be tolerated in and around the park. In view of the three-day Unying-Aaran festival, which will begin on March 7, the administration has issued a strict order, banning all illegal activities and has also sought cooperation to protect the flora and fauna. "I understand the religious and cultural importance of Unying-Aaran, the hunting festival of our Adis, but I can't tolerate any illegal activities in and around the park," said Taga, a trained wildlife expert from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. Unying-Aaran, also known as the hunting festival of the Adi community, is the first gala event of the Adi New Year. It is also one of the oldest festivals of the community that celebrates the arrival of spring. The villagers perform Bari songs and Yakjong dance. The festival is celebrated after the return of the hunting troupes, comprising male villagers, from the jungles. Taga, who took charge recently, appealed to everyone not to trespass into the park areas. He said the department would initiate serious action against the law violators. East Siang deputy commissioner Tamiyo Tatak had on February 19 banned illegal hunting and fishing in the district. Taga also issued a similar order on February 27. The sanctuary has been witnessing illegal hunting and fishing for the past three years because of poor vigilance by the park authorities. The sightings of salt lick ambush and killing of wild animals were reported this week. Sibiyamukh range forest officer Damek Koyu said his team has already started patrolling and also met the chief of Namsing village for cooperation.
