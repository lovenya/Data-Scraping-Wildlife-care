Kokrajhar, Sept. 25: The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), in association with the Assam forest department and the Central Institute of Technology in Kokrajhar, conducted an animal action education workshop among schoolteachers from the fringe villages of greater Manas. This was done with the objective to spread awareness about keynote species existing in the forest habitat of greater Manas landscape in the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) among schoolchildren. Altogether 37 teachers attended the workshop, which was supported by the elementary education department, BTC. "Children from Classes I to IX were targeted through the teachers, who play a crucial role in spreading the message of wildlife conservation among schoolchildren," said Subhamoy Bhattacharjee, assistant manager, awareness for conservation, WTI. He said, "Children are the future of a nation and if love for wildlife can be inculcated in them at an early stage they grow up to be responsible citizens who will in the future protect the natural heritage of India." "People living around Manas National Park have historically had a close association with Asian elephants and this year's workshop theme on elephant conservation was greatly appreciated by the teachers," he said. The film Elephants Never Forget was shown to the teachers for their better understanding of this species. Teachers' role in wildlife conservation and issues related to conservation from planting a sapling to ivory smuggling was discussed.
