Paradip, Jan. 15: The Paradip beach has turned into a graveyard of Olive Ridley turtles just at the onset of their mating season. Carcasses of these endangered marine animals were doting the two-kilometre coastline from lighthouse to Mahanadi confluence point. The incident has worried even forest officials as animal carcasses are being washed ashore every now and then before arribada, the egg-laying period of the species. Rajnagar Mangrove divisional forest officer Bimal Prasanna Acharya said: "We are initiating immediate measures to check the death of these endangered animals." The carcasses spotted at the tourist spots are being buried, while at some place carcasses are left to decay in the open, said a forest official. The forest officials are trying to ascertain the exact cause of the death of the turtles en masse. However, it is suspected that these turtles are dying after getting entangled in the nets of the fishing trawls or being hit by their propellers.Patrolling has been intensified along the coast to check illegal fishing in turtles' habitation zones. So far, 26 fishing trawls have been confiscated and 152 crews arrested. A wildlife activist blamed the fishing trawlers for the turtle deaths. "When the turtles get entangled in the fishing nets, the fishermen hit them with hammers to kill them in order to save their nylon fishing net. They throw the carcass of the turtles into the sea and which are then washed ashore," he said. At present, the beach wears a ghastly look with stray dogs feasting on the bloated and decomposed carcasses of Ridley turtles.#
