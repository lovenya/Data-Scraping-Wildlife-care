Guwahati: The Amchang Abhyaranya Datikakharia Sthai Janagusthio Bhumi Sangrakhyan Surakha Samity, an organisation representing villagers near Amchang wildlife sanctuary, and the Guwahati Unnayan Samiti, on Tuesday demanded rollback of the declaration of Amchang as an eco-sensitive zone and distribution of land to 85,000 landless families here. Speakers slammed the state government's eviction from a revenue village. They warned the state government to desist from such steps without completing the land survey under way in the area. The state government had carried out an eviction drive against encroachers in two phases, in August and November last year. The eviction was suspended following massive protests and a court order. Jayanta Phangcho of the villagers' group said, "The Government of India, through a draft notification on May 7, 2017, declared Amchang wildlife sanctuary and nearby areas an eco-sensitive zone. The government was earlier directed to notify the villagers in the area and seek recommendations from them but nothing was done. The boundary of Amchang is not clearly demarcated and the government should complete the survey before taking any steps." Environmentalist and former principal of B. Borooah College, Biren Baishya, said, "We don't want greenery to vanish but such eco-sensitive zones should be declared with support of villagers. Conservation efforts will not succeed without their cooperation." Another speaker demanded that the 85,000 landless families of Guwahati, who paid revenue during Congress rule, should be allotted land. A white paper on the recommendations of Hari Shankar Brahma Committee was sought to protect indigenous land rights.
