G.B. THAPLIYAL, principal chief conservator of forests, met readers of The Telegraph at his office in  Aranya Bhavan on Wednesday to answer their queries. Participants included Sourish Mishra, Jayanta Sthanapati, Animesh Das, G. Laha, Sandip Banerjee, J.N. Das and Abhirup Biswas Animesh Das: What is the extent of the forest area in the state? Has it decreased? The forest area in the state has increased by 13.38 per cent over the last couple of years. At present, there is 11,879 sq km of forest land in the state. This includes sanctuaries in both south and north Bengal. Most of the forest areas are in north Bengal. In south Bengal, only the Sunderbans has been declared a forest land. Animesh Das: There are allegations that forest officials exaggerate the size of the forests. How do you estimate the size of a forest? What is the legal definition of forest land? Three agencies in the country conduct surveys at national and regional levels to assess the forest area. We compare the results and interpretations and decide on the total amount of forest land. Forest Survey of India, Geographical Information System (GIS) and INSAT satellite systems are the three agencies that provide us with the data. It takes experts to interpret the data obtained from GIS and INSAT systems, since only clusters of colours are shown in satellite pictures. The actual amount of forest land is calculated by analysing the colours on the data sheet. Technically, areas where plantations have grown naturally are considered forest land. It must be kept in mind that groups of trees should cover at least a hectare for the area to be considered a forest land. J.N. Das: The term conservation is often associated with forest and wildlife. What does it mean? You have asked an interesting question. As I just said, forest areas are those where the trees have grown without artificial care. If such land is left alone, they will be encroached for housing, agriculture and for illegal tree-felling. Thus, it is very important for us to protect the forest lands from invaders. To our department, conservation means judicious use of forest land, preservation of their form and, if possible, increasing the greenery and expanse of forest lands. All this comes under the purview of forest conservation. Though we permit licensed traders to cut down trees in the forest areas, we ensure that such activities do not hamper the biotic balance. Abhirup Biswas: What are the different wings of the forest  department? We have three units under the forest department. The first is the conservation section. There is also a full-fledged division to supervise wildlife in forests, sanctuaries and reserves. We even have an urban and recreational forestry department to look after the greenery in non-forest, city and suburban areas. The last wing mainly works for the promotion of greenery in the city. Though we are the apex authority of forest land, the conservation and protection of wild animals is mostly looked after by the wildlife section. They also carry out a survey and census of animals within the forest areas. Jayanta Sthanapati: The slogan for this year?s environment campaign focuses on greenery in the city. Has your department taken up a masterplan in this regard? The urban and recreational forestry wing has chalked out an elaborate plan to add to the city greenery. As per the plan, we will plant nearly 100,000 saplings in the city and adjoining areas this year and help to maintain them. We         have tied up with schools and            non-government organisations to distribute the workload of plantation. We are trying to plant a large number of trees through school students. The saplings will be provided free. We have also adopted a system to estimate the chances of survival of the saplings. To be continued
