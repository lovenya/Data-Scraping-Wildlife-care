Daniel, sporting a pony-tail,                       hopes to make it big as a session guitar player one day.                       This despite the absence of a western music culture in his                       hometown, Nagpur. He has already bagged a project with an                       American company for a guitar instruction video. Neil runs                       an NGO for handicapped children in Pune. Dorothy from Visakhapatnam                       is pursuing medicine. Although from diverse regions across                       the country, the Anglo-Indian youth who took part in a panel                       discussion at La Martiniere for Girls on October 21 had                       one thing in common. They all are dreaming bigger than their                       forebears. The talk “We are a part of the                       new dawn of the new India” saw the youngsters address issues                       of identity, migration and language, as citizens of India                       and as members of an ethnic community. The session, chaired                       by Barry O’Brien, was part of the three-day annual general                       meeting of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association and The                       All-India Anglo-Indian Education Institution held in the                       city after 44 years. The young panel, dressed in faded                       jeans, formal suits, skirts and churidars, was out to quash                       the myth that Anglo-Indians were isolated from the mainstream.                       Marianne from Calcutta is a fashion designer, while Dominic                       from Jamshedpur gives lessons in basketball at a convent                       school in Calcutta. Dominic spoke of the need to extend                       help to other members of the community who wish to join                       the same profession. The views were a mix of traditional                       and modern on marriage. Marrying within the community was                       the need of the hour since it was diminishing, said Sheena                       from Pune. For Neil, it did not matter which community a                       person belonged to as long as both were willing to adjust,                       but Maureen from Bangalore was quite definite that she would                       prefer an Anglo-Indian to someone outside the community. Speaking the local language is                       not a problem for most, though Tracey from Pune remarked                       that it was equally important not to take the English language                       for granted. “We must learn to use it as a weapon,” she                       said. Romila Saha Seven tips for US study The US Educational Foundation                       in India organised an interactive session on “Graduate business                       studies in the US” with Rafique Dossani, consulting professor,                       Stanford University, on October 12.

The quiz kicked off in the morning                       after last-minute revisions, tips and encouraging words                       from classmates of the participants. Teams from 41 schools                       went through the preliminary round when each was given 20                       questions to answer in 20 minutes. Twelve schools qualified                       for the next rounds conducted by actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty. The first six three-member teams                       out of the 12 went through three tough rounds before Calcutta                       Public School, St Xavier’s and St Thomas’ Girls qualified                       for the finals. Out of the remaining six, DPS Newtown, DPS                       Ruby Park and St Thomas’ Boys, Kidderpore, reached the finals. The grand finale was a nail-biting                       affair right from start. Huddled in small groups, the quizzards                       consulted with teammates in whispers and fervently prayed                       for easy questions. The rapid-fire round was the best of                       all. St Thomas’ Boys emerged the winner, followed by Calcutta                       Public School and DPS Ruby Park. A guest appearance by magician                       P.C. Sorcar (Jr) heightened the spirits at the show. The                       crowd enjoyed his tricks and his great sense of humour. The event ended with speeches                       by the chief guests followed by the prize distribution ceremony. Shradhanjali Bose, Prateek                       Lohia and Mahashweta Bose

Ten teams fought it out                       in the carrom competition while other students cheered them                       on enthusiastically.

Many of the entries in the craft                       competition like photo frames, flower vases and items of                       decoration were made using recycled and waste materials                       like cartons and used paper. A turtle made of nut shells                       won Rideep Sarkar and his mother the first prize.
