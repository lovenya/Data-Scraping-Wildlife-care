Siliguri, May 16: Two decomposed elephant carcasses were spotted in a remote area of Darjeeling district in the Mahananda wildlife sanctuary last week raising questions over the role of the forest department in conserving animals. This comes at a time when foresters have claimed that increased vigilance is one of the main reasons for the increase in elephant population as revealed by the latest census. Residents of Norbung busty, on the fringes of the sanctuary, had spotted the carcasses on Friday and informed the foresters in Sukna who visited the spot the next day. “The villagers had said they had seen two outsiders roaming in the area a few months back,” said a forester. They had also said that there were holes in the skulls of the animals. “While one of the carcasses, of which only the skeleton is left, seems to be around five-six months old, the other had some flesh left in it indicating that the animal had died about two months back,” a forester said. Wildlife NGOs alleged that there were no regular patrols. “It is surprising that foresters did not know that two elephants have died. This indicates fallacy and dereliction of duty and it is evident that they have hardly visited the area in the past six months,” Sujit Das, secretary of Odlabari Nature and Adventure Society, said. The carcasses were taken to Sukna today. “In case it is found that the elephants were shot, appropriate steps should be taken against the employees concerned,” Das said. S.B. Mondal, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) said the animals might have died a natural death. “The location is in one of the remotest areas and the employees cannot be blamed.”
