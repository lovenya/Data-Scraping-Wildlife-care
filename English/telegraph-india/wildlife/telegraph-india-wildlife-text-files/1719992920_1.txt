Hundreds of them were killed over the past few months. And the killers went scot-free. But on Wednesday afternoon, a perfect trap was laid. Officials of the wildlife wing under the state forest department, pretending to be              hungry commuters, of Nalban, on the East Calcutta        Wetlands, came across those who killed cormorants (pankouri) and pond herons (konch bok) from the waterbody and sold the meat. For Rs 15 per bird! ?We arrested five persons today. Two dead birds ? a cormorant and a pond heron ? were found on them and three cormorants, still alive but in bad shape, were rescued,? said an official. According to the deputy chief conservator (wildlife), V.K. Yadav, capturing, snaring, poisoning or killing these birds is a punishable offence. It applies to all Indian birds other than crow and common pigeon. Cormorants and pond herons are included in Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Penalty might mean imprisonment up to three years and/or fine up to Rs 25,000. ?We had received complaints from several nature enthusiasts that birds are being killed regularly in the East Calcutta Wetlands. Some had complained personally, and some had sent photographs via email. We had launched several operations in the past, but finally today, five persons were netted,? Yadav said. Rathin Banerjee, district forest officer, said hundreds of these birds might have been killed in the past few months. ?These birds are not rare, but if so many of them continue to be killed every day, they will become extinct in no time,? he said. Those who kill the birds use hooked fishing lines, with  fish as bait, to trap the birds. When the birds dive to grab the fish, the hooks get embedded in their throats. ?We suspect that even fishermen might be involved in the slaughter,? Yadav said. Banerjee added: ?Meat of these birds is a cheap alternative to chicken or mutton for small vendors who sell snacks on the roadside.? The dead birds have been sent for post-mortem, while the birds that were rescued have been taken to the Animal Rescue Centre in Salt Lake. They will be released later. ?We are jobless.We captured the birds for a meal,? claimed one of the arrested. They will be produced in court on Thursday.
