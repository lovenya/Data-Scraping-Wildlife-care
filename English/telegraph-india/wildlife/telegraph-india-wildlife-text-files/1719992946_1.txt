Madrid, July 21 (AP): The World Wildlife Fund’s branch in Spain has ousted King Juan Carlos as its honorary president after deciding his recent elephant hunting safari was incompatible with its goal of conserving endangered species. The fund said that “although such hunting is legal and regulated” it had “received many expressions of distress from its members and society in general”.
