Balasore, Dec. 3: The district veterinary cell plans to vaccinate the domestic livestock population here in view of anthrax scare following the death of a female elephant near Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary about two weeks ago. Veterinary experts feel that the elephant might have died of anthrax. The wildlife department has reportedly cremated the body with adequate care. Another jumbo, which was recently found sick in the sanctuary near Risia, is also believed to be suffering from the deadly disease. Divisional forest officer of Kuldiha Harsh Bardhan Udgata said that blood samples of the sick elephant had been sent to Bhubaneswar for further tests. Chief district veterinary officer Nityananda Das said, "The female pachyderm has perhaps died of anthrax. However, a report that can confirm its death due to the deadly bacteria is still awaited. In conducive condition, the dreaded bacteria can survive for up to 20 years." Elephants are more vulnerable to anthrax infection as they can smear anthrax-infected soil around their body while digging earth, said a wildlife expert. "Three teams have been formed to monitor the health of the sick tusker. Efforts are also on to check its diarrhoea," said another wildlife officer. Steps have also been initiated to vaccinate all the cattle population in and around Kuldiha. "We have started the vaccination process for all the livestock in 83 villages around the sanctuary," said chief district veterinary officer Das. Besides elephants, the sanctuary also houses leopards, bison and barking and spotted deer.
