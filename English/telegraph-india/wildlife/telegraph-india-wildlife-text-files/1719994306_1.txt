‘Tigris: The Queen of Wildlife’ by Maurizio Boscheri and Daniel Calovi was curated by Mario Liberali and organised by the consulate general of Italy in collaboration with the Kolkata Centre for Creativity. It was accompanied by a series of events, such as a painting exhibition and workshops with local artists and students, and a seminar on tiger conservation. The exhibition at the Kolkata Centre for Creativity was opened to the public on September 16 and will continue till September 24. The forthcoming workshops will include art students from renowned art colleges across the city who will join Maurizio and Daniel to paint a subject taking inspiration from the works of these two Italian artists. A seminar with experts on tiger conservation, open to the general public, will take place on September 23. “Seventeen oils and mixed media on canvas have been created, on gold or silver leaf backgrounds, through traditional painting methods as well as the application of semi-precious stones, and in all of them the protagonist is one: the Royal Bengal Tiger, the national animal of India. It is the first time the works by Maurizio and Daniel are exhibited in India, and with this show we also want to create awareness about wildlife conservation and environmental protection,” said Mario Liberali, curator.
