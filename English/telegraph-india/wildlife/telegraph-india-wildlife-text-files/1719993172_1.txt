About a dozen elephants ambled their way back to Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary last week after their annual sojourn to the jungles of Bengal. Veteran Dalma guard Kaleshwar Bhagat said the elephants were spotted near Mahajal on April 1. "Trackers have been deputed to keep a tab on their movement. They will subsequently slip into the core area of the sanctuary," he added. The elephants, including calves, were stationed on the fringes of the sprawling 192sqkm sanctuary and returned home via Bota, the largest jungle of the reserve. As many as 42 elephants were already back home. While 20, including three calves, returned to the reserve on February 1, 15 more joined them on March 6. Many are still anchored on the fringes and a few have gone back to Bengal. The elephants were expected to be back by the middle of March, but foresters said that abundance of food and water in Bengal, as well as in the fringe areas of the sanctuary, had delayed their return. "As the mercury mayhem has just begun, more elephants are expected to return in a week's time," said Dalma range officer Mangal Kachhap, adding that a fresh stock of firecrackers had been distributed among villagers who reside within the sanctuary. On the other hand, Don, the 50-year-old moody tusker of the sanctuary, had moved across towards Bengal last week and was yet to return to the reserve. "Don is no longer in the sanctuary. We know about his temperament. Hence, we are keeping tabs," said guard Bhagat.
