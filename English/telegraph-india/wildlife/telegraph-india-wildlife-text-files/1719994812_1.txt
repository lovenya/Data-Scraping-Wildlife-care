Air coolers, water jet sprays, bamboo sheds and stand fans are being deployed at the Bengal Safari Park on the outskirts of Siliguri to help the animals and birds beat the oppressive heat. Though there is no heatwave here, the mercury has been touching the 37-38°C mark during the daytime, inconveniencing the animals. “We have different species of animals, carnivores and herbivores at the park, along with a large number of birds. Due to the heat, we are taking all steps to keep them comfortable,” said an official posted at the park. Also known as North Bengal Wild Animal Park, it is the only open-air zoological park in the region. It is spread over 297 hectares off NH-10 on the fringes of the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary. Air-coolers and pedestal fans have been placed in the enclosures of Asiatic black bears. Water sprinklers and sprayers are used for animals such as the Royal Bengal Tiger and a pair of lions. “As of now, there are 14 tigers at the park, which include five newborn cubs. We are closely monitoring all these cubs and the health of their mother Shila. Three air-coolers and an equal number of stand fans have been placed for their comfort,” the official added. Last winter, a pair of lions was brought to the park from Tripura. “Similar arrangements have been made for the lions, which are still acclimatising to the new environment. They are yet to be released into an open enclosure for public display,” the official said. The park authorities have also brought some changes in the diets of the animals. The quantity of ORS supplied in animal enclosures has been increased. The protein content, on the other hand, has been reduced for lions and tigers. “Usually, 8-10kg of meat is provided to each adult lion and tiger. These days, the quantity has been reduced. Also, bamboo-made sheds have been put in different 
locations of the park, especially in the open-air aviary to keep the birds cool,” a source said.
