A leopard that strayed into a private school near Whitefield, on the eastern suburbs of Bangalore, on Sunday bites wildlife conservationist Sanjay Gubbi (top) on his left leg. The animal, which came from a nearby forest, was caught strolling inside the building of Vibgyor High School by security cameras around 4am. As only one watchman was on duty because of the weekend holiday, the leopard's presence was noticed much later when other guards arrived and scanned the camera footage. Residents and the security staff tried to drive out the animal but it hid in some thick bushes on an empty plot next to the school. But when some residents burst crackers and shouted, the leopard again scaled the school wall and entered the premises. It hid in a room near the swimming pool. When a team of forest and police officers, including conservationist Gubbi, arrived at the school, the animal leaped out of the room and pounced on him and Benna, a forest department driver. Gubbi (left) was rescued by others in the team and hospitalised. The leopard was tranquillised, caged and taken to Bannerghatta Biological Park, said Ravi Ralph, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife). Pictures by BangaloreNews Photos
