Elephants have started bidding adieu, albeit temporarily, to Dalma wildlife sanctuary as a part of their annual migration to neighbouring Bengal. A herd of over a dozen jumbos left for the jungles of West Midnapore and Bankura in Bengal late on Friday night. More herds  will also follow suit in the coming days. Unlike last year, elephants have started their journey to Bengal on time. Last year, the herds had started proceeding to the neighbouring state early, in May, wing to an encounter between CPI(Maoists) and paramilitary forces that disrupted their schedule. Wildlife experts say that elephants are super sensitive animals who love tranquil environs. Elephants usually migrate to Bengal in August-September and are back home in Januay-February. Depending upon their mood, jumbos often extend their stay in West Midnapore and Bankura. Dalma range officer (west) Dinesh Chandra said a herd of elephants left the sanctuary at 10pm on Friday.  “The migration to Bengal has started. More jumbos would catch the migratory route in batches,” he added. A forest guard said some of the migrating elephants were stationed near Dalbhumgarh in East Singhbhum, while some were in the fringe pockets of the 192 sq km sanctuary. “The jumbos should move to Bengal after a day or two. Herds normally stay at a place for food and water,” he said, adding some herds tend to extend their stay at a place. Another forest guard said the migratory corridor was full of vegetation, thanks to the recent spell of rains. “Food will not be an issue as the migratory route is full of vegetation,” he said.
