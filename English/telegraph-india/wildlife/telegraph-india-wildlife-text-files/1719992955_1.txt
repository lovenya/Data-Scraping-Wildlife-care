Siliguri, Oct. 18: The forest department will recruit 300 employees to strengthen the wildlife squads and intensify patrolling to prevent animals from straying into human habitats. “The new workers would be posted in different squads to prevent animals from straying into the fringe areas. The infrastructure of the existing squads will also be upgraded,” Sitanshubikas Mondal, the chief wildlife warden, told The Telegraph yesterday. He added that it was difficult for foresters to prevent animals from entering human habitat because of shortage of manpower and absence of necessary equipment. “The issues were discussed with the forest minister and I have submitted a report to him with requirements for upgrading the squads,” said Mondal. He said vehicles, tranquillising guns and searchlights would be given to the wildlife squads. “The department will require around Rs 2.5 crore every year for this.” The department now spends around Rs 50 lakh each year.
