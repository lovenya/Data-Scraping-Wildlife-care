Tourists visiting Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary can hope to feel the adrenaline pumping while going down the zip line later this year. A zip line consists of a pulley suspended on a cable made of stainless steel, mounted on a slope. It is designed to enable cargo or a person propelled by gravity to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding onto or being attached to the free moving pulley. The elephant abode 30km from Jamshedpur has been earmarked for the zip-line project under the Centre-funded Swadesh Darshan Scheme — aimed at integrated development of theme-based tourist circuits in the country and launched in 2014-15 — and things seem to be moving in the right direction. A team from the Centre has visited the sanctuary and gone through different slopes where zip line can be installed, it is reliably learnt. The team is also expected to visit again sometime this year before making a detailed project report. Dalma divisional forest officer (DFO) C.M.P. Sinha said the project was on track and they were hopeful of things falling in place later this year. “If zip line is not introduced this year it will surely be in place next year,” Sinha said. The sanctuary is a getaway for tourists from Jharkhand, Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh and the authorities hope the adventure sport will add to the attraction. “The project will certainly make a huge impact on the tourist footfall,” DFO Sinha said. Accommodation is not a problem at the sanctuary with at bamboo hut, air-conditioned cottages, non-AC rooms at Makulakocha as well as quarters at the entrance of Pinderbera forest guesthouse available for tourists.
