Hazaribagh, April 17: Water crisis has not only hit the human beings this summer. Dipping water-level has posed a serious threat to wild animals in Hazaribagh and Lawalong (Chatra) sanctuaries, too. A few days ago, stray dogs killed a deer that went out of the woods in search of water in Simeria of Chatra. Forest department officials? timely intervention saved another. Sources apprehend water crisis in sanctuaries would intensify further, especially in May, and animals would venture out of forest to quench their thirst. Thus, there could be a spurt in poaching. Though some steps are being taken to fight the situation in Hazaribagh sanctuary, nothing concrete has been done in Lawalong till date. Forest department officials of Hazaribagh division claimed they were digging small reservoirs at different points to fight the water crisis. Divisional forest officer (wildlife) Manish Arvind said he and his team members were working strategically to quench the thirst of animals in summer. ?The situation is alarming, but we will have to take steps to save the animals,? Arvind told The Telegraph. Arvind said they were also trying to clean the natural water bodies, especially ponds and small streams, inside the Hazaribagh sanctuary. ?After going through reports on villagers targeting thirsty animals, we have requested the residents of villages dotting the sanctuary to be kind to animals instead of killing them,? he said. ?Besides taking steps to fight water crisis, we have launched an awareness campaign against killing animals,? he added. However, sources said, no serious efforts were being made at Lawalong sanctuary to fight the water crisis. They said at least 150 more artificial water reservoirs were needed in the sanctuary. Though higher officials were informed about the alarming situation, so far no step had been taken, they added.
