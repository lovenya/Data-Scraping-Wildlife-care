Pangolin scales weighing over 3kg and 38 claws were seized from two men in an app cab on Bentinck Street by a joint team of the Calcutta police’s detective department (wildlife wing) and the wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB) on Saturday. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Chinese pangolin as a critically endangered species. Based on a tip-off, WCCB officials and officers from the detective department intercepted the cab. “It seems that multiple pangolins were hunted for quite some time and their claws and scales taken off,” said Agni Mitra, regional deputy director, WCCB. The two men — identified as Satish Kumar Chouhan, 37, and Basant Kumar Saw, 35 — were produced in a court that sent them to custody.
