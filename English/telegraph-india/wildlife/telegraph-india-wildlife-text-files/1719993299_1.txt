Jamshedpur, Feb. 25: After spending nearly six months in the jungles of Bengal, elephant herds have started ambling back to Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary. Eight elephants, including two calves, most of them from West Midnapore and Bankura, made their way to the sprawling 192-sq-km sanctuary in the wee hours of today. Foresters and trackers - village youths employed on daily wage to keep tabs on the movement of animals - have come across elephant dung near Bota - the largest jungle in the sanctuary. The jumbos are reported to have slipped into the core area of the reserve. Dalma range officer R.P. Singh said 8-10 elephants had arrived and the rest were expected to follow suit. "Some elephants have arrived at the sanctuary, but I am not sure whether others have left Bengal. But we are expecting the jumbos to be here soon as they have overstayed in West Midnapore and Bankura," he said. The authorities have directed villagers and trackers to keep a strict vigil on the migratory corridor. Dalma range office has also distributed crackers to villages in the sanctuary. According to a tracker, the home-bound have elephants reached Dalma via Dalbhumgarh in East Singhbhum. About 152 elephants, including tuskers and calves, had migrated to Bengal from Dalma during August-September last year. The elephants usually leave Bengal in December and are back home by the first week of February. Twenty eight jumbos, including four calves, had left Bengal in December and were spotted at Katagoda jungles near Patamda in East Singhbhum, fuelling hopes that the elephants would be home early this year. Tourists will be able to watch the elephants at Badka Bandh, Majla Bandh and Neechla Bandh - the favouite jaunts of the prodigals - once they are home in full numbers.
