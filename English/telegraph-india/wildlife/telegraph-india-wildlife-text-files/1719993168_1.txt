Baripada, March 15: Wildlife officials of the Karanjia forest division have thwarted entry of tribal hunters into the Similipal sanctuary. Yesterday, around 150 poachers belonging to at least four villages - Baliposhi, Khadiaposhi, Kerketbeda, and Chirpada - surrounding the Mituani forest beat had made an attempt to enter the sanctuary through Karketabeda under Thakurmunda range. They were armed with traditional weapons, including bows, arrows, axes and battleaxes. But, the timely intervention by the wildlife officials stalled their entry. The poachers had congregated at Jahirasolo to worship their deity and seek blessings for their Akhand Sikar (hunting), an age-old practice adopted by the tribal people. They then enter the forest. On learning about the move, the wildlife personnel, headed by local assistant conservator of forests, reached the site and dissuaded them from entering the sanctuary. Police had accompanied the forest personnel. Thakurmunda assistant conservator of forests Achyuta Mohanty said: "The villagers were convinced and their Akhand Sikar mission was stalled after a lot of persuasions." "The poachers were ensured of protection of their livelihood through various government schemes, including those in farming of poultry, duckery, goatery cattle rearing," he said. Wildlife expert Bhanumitra Acharya said: "Earlier, the tribal people used to venture into the forest for Akhand Sikar, especially during the Makara festival (in January) and Mahavishuv Sankranti (in April). But nowadays, they are entering the forest round the year." "Diverting their attention by organising sports, games and entertainment is one of the major tools to prevent them from hunting," he said.
