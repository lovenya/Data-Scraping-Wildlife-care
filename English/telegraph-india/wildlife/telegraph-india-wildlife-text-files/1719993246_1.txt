Kohima, July 5: W. Honje Konyak, deputy commissioner, Kohima, speaking at function held at Wildlife Breeding Home at Gasia, High School Colony here today, said “collective effort is necessary to educate the public regarding awareness on the ban on wildlife hunting.” The deputy commissioner was at the venue to release birds bred by the proprietor of Wildlife Breeding Home, Ruovuotuo Belho. Konyak said he was very impressed and touched by the good work initiated by Belho and that it was “an unique and significant example by a Naga.” The Nagas are usually known for hunting and killing wildlife. He appreciated the actions of the proprietor who has been spending from his pocket to maintain the mini zoo. The deputy commissioner said all men should learn  and emulate Belho and called upon the youths and the Church to come forward with awareness programmes regarding the ban on wildlife hunting. Among a variety of animals, the breeding home houses 13 deer, some of which the proprietor hopes to release into the wild by next year. The short programme was chaired by president T. Khel  Youth organisation, Ruokuophrelie Belho. The Nagaland Baptist Church Council has also banned hunting of wildlife and asked the church to create an awareness among the people. The council has also declared first Sunday of June as “Green Sunday” every year.
