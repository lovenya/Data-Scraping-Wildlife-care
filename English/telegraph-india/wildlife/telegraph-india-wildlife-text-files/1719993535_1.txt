Trap cameras will be set up at the Dalma Wildlife sanctuary in April-May. Though 30 cameras are already at the disposal of Dalma authorities, five-six cameras will be set up initially. Assistant conservator of forests R.P. Singh said trap cameras would help keep tabs on animal movement, as well as any instances of poaching or tree felling. “The cameras will be set up at strategic locations across the sanctuary in April or May,” Singh confirmed. Trap camera is a remotely activated camera equipped with a motion sensor or an infrared sensor. It captures wild animals on film. Forest authorities so far did not install these gadgets for fear of their getting stolen or destroyed by Naxalites. However, in recent years, rebel threat has virtually ceased to exist at the 192sqkm sanctuary near Jamshedpur. A forest ranger said they could now go ahead with setting up trap cameras at the sanctuary. “Rebel threat no longer exists. Cameras will be set up in phases at strategic points,” he said. Right now, trackers or village youths hired as daily wage earners keep tabs on animal movement, but the cameras would help track animals and illegal activity even at remote locations.
