Imaging solutions and photography products major Nikon is seeing a continuing shift in consumer preference for mirrorless digital cameras amid rising demand for high-definition video shooting among digital content creators. "We started with two models in 2018-19 and now we have nine models in the mirrorless camera segment," Sajjan Kumar, managing director of Nikon India, told The Telegraph.  He added that there is both a technology and adaptation shift toward mirrorless cameras from DSLR cameras. "We are strong in both DSLR as well as mirrorless. But the customer is driving the market and not the brand and we are fulfilling the customer requirement. Presently consumption of videos is getting more and more prominence and mirrorless cameras with their lighter bodies are easier to shoot videos with high resolution," Kumar said. The company is seeing demand for mirrorless devices coming from both hobbyists as well as professional photographers across segments such as weddings, wildlife, landscape, vloggers and YouTubers. "For instance in the case of a food vlogger, the texture, the quality, the colour is very important and that's where a professional device comes handy," Kumar said. Nikon has seen steady growth in the eastern market and is hoping for a double-digit growth rate in the ongoing fiscal. "We are already at pre-Covid levels when it comes to eastern markets. We have grown by almost 20 per cent in FY23. In our product categories east contributes about 13-16 per cent. In FY24 we hope to continue with double-digit growth," Kumar said. The company has also announced its plan to directly enter the healthcare sector through its biological range of microscopes and is looking to expand its tie-ups with government institutions and private labs.
