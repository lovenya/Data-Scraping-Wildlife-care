A Bishnoi organisation has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming that deer were being "dropped" into the Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh to feed the cheetahs recently brought there from Namibia and said the practice should end. In a tweet, BJP leader Kuldeep Bishnoi also cited "reports" about deer being fed to the cheetahs recently reintroduced in India. "I request the central government to get the matter investigated in view of the species of deer which are on the verge of extinction in Rajasthan and the sentiments of the Bishnoi society. And if the information is found to be true, then it should be stopped immediately," he said in a tweet in Hindi. The community is known for revering the blackbuck, and wildlife in general. In its letter, Akhil Bhartiya Bishnoi Mahasabha has stated that it is very pained after coming to know about the practice as it is working hard to protect the specie from all the danger and threat. It further questioned how come the government has brought cheetahs, who have been long extinct, into India but is paying no attention to its wildlife species that are nearing extinction. Meanwhile, siblings Freddy and Alton, two of the eight cheetahs brought from Namibia, were seen frolicking in their quarantine enclosure in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno National Park on Monday, a day after all of them were served food for the first time since their arrival in India. Sisters Savannah and Sasha also looked cheerful. The four other cheetahs - Obaan, Asha, Cibili, Saisa - also appeared in good spirits, KNP officials said. The eight felines - five female and three male and aged between 30 to 66 months - were on Sunday evening served food for the first time since their arrival from the African country to India on Saturday, an official said as quoted by PTI. On Sunday evening, each of the eight cheetahs was served two kg of buffalo meat. Only one of them ate less, the official said, adding that there was nothing concerning about it.
