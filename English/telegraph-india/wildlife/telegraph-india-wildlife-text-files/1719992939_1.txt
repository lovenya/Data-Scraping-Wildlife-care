Four foresters from Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary are in the race for Hem Chand Mahindra Wildlife Foundation (HCMWF) and Saevus Wildlife Warrior Awards 2015 - an honour aimed at recognising individual contribution to conservation across the country. The Ranchi wildlife division has recommended the names of Dalma range officer Mangal Kachhap, forester Dinesh Kumar, forest guard Kaleshwar Bhagat and tracker Mirja Shamim Akhtar Baig for the awards. Ranchi divisional forest officer Kamlesh Pandey said he received a call from the foundation last month. "A a two-member team from the Mumbai-based foundation visited Dalma earlier this week to interview the four. The team also visited the Dalma range office in Mango," he said while speaking to The Telegraph. Briefing about their contributions, Pandey said Kachhap, also an assistant conservator of forests, Gumla, had been working in the sanctuary for over five years. Kumar handles the Bhadodih forest beat. Bhagat is a veteran guard who keeps elephants at his beck and call while Baig provides timely information about the movement of jumbos close to villages dotting the 192sq km sanctuary. They also spread awareness about the futility of killing animals, especially during Sendra (an annual tribal hunting festival) and felling trees. HCMWF and Saevus Wildlife Magazine jointly started the award in 2013. They reward individuals associated with wildlife protection and conservation in the country. The award sum is worth Rs 50,000 each. This year, the foundation has decided to honour employees of 10 wildlife sanctuaries. The nominations will be subjected to an extensive review by Saevus after which the names of the shortlisted candidates would be forwarded to the jury for consideration.
