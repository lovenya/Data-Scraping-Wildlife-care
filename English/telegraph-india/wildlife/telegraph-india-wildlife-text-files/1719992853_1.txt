Guwahati: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a peasants' organisation in Assam, staged a protest at Panjabari here on Sunday morning, demanding a halt in the eviction drive scheduled to resume inside Amchang wildlife sanctuary on Monday. The KMSS has submitted a memorandum to Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, calling for a solution to the settlement issue through discussions. The eviction drive was launched in August, but was suspended after two days because of massive protests. Forest department sources said over 3,000 police, forest and disaster response personnel besides at least 10 elephants and excavators have been mobilised for the eviction drive which will continue till Wednesday. Acting on a Gauhati High Court order, altogether 283 dwellings, including concrete structures, were demolished inside the sanctuary during the two-day eviction in August at Yusufnagar (a hilltop at Botahghuli) and Kankannagar-Nabajyotinagar near the College of Veterinary Science. It was estimated that there are nearly 3,000 families inside the wildlife sanctuary, but some had shifted to other places before the eviction was launched. KMSS leader Dhaijjya Konwar, in a statement on Sunday, alleged that the Sonowal government is evicting the indigenous people from the area in order to hand over land to business groups. The district administration officials, however, said the eviction will be carried out as they have settled inside the wildlife sanctuary. Three Mising students' organisations have called a 12-hour Assam bandh on Monday.
