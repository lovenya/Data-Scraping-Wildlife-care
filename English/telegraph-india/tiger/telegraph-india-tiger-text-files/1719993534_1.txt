Tiger cubs are born blind. For the first two months, they feed on their mother’s milk…. And if one more tiger is killed, there will be a serious threat to the entire ecological system including our own food and security… These are some lessons learnt  from the Kids for Tiger programme, an interactive session conducted by wildlife magazine Sanctuary Asia for school students. The programme is aimed at creating awareness about tigers and their importance in the ecological system. “We want to build an active force of these children, who can fight for the conservation of tigers,” said Joydip Kundu, who is conducting the programme for Sanctuary Asia. In Calcutta, the programme will be conducted in more than 40 schools for students till Class X. “The objective is to tell these children about the consequences if tigers disappear. We are spreading the word to save tigers and forests, which will benefit the coming generations, ” added Kundu. The programme will cover topics like poaching and how it is carried out during the monsoon, when the sanctuaries are closed to tourists. The programme will be taken to more than 1,000 schools across the country. “We are also conducting some programmes in and around the forests. We want to make the youth understand the importance of nature and its conservation. Directly, they cannot help in conservation but they can write to the government, media and spread the word in their community,” said Kundu. “A lot of people are concerned about environmental hazards, but are confused about  how to tackle them. I feel common people like us can bring about changes, either by destroying nature or conserving it,” feels Bittu Sehgal, editor of Sanctuary Asia.
