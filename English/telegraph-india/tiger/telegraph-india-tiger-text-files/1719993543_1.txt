Orlando: Henrik Stenson turned in a sizzling eight-under 64 to grab the first-round lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Thursday, while Tiger Woods was back near the top of the leaderboard and on the prowl for a ninth Bay Hill title. Anirban Lahiri, who needs nothing less than a win to get into the Masters, opened with a one-over 73. Lahiri even held sole lead at one point but finished lying tied 69th. Stenson, who missed the cut at last week’s PGA Tour stop the Valspar Championship, started his round quietly with three pars but then birdied nine of his next 13 holes including five straight from the ninth. The only blemish on an otherwise polished card was a bogey at the 14th that interrupted a magical run of seven birdies over eight holes before the Swede closed out his round with two pars for a one shot lead over Americans Talor Gooch and Aaron Wise. Lurking two shots farther back at five-under after 67s are a trio of Americans including Rickie Fowler, Jimmy Walker and Bryson DeChambeau. But the man in the spotlight once again was Woods — near the top of the leaderboard after carding a rock solid four-under 68 to share seventh with compatriot Patrick Reed and South Korean An Byeong-hun. A record eight-time winner on the Bay Hill layout, the former world No. 1 was in vintage form, mixing six birdies with a single double bogey to put a marker down for a ninth Palmer Invitational title. “I thought I played well.” Woods told reporters.
