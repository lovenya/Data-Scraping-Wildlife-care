Calcutta/Goaltore/Salboni: A forest guard and a driver on tiger watch suffocated to death in their vehicle after they rolled up the windows to keep out bugs. Damodar Murmu, 37, and driver Amal Chakrabarty, 40, had retired to the mini-truck after dinner on Monday night. They were found dead by villagers around 5.30am on Tuesday. The tiger that has eluded four traps after being clicked by hidden cameras near Lalgarh on March 2 has put fear in the hearts of villagers. From taking turns at night vigil to relieving themselves in the village instead of the forest, people have tailored their day-to-day activities in a way to evade the fearsome big cat.
