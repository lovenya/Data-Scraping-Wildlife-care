Melbourne: Tiger Woods gave Australian golf fans a taste of what they have been missing over the last decade by shooting a six-under-par 66 for a share of the first round lead at the Australian Masters Thursday. Woods, playing in Australia for the first time in 11 years, thrilled galleries packed six-deep on each hole, notching seven birdies for a one-stroke lead with South Africa’s Branden Grace and Australian James Nitties. “I hit the ball pretty decent. I didn’t get my irons that close but took advantage of the par fives,” the world No. 1 said at the co-sanctioned $1.5 million ($1.4 million) event. Chasing his first Australian title on his fourth visit Down Under, Woods will face a tougher task on Friday with an afternoon tee-off likely to bring gusting winds and soaring temperatures.
