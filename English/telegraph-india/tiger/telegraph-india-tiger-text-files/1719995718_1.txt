Shahid Kapoor, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra set the stage on fire before Shah Rukh Khan stole the show during the opening ceremony of Women’s Premier League in Bengaluru, making the entire M. Chinnaswamy Stadium sway to his moves on Jhoome Jo Pathaan on February 23. Sporting a man-in-black look and long locks, Shah Rukh rocked the opening ceremony right from the start as his entry elicited loud applause from the crowd. “Tumhari nawazi ke liye Pathaan toh aayega hi....nachega, nachayega aur jhomega [Pathaan will come to welcome you...he will dance, he will make you dance and he will groove]”, the Bollywood star told his fans, promising an entertaining evening. As the actor proceeded to perform on Jhoome Jo Pathaan, the title track of his 2023 blockbuster Pathaan, the stadium reverberated with enthusiastic cheers from his fans. He also shook a leg on Not Ramaiya Vastavaiya — a track from Atlee’s Jawan. Shah Rukh’s signature arms-stretch-out pose brought the magnetic performance to its end. Shahid, who represented Mumbai Indians at the ceremony, made a fiery entry into the stadium, with the background score of Kabir Singh accompanying his smooth ride into the performance arena. He sported a white vest and matching white trousers with blue sequined patterns whirling across them. The actor then grooved to the beats of Shaandaar, the title track of his 2015 romcom. Representing UP Warriorz, Varun grooved to the beats of his superhit songs, including Tu Mera Koi Na Hoke Bhi Kuch Laage and Palat - Tera Hero Idhar Hai. His shiny outfit comprised a glittery jacket paired with metallic trousers. Kartik Aaryan attended the ceremony to support Gujarat Giants and grooved to the beats of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2’s title track, while Tiger Shroff rooted for Royal Challengers Bangalore and flaunted his chiselled body while dancing to Whistle Baja from his debut film Heropanti and Ghungroo from Yash Raj Films’ 2019 spy drama War.
