Christopher Snedden claims that this book is not a 'tell-all history' but a work that offers the "dispute's broad historic and geo-strategic antecedents". He challenges the idea that the dispute was started by the Pakhtun tribesmen in 1947 who were supported by Pakistan. Instead, Snedden argues that the Kashmiris themselves lit the fire after British and Dogra rule had come to an end. The deliberate sidelining of Kashmiris, Snedden writes, is the reason why a solution to the dispute remains elusive. The discord is also related to the accession of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir to India and the plebiscite question. After the British left, hundreds of princely states acceded to both India and Pakistan. But Kashmir's accession remains a bone of contention. The contradictory postures of India and Pakistan add to the confusion about the legitimate position of Jammu and Kashmir. The book clears some of the haze surrounding Kashmir's history. It also wades into the knotty arguments concerning the political discourse to resolve a dilemma that has created a lot of distrust. Snedden presents a comprehensive account of Kashmir. He does not shy away from addressing the question of azaadi. His answer may not be to the liking of many on both sides of the border. Snedden talks of an opinion poll to know whether the people of Kashmir want to stay with India or Pakistan or are in favour of independence. It is not as if attempts have not been made to resolve the Kashmir issue by India and Pakistan. But there is a trust deficit as well as a lack of desire to end the conflict. Neither India and Pakistan nor the other nations of the world seem to feel the urgency to find a solution to the dispute. Any solution, Snedden insists, must take into consideration the views of the Kashmiris.
