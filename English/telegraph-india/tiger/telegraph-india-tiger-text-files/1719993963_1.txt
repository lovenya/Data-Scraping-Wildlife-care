Moore knight London, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Former James Bond actor, Roger Moore, will be knighted by Queen Elizabeth tomorrow in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Moore, 76, who has been a goodwill ambassador for the Unicef since 1991, was awarded the knighthood in the monarch’s birthday honours list in June. Moore took over the role of agent 007 in the 1973 film Live and Let Die after shooting to fame in the 1960s television series The Saint. He went on to star in another six Bond films. His last was 1985’s A View to a Kill. May, he was fitted with a pacemaker after he collapsed on stage during a Broadway performance. Tiger trauma New York (Reuters): Battered and bitten                       and facing seven years in prison, a man who made national                       headlines for keeping a fierce tiger in his New York apartment                       said he still loves the beast and misses him terribly. Arraigned                       on Tuesday in Manhattan Criminal Court, Antoine Yates, 31,                       was charged with two counts of reckless endangerment and                       possession of a wild animal, all revolving around Ming,                       a 180 kg, 20-month-old Siberian-Bengal tiger discovered                       by authorities on Saturday. Yates, a part-time taxi driver,                       was arrested on Sunday at a Philadelphia hospital where                       he was treated for bites from Ming, who attacked him when                       he tried to protect a kitten from the tiger. “I still feel                       heartbroken, torn up. The pain is nothing. It is the pain                       in my heart that really bothers me. I really do miss him,”                       Yates said. Stable star London (Reuters): If life does exist elsewhere, it’s likely to be on a middle-aged star in the constellation of Gemini, according to an American scientist. Astrobiologist Maggie Turnbull, of the University of Arizona in Tucson, has compiled a shortlist of 30 possibly habitable planets and stars and one called 37 Gem is her top choice. “This stable, middle-aged star is just a bit hotter and brighter than our sun. And if alien life is anywhere, it’s likely to be there,” New Scientist magazine said on Wednesday. Turnbull made the list for Nasa’s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), a space telescope project that will search for habitable planets after it is launched in about 10 years time. The amount of heavy metal present when the star is formed and its age were important criteria for Turnbull. But Gem 37, the 37th brightest star in the constellation of Gemini, came out on top because it looks most like our sun. “The closer we look, the more we realise how (most) other stars are different from the sun,” Turnbull said.
