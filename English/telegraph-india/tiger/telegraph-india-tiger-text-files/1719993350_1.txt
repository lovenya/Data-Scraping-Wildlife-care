Siliguri: The three cubs of Shila, the female royal Bengal Tiger at the Bengal Safari Park near here, have finally been named by none other than chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The cubs, all females, were born at the park in May this year. Since then, the cubs are being kept at a separate enclosure. They are yet to be released in the enclosure where people move in vehicles to enjoy a tiger safari. Among the three, one is an albino. "We had requested the chief minister to name the cubs. She has names them as Kika, Rika and Ika. All the three are safe and have been kept in quarantine under observation of foresters at the park. Once we get permission from vets, all the three will be released at the park so that visitors can see them," said Binay Krishna Burman, the state forest minister, on Friday. The park that is spread over an area of 290 hectares and is on the fringes of Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary has three royal Bengal tigers (two male and a female), two leopards, a one-horn rhino, two Himalayan black bear, elephants, six gharials (fish-eating crocodiles), deer and an aviary of different species of birds. As of now, tiger and Himalayan black bear safari and elephant safari are available for tourists. Asked about the prospective time for the cubs to be released for sight seeing, a forest officer said it would take some more months. "We are keeping them under observation. Vets are examining them on a regular basis to ensure that they are healthy. The cubs are around four months old now and we believe they would be kept aloof for at least three more months. It is likely to be on this year-end that the cubs would be released," he said.
