Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan and Shahid Kapoor motivated women cricketers of Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals before performing dance moves in the rehearsal for the opening ceremony of the Women’s Premier League (WPL), show videos shared by the official Instagram page of WPL on Thursday. Clad in a white full-sleeved t-shirt with camouflage trousers, Shah Rukh performed his signature arms-stretched-out pose in the first video, sweeping the young cricketers off their feet. The girls could not hold their excitement as the Jawan star put his hand on their head to bless them for their upcoming match. Shah Rukh also met with former Indian cricketer Sourav Ganguly, who is the current director of cricket for Delhi Capitals. “KING👑 meets Queens👸The @mumbaiindians and @delhicapitals had a surprise visitor and they surely couldn't hold back their excitement seeing King Khan @iamsrk at the nets,” the WPL committee captioned the video. The second video shows Shahid, whose Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya alongside Kriti Sanon is currently running in theatres, entering the stadium and telling the cricketers about his love for the game. “I wanted to be a cricketer growing up. When I come to a stadium, I am full of excitement. I am like a kid who gets the chance to enter a candy store,” he said in the video. The 42-year-old actor also recalled the moment when his daughter Misha asked him whether women play cricket like men do. “She’s very sporty. My son likes cricket so she wanted to compete with him. So, I showed her some of the matches and I told her that girls can play cricket and they are great at it,” he said, promising that he would watch WPL matches at home with his children. Apart from Shah Rukh and Shahid, Sidharth Malhotra, Kartik Aaryan and Tiger Shroff are also set to perform in the opening ceremony of this year’s WPL. With its first season played in March 2023, the second edition of the league will kick off on February 23 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru from 6:30 pm, following a star-studded opening ceremony.
