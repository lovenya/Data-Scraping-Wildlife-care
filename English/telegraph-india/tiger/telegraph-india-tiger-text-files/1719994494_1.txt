New Delhi, July 31 (PTI): Legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev will start alongside Tiger Woods at the Deutsche Bank PGA golf championship in Boston. The World Cup winning skipper, also an avid golfer, is one of the few from the global golfing community to be selected for the Boston championship, the newest event on the PGA Tour. “It is a great opportunity.
