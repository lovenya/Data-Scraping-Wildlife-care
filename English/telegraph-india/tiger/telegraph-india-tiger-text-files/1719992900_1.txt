Baripada, April 18: Authorities of the Similipal Tiger Reserve are making efforts to shift the tribal people residing at Jamuna village, which is located in the core area of the sanctuary. There are 35 such families who, during a village meeting last year, had agreed to shift out of the forest area. Official sources said the authorities need Rs 3.5 crore towards rehabilitation compensation as each family will have to be paid Rs 10 lakh. Besides, the district administration will provide each family with a pucca house.

District collector Rajesh Prabhakar Patil said a suitable piece of land had been identified to relocate the families. The process was on to ensure that they were given pucca houses and cash incentives, so that they could shift out of the forest area. The administration has identified five acres at Nabra in Udla block for the resettlement. Their representatives have also visited the proposed settlement area, said wildlife activist Bhanoomitra Acharya. Deputy director of the reserve forest Ajit Satpathy said: “We were expecting the National Tiger Conservation Authority to provide us with the relief fund for the families. The amount is yet to be received. But, we are planning to arrange the money, so that the shifting could take place without any further delay.” The forest authorities had earlier succeeded in shifting tribal settlements from the core area and relocate them to identified pockets. At present, there are only three villages Jamuna, Kabatghai and Bakua that are inhabited by the ethnic people in the core area. “Although authorities had considered Similipal for the status of a national park, yet notification couldn’t be made till date because of the presence of these villages within its proposed area,” said a senior officer.
