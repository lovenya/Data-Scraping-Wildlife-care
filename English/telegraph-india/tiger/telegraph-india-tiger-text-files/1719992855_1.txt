Madrid: Rafael Nadal still admires scandal-hit golfer Tiger Woods and believes the media were wrong in publishing details of the American world No. 1’s private life. “The first thing I think (about the Woods issue) is that society is in a bad way,” the Spanish world No. 4 said in an interview with a Spanish sports daily. “Starting with the sports media, we have to judge Tiger as an athlete. His private life is his business and nobody else’s. I still admire him because he is an exemplary athlete.” After going into self-imposed exile following revelations about his extra-marital affairs, Woods will return at next month’s US Masters, the opening major of the year and an event he has won four times. “It’s funny because a lot of the people who criticised him now want him to come back because sport in general needs him,” Nadal said. The Mallorca-born Nadal returned from a six week injury layoff to reach the Indian Wells semi-finals last week but said he was unsure if he was back to his best level following his knee problems. “I don’t know, I need to keep improving,” the six-time Grand Slam winner said.
