Tiger Woods is roaring less than a month after he was seriously injured in a car accident. The golfer has signed an exclusive multi-year deal with Take-Two Interactive Software to feature his name and likeness in future golf video games. Golf-related video games have always been extremely popular and the 45-year-old was previously the face of Electronic Arts PGA Tour video game between 1998 and 2013. The importance of the upcoming video game is high as the video game publisher has also agreed to acquire the small studio that makes its PGA Golf 2K series in which Woods will help in the development process. New York-based Take-Two is known for its Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and other hit franchises. The company has enjoyed great success last year as demand for gaming shot up when people stayed at home last year. Sports video games form one of the industryâ€™s best-selling franchises, with Electronic Arts being the biggest publisher in the category while Take-Two has lately grown its sports portfolio in a big way. According to analytics firm Sensor Tower, golf games accounted for eight of the top 100 most downloaded mobile sports titles globally last year. Earlier this month, the champion golfer underwent surgery on his right leg after, suffering multiple open fractures in the tibia and fibula bones, as well as injuries to his foot and ankle, following a rollover crash in California.
