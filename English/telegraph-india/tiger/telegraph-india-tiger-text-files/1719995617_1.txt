Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif-starrer Tiger 3 has been experiencing gradual slowdown throughout the week, climaxing in the collection of only Rs 12.42 crore over the weekend in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Despite an impressive opening on November 12, the Maneesh Sharma-helmed spy action thriller witnessed a lukewarm response in theatres in the subsequent week as it could amass an estimated Rs 6.65 crore nett on Day 15,  bringing the total Indian collection across all languages to Rs 271.09 crore nett. According to trade figures, Tiger 3 managed to rake in a substantial sum of Rs 187.65 crore nett in its first week, comprising Rs 183 crore nett in Hindi, Rs 4.02 crore nett in Telugu and Rs 63 lakh nett in Tamil. The film's second-week earnings, however, saw a dramatic fall amounting to Rs 67.22 crore nett, with Rs 66 crore nett in Hindi, Rs 75 lakh nett in Telugu and Rs 47 lakh nett in Tamil. On the 13th day of its release, the latest instalment in the YRF Spy Universe earned Rs 3.8 crore nett (Hindi: Rs 3.75 crore nett, Telugu: Rs 4 lakh nett, Tamil: Rs 1 lakh nett), while on the 14th day, it recorded collections of Rs 5.77 crore nett (Hindi: Rs 5.75 crore nett, Telugu: Rs 1 lakh nett, Tamil: Rs 1 lakh nett). Internationally, the Salman-starrer amassed Rs 420 crore gross until Saturday. It now faces a critical four-day window before the release of Ranbir Kapoor's Animal on December 1. The thriller, about to hit theatres soon, is expected to draw a significant portion of the movie-going crowd and hit Tiger 3â€™s collections even more. Tiger 3,which sees Salman and Katrina reprising their roles as Tiger and Zoya, also introduces Emraan Hashmi to the franchise as the antagonist Aatish Rahman.
