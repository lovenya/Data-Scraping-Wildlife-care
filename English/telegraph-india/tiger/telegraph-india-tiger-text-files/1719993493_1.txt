Bettiah: Four women of Tharu community on Monday accused nine forest employees, including a forester, of molesting them in Valmikinagar Tiger Reserve (VTR) area. In a complaint lodged with the women's commission (district helpline) here, the women charged VTR forester Vijay Kumar Pathak, ranger Sunil Kumar Singh and seven other employees with misbehaviour and molestation in the forests of VTR on January 25. One of the women, a resident of Bherihar village, told reporters that she along with other women of her village, was working in the field when forest employees during their routine patrolling passed lewd comments. "When protested, the forest employees tried to drag four of us inside the forest holding our arms. They escaped after a crowd gathered hearing our distress call," she said, as three other women stood by her side. Forest officials could not be contacted for comments.
