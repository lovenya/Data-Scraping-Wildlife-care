Officials of Nandankanan zoo in Odisha are taking all efforts to save two royal Bengal tiger cubs who are suffering from paralysis. The cubs had celebrated their first birthday on January 9. Zoo veterinarian Dr Alok Das told The Telegraph: “The two cubs — Luv and Kush — sons of tigress Sneha, were fine till January 26. But soon after we found them looking ill, less cheerful and less active than usual. We started their treatment on a war-footing. After conducting X-ray, blood test and other examinations, we came to the conclusion that they are suffering from paralysis. It’s difficult to treat small cubs as they will not follow discipline and routine as we would like them to.” Das added: “We have already informed the Central Zoo Authority. We have also discussed the problem with Dr Edward Ramsay, who is a professor of the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine in the US. We have also consulted eminent veterinary surgeons of our country, including the doctors of the Wildlife Institute of India.” The two cubs are now kept in the isolation ward under constant observation with the help of closed-circuit cameras. “The two cubs are being given the best possible treatment. We have expertise in the treatment of animals. Last year we conducted blood transfusion of a tiger. Now we are exploring whether any further improvement can be made in our treatment strategy to save the cubs. But treating paralytic animals needs patience, time and willingness to serve,” said Das. Nandankanan zoo, located on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar, has 27 tigers, including eight white ones. The zoo which was closed because of the coronavirus pandemic for seven months, opened its doors to the public last October. “There is a good response from the visitors. They are coming in good numbers and adhering to Covid guidelines,” a zoo official said. The zoo has nearly 3,700 animals and 158 species of birds and reptiles. The animals are available for adoption.
