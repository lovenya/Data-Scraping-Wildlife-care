The butterfly conservatory set up  last year by the state forest department at Rajabhatkhawa in Buxa Tiger Reserve of Alipurduar district is drawing hundreds of visitors every day. Tourists to eastern Dooars as well as residents of Alipurduar and Cooch Behar are visiting what’s popularly called butterfly park. Around 100-150 visit on weekdays and upto 350 on weekends. According to sources in the state forest department around 400 species of butterflies have been spotted in the conservatory so far. “In the past one month alone, around 50 species of colourful butterflies have been spotted here. We hope the number of species will go up,” said Tamaghna Sengupta, in-charge of the conservatory. Among the butterfly species are Blue Tiger, Common Crow, Great Eggfly, Striped Tiger, Common Birdwing and Gray Panjim. In north Bengal, there are two other similar centres, one located at Ramsai which is on the fringes of Gorumara National Park in Jalpaiguri district, and the other in Kulik Bird Sanctuary area on the outskirts of Raiganj town in North Dinajpur district. “However, the butterfly park here in Rajabhatkhawa has surpassed the other two parks in terms of the number of species. It has been decided that plants of flax, curry, power-puff, allamanda and cuphea would be planted as butterflies prefer these species,” Sengupta added. He said every day, hundreds of visitors are pouring in at the conservatory to see the species and click pictures. “Our department has already published some books on the butterflies of Buxa and there are plans to come up with some more books. There is also a plan to set up a selfie zone and a curio centre here. Also, pictures of types of butterflies will be displayed at the park so that people can learn more about the species,” the forest official said.
