Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif-starrer Tiger 3 managed to mint Rs 13 crore nett on Friday, crossing the Rs 200-crore mark at the domestic box office on its sixth day in theatres, according to trade reports. The total six-day collection of the movie, which also features Emraan Hashmi in the antagonist’s role, now stands at Rs 200.65 crore nett in India. However, the Maneesh Sharma-helmed spy action thriller continued its downward slide in terms of daily collection. As suggested by trade figures, the movie’s Friday earnings dipped more than three times its opening-day collection of Rs 44.50 crore nett in India. After its decent Diwali opening on Sunday, Tiger 3 collected Rs 59.25 crore nett on Day 2, followed by Rs 44.30 crore nett on Day 3. Things began to get worse for the latest instalment in the YRF Spy Universe right from Day 4 as it could only amass Rs 21.10 crore nett on Wednesday and Rs 18.50 crore nett on Thursday. Despite its sluggish progress, Tiger 3 has emerged as the fourth-highest Hindi grosser of 2023 in terms of six-day collections. Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan had earned Rs 345 crore nett in the first six days of theatrical run. Pathaan, also headlined by Shah Rukh, minted Rs 307 crore nett during the same period. Sunny Deol's Gadar 2 occupied the third spot with an earning of Rs 261 crore nett in the first six days. Salman Khan plays Avinash Rathore aka Tiger in Tiger 3, while Katrina Kaif plays his wife Zoya. The spy action thriller is the third instalment in the Tiger franchise and the fifth film in YRF Spy Universe.
