Madhu Neotia was Excited with a capital E as she showed us around Swabhumi on Sunday afternoon, pointing out the different zones in which the exhibition will be spread over. “The What’s Next section will be where all the fun will be… this will have all the young designers and artists… just look how huge it is!” she said. Immediately after that she drew our attention to a huge installation by Abin Chaudhuri under construction. “This will be made up of mirrors completely, just imagine how beautiful it will look. And Narayan’s (Sinha) installation will make up the entrance, you will have to enter through it,” she smiled. Yes, there was no stopping #TIS Madhu. “Everybody is working so hard and the team is working till late at night and I am trying to spend as much time here as possible,” she said, explaining why she was giving the ATK vs FC Goa match a miss that evening. Keep Calm and #TIS on is the mantra for core team members Abhilasha Sethia and Nil. “I am feeling nervous, tired and sleepless, but I am holding on. This time it is much more under control and I am enjoying this nervous energy. I wish I had 10 hands though!” said the fashion designer. The last time Abhilasha had ditched home for hotel in Calcutta was for her son’s wedding. “I would keep forgetting something every day,” she laughed. This time when she puts up at Hyatt Regency to stay as close to Swabhumi as possible, she hopes to be “more organised” and not add to her stress. “I think we all need to keep calm. That’s what I have been telling myself and also everybody else around. Everything is going to fall in place,” she smiled. The India Story 2016, in association with t2, will be held at Swabhumi from October 20-23
