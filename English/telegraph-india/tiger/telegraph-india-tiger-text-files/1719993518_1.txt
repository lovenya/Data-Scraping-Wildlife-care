New York, Sept. 24 (PTI): Actor Leonardo DiCaprio will visit India soon to see tigers in the wild and promote global awareness about their dwindling numbers. The Titanic star, who is an ambassador of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), met Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh in New York yesterday to discuss ways to  get involved in tiger conservation. “He is very keen to work  on tiger conservation. He wants to take on a more visible role. Somebody like him could play an important role in  sensitising the global  community to the cause of the Indian tiger,” Ramesh  said. Earlier this year, DiCaprio had visited Nepal to assess the preservation programmes in the country to save the big cat which is on the brink of extinction. There are only an estimated 3,200 tigers left in the wild and India’s tiger reserves  are home to a sizeable  chunk of the global tiger population.
