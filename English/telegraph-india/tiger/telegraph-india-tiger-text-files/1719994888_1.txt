Tiger Woods is back at home in Florida to resume his recovery from career-threatening leg injuries he suffered when his SUV ran off a road and down a hill in the Los Angeles suburbs last month. “Happy to report that I am back home and continuing my recovery,” Woods said in a tweet posted on Tuesday night. “I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks.” Woods was injured on February 23, two days after the Genesis Invitational at Riviera. He was on his way to a television shoot for GolfTV a little after 7am when his SUV crashed into a median, rolled over and ended up on its side near a steep road known for wrecks, authorities said. The 45-year-old golfer — one of the most recognisable sports figures in the world — had to be pulled out through the windshield. Rory McIlroy, who has a home near Woods in Jupiter, Florida, said in an interview last week with talk show host Jimmy Fallon that Woods was “doing better” and it would be “great” for him to be back at his home with his family. Several leading players have said Woods has been in contact with them during his stay in hospital via text messages.
