Siliguri, June 7: A Siliguri-based NGO has appealed to the forest department to conduct a survey in the forests of north Bengal to find out the tiger population in the region. The NGO has said that a separate database would help the forest department understand the future trends of survival among the big cats. “Tigers are found mainly in the Buxa Tiger Reserve, Neora Valley and Mahananda and Jaldapara wildlife sanctuaries. But apart from BTR, animals in other places are not monitored regularly and proper surveys are not conducted,” said Animesh Bose, programme co-ordinator of Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation. He said tigers should be monitored regularly to get a clear idea about their preying habits and movement. A source in the department said according to preliminary reports, there are 10-12 tigers in Neora Valley that measures 88sqkm. Jaldapara  (216sqkm) has six-10 big cats  and Mahananda sanctuary (159sqkm) has around eight-10 tigers. But there is no official database that enlists the figures. A census conducted in Bu-xa in 2009 revealed that there were 12 big cats in the forest spread over 738sqkm. The last census in the other forests was conducted about three-four years back. During the survey pugmarks and scat samples were sent for a DNA analysis to the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun, but the final reports were not collected by the department. “According to the guideline of the WWI the survey and monitoring of tigers are conducted across the country by the All India Tiger Monitoring project. As the database is maintained centrally we do not have to keep it separately here,” said V.K. Sood, the conservator of forest, wildlife circle (north).
