Calcutta, July 27: A tiger stealthily crept behind a man busy looking for fish and crabs in a shallow tributary of a Sunderbans river this morning, grabbed him by the neck and dragged him into the forest. The forest department has launched a search for Pratul Naskar, missing till late this evening. The Benipheli forest in the Kultali area of South 24-Parganas, about 180km from Calcutta, is a reserved forest and going there without permission is prohibited. Today’s strike is the fifth in less than a month (see box). Pratul and two others had started for the Benipheli forest on a mechanised fishing boat early this morning. “When we reached a place where the Thakurain river is shallow, we saw in the transparent water plenty of fish and crabs. We decided to get off the boat with out hand nets,” said one Mahadeb Naskar. The trio jumped into the waist-deep water and became engrossed in fishing, oblivious that a tiger could be watching them from behind a clump of trees 15-20 feet away. Suddenly, Pratul screamed and when the two others turned back, they saw him being dragged away by a tiger. “We tried to stop the tiger by throwing our nets at it but it climbed onto the bank with its teeth firmly sunk into Pratul’s neck and disappeared,” said Mahadeb. The two villagers climbed onto their boat immediately and returned to Deulbari village, around 20km away. They alerted other fishermen and forest department officials. Divisional forest officer, Subhendu Banerjee said: “Villagers are increasingly venturing into the reserved and core forest areas. We are worried.” He said foresters would hold meetings with villagers. “We want to make one thing clear that everyone going into the reserved forest must have permission. No one is allowed to go into the core area.”
