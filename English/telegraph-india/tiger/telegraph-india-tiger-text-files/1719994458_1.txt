Nainital: Uttarakhand High Court has asked the state government to evict all the illegal occupants of government buildings at Kalagarh, which falls within the core zone of the Corbett Tiger Reserve, within three weeks. The bench of Justices Rajiv Sharma and Lokpal Singh also asked the directors of the Corbett and Rajaji Tiger Reserves to preserve the viscera of all tigers that die unnaturally and videograph their post-mortems, besides getting their deaths probed by sub-divisional magistrates. It directed the state government to install security cameras and deploy drones to prevent poaching. The court fined an illegal occupant of a building in Kalagarh for filing a public interest plea challenging a government notification that demarcated the buffer and core areas of the Corbett Tiger Reserve. It held that Vishwanath Singh could not move such a petition being a squatter himself.
