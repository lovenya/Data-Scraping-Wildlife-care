Colombo, Feb. 27 (Reuters): The Italian and US ambassadors to Sri Lanka were slightly hurt today when Tamil Tiger rebels shelled a delegation of diplomats led by the island’s human rights minister to the restive east, officials said. Hospital officials in the eastern district of Batticaloa said Italian ambassador Pio Mariani had a small piece of shrapnel lodged in his head outside his skull, but that it was a minor wound. US ambassador Robert Blake’s arm was grazed either by shrapnel or a stone, the military said, but he was not taken to hospital and his embassy said he was fine. It is believed to be the first time western envoys have been caught up in the conflict since the rebels began fighting for a separate state in 1983. The LTTE said they were sorry the envoys were hurt by their fire, but blamed the army for putting them in harm’s way. The attack came as helicopters carrying disaster management and human rights minister Mahinda Samarasinghe as well as ambassadors from the US, EU, Japan, Germany and France landed in Batticaloa on a goodwill mission. The minister and the other ambassadors were unharmed, military and embassy officials said. “The LTTE has once again demonstrated its terrorist nature,” foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama  said in a statement from Beijing.
