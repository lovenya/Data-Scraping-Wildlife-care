Environment, forest and climate change minister Prakash Javadekar had in December said that tiger population in the country had increased by 750 in the last four years from 2,226 to 2,976. “Now the tiger count is 2,976.

Giving details of tiger deaths because of poaching, it said Maharashtra and Karnataka lost 28 tigers each because of hunting, 17 in Assam, 14 in Uttarakhand, 12 in Uttar Pradesh, 11 in Tamil Nadu, six in Kerala and three in Rajasthan, among others. The NTCA did not provide the details of action taken in these deaths in response to the RTI application. Asked about the details of missing tigers in the country, it said the information was not available with it and suggested the applicant to contact Chief Wildlife Warden (CWLW) of 18 states having tiger reserves to get the desired information. Wildlife activists have expressed concerns over 750 tiger deaths between 2012 and 2019 and supported stricter wildlife provisions to punish the guilty. “It is a matter of grave concern that tigers in such a large numbers have died due to poaching and other reasons. There is a need for stricter penal provisions for those found guilty of wildlife crimes,” said Bhopal-based wildlife activist Ajay Dubey. He said conservation needed to be expedited to save tigers from poachers. “Much attention is paid on tiger tourism by state governments concerned which is affecting their natural habitat. There is a need to speed up the efforts to conserve tiger. Government must make punishment for wildlife related crimes harsher,” Dubey said.
