Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif’s Diwali release Tiger 3 will follow the events of Hrithik Roshan’s 2019 film War and Shah Rukh Khan’s 2023 blockbuster Pathaan, the duo confirmed in a new poster of the upcoming spy-action thriller on Saturday. The poster, dropped days before the teaser launch of the film alongside Shah Rukh’s Jawan in theatres on September 7, shows Salman’s gun-wielding RAW agent Avinash ‘Tiger’ Singh Rathore alongside Katrina’s ISI agent Zoya ‘Zee’ Humaimi in a war-torn location. Salman rocks Tiger’s trademark handkerchief around his neck, while Katrina carries an automatic rifle and sports a bulletproof vest. . “No limits. No Fear. No turning back. #Tiger3 in theatres this Diwali. 💫 Celebrate #Tiger3 with #YRF50 only at a big screen near you. Releasing in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. @beingsalmankhan | #ManeeshSharma | @yrf,” Katrina wrote, sharing the poster on Instagram. Sharing the same poster on Instagram, Salman wrote, “Aa raha hoon! #Tiger3 on Diwali 2023. Celebrate #Tiger3 with #YRF50 only at a big screen near you. Releasing in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.” Helmed by Fan director Maneesh Sharma and produced by Aditya Chopra, Tiger 3 also stars Emraan Hashmi in a pivotal role. It is the fifth instalment in the YRF Spy Universe and the sequel to Tiger Zinda Hai (2017). It is rumoured that Shah Rukh Khan will make a cameo appearance in the film as RAW agent Pathaan.
