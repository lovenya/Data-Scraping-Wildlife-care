New York, Jan. 13 (PTI): Tiger Woods is reported to have checked into a sex rehabilitation centre in Arizona for treatment. People magazine reported that Woods, 34, is believed to have joined The Meadows, a clinic which specialises in substance abuse and compulsive disorders such as gambling or sex addiction, on New Year’s Day for a period of five weeks. “He should be out by Valentine’s Day (February 14) or thereabout,” a source told the entertainment magazine. Everyone at the clinic is asked to wear a coloured nametag that corresponds to their addiction. “He has been there for a few days since his handlers forced him to enter the programme. They feel that if he blames his cheating on addiction, the public will forgive him,” sources said.
