Orlando: Tiger Woods takes his rousing comeback tour to one of his favourite haunts - Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill layout, where the 14-time Major winner has triumphed eight times. Woods not only feels supremely confident on the track, but cherishes the time spent with Palmer, who traditionally greeted the tournament winner on the last green in the city Woods formerly called home. "To be able to win this tournament and to have Arnold there and to shake his hand and for him to give me a big hug and a couple of times he says: 'I called it, I knew you were going to make that putt.' "It was little things like that ... sharing jokes with him out there on the green and he and I laughing. Those are moments that unfortunately I'll never have, but I have those memories," Woods told reporters ahead of Thursday's opening round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods had a long relationship with seven-time Major winner Palmer, who died in September 2016 aged 87. Just keep getting better. . I'm learning how I can swing it and not swing it... these are all things that are new. So I'm still learning, I'm getting a lot better at it<>." Reuters
