Augusta: Tiger Woods's return to the US Masters may not be going as spectacularly as his army of supporters had hoped but the 14-time Major winner's comeback continued to make steady progress when the American squeaked in under the cut-line on Friday. After Woods tuned up for his first Augusta visit since 2015 with a pair of top-five finishes, expectations sky-rocketed for the 42-year-old, despite a recent spinal fusion operation that was described as nothing less than a surgical 'Hail Mary'. Those results, combined with a return to an iconic venue where he has collected 11 top-five finishes including four Green Jackets, had Las Vegas bookmakers installing Woods as one of the leading contenders. However, Woods' play through two rounds of the year's first Major has been more workmanlike than magical. "Six months ago I didn't know if I'd be playing golf," Woods told reporters. "Forget playing at the (PGA) Tour level, I didn't know if I'd ever be playing again. "But it's incredible to have the opportunity again, to still come out here and play on this golf course. Now I know I'm on the weekend."
