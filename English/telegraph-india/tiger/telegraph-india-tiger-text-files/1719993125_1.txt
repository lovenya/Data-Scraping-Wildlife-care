Even as the 2006 tiger census is being carried out all over India, two wildlife enthusiasts have made their own contribution to spreading awareness about the big cat. Trails of the Tiger, launched at the Crossword bookstore recently, is a wildlife guide and tourist brochure rolled into one. A collaborative effort by Sangita Mitra and Tanmay Chaudhury, the book showcases rare images of the tiger in its natural surroundings and tips on different aspects of jungle tourism. Chaudhury, a physician by profession, is a compulsive trekker and has romped across 15 Indian jungles visiting some of them eight times. With Mitra, a wildlife biologist and senior project officer of WWF-India, he wove his photographs with data and research material and created Trails of the Tiger. The book, published by Alchemy, focuses on six of India?s 27 tiger reserves. According to Mitra, Sariska is not the only tiger reserve in the red. ?It has been established that the number of tigers in Sariska is zero but Buxa and the Sunderbans, too, don?t have much to croon about. The difference is that when five tigers go missing from a total of seven or 10, it is more noticeable than five out of 125 or 150. ?Our book deals with the condition and area of the tiger habitats, which should be our major concern for conservation,? said Mitra. The book encourages people to take forest trips which may in the long run safeguard the tiger and other flora and fauna which don?t get as much attention and funds as the tiger. ?Today the second most lucrative trade after narcotics is the trade in animal body parts books like these may sensitise more people to the ills,? said Mitra.
