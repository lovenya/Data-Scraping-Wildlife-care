Rakul Preet Singh, Sanya Malhotra and Malaika Arora were among the Bollywood stars who celebrated International Dance Day on April 29 by sharing clips of them grooving to hit tracks. Rakul, who recently tied the knot with actor-producer Jackky Bhagnani in Goa, shared a video that shows her performing to a remix of Geeta Dutt’s 1967 track Meraa Naama Chin Chin Chu during an award ceremony. The montage also shows her performing the hook step of Tanishk Bagchi’s 2022 song Mashooka. One of the clips shows Jackky joining Rakul for the hook step. “I hope you always dance to the music in your life and enjoy every moment of it,” the Doctor G actress captioned her video on Instagram. Sanya shared a series of videos on her Instagram stories that show her grooving to her favourite tracks including Bawre, Kinni Kinni and Dhakad. Sanya also shared a throwback video that shows her performing with her Sam Bahadur co-stars Fatima Sana Shaikh and Vicky Kaushal at an event. “Iss World Dance Day par kuch dance throwback ho jaye (Let’s indulge in some dance throwback on this World Dance Day),” Sanya wrote on Instagram. While Malaika shared a clip from the Chaiyya Chaiyya music video featuring her and Shah Rukh Khan, Keerthy Suresh dropped stills flaunting her electrifying moves, set to Sushin Shyam’s 2024 track Illuminati. “Grooving every day but today is apparently #internationaldanceday,” Keerthy captioned her pictures on Instagram. Tiger Shroff, who recently starred alongside Akshay Kumar in Ali Abbas Zafar’s latest actioner Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, took to social media to mark the occasion of International Dance Day. Interestingly, Tiger did not share a clip of himself dancing to chartbusters. Instead, he posted a video showcasing his exceptional football skills as he smashed All Stars Football Club’s previous records with four consecutive goals.
