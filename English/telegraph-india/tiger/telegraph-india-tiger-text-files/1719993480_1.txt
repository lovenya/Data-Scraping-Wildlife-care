New York: Don't count on Jack Nicklaus watching any of Tiger Woods's comeback Tour. Woods made his much-anticipated return to golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in November, where the 14-time Major champion played his first tournament in nearly a year. Despite dealing with multiple injuries and off-the-course scandals, Woods looked better than he has on prior comebacks, finishing tied for ninth at 4-under par. His return was met with buzz from both fans and fellow tour pros. Just exclude Jack Nicklaus from from that list of fans and professionals. "I'm not interested at all," Nicklaus said about Woods' return. "Do I wish [Tiger] well? Yeah, but I'm not interested in watching him. I've watched him play golf for 20-something years, why would I want to go watch more?"
