Baaghi actor Tiger Shroff says working with his “idol” Hrithik Roshan is a dream-come-true moment for him and he will put in all the hard work needed to match up to the superstar. Backed by Yash Raj Films, the upcoming untitled movie featuring the duo will be helmed by Siddharth Anand, who has worked with Hrithik in Bang Bang. “I am most excited about working with him (Hrithik). I am so thankful that I got such an offer so early in my life. He is my idol. Whatever I am today it is because of what I saw of him while growing up,” Tiger said. The action film, also starring Vaani Kapoor, is slated for release on December 25, 2019. “I will have to prepare a lot. He (Hrithik) is a very hard-working actor. So if he gives 100 per cent, I will have to give my 200-300 per cent to match up to him. But I know I would never be able to match up to him,” he said. Tiger will also be seen in Student of the Year 2, produced by Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions. There were reports that Chunkey Pandey’s daughter, Ananya, would be making her Bollywood debut with the film. Asked about it, Tiger said: “I have no idea about any of the cast members yet.”
