Colombo, Dec. 14 (Reuters): The Tamil Tigersâ€™ chief negotiator and ideologue Anton Balasingham, who marshalled the rebels through successive rounds of abortive peace talks with the Sri Lankan state, has died of cancer in London, the rebels said today. He was 68. Balasingham was a trusted confidant of rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, wrote his speeches and oversaw rebel negotiations that clinched a 2002 ceasefire.
