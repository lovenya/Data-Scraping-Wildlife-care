New Delhi, Mar 28 (PTI): The tiger population in the  country has risen to 1,706 in 2010 from 1,411 in 2006, the  latest Tiger Census released today said, thanks to sustained  conservation efforts.
                    
                    The census, which was the most comprehensive and  scientifically conducted exercise so far, used cameras  installed at strategic points like water bodies in forests, as  also in respective territories of big cats.
                    
                    Computers were used to analyse and collate the data.
                    
                    The 2006 Census had shown a sharp fall in the number  of tigers in ?protected areas? - reserves, national parks and  wildlife sanctuaries - in 19 states across the country.
