Bigg Boss is returning for Season 16 on Colors TV with Salman Khan as the host — but with a twist. Over the years, Salman, who has been hosting the show since 2010, watched the participants play the game. But in the latest edition of Bigg Boss, the Bollywood star is set to actively participate in the game. In a recently shot promo for Bigg Boss, Salman, looking dapper in a black jacket, promises to turn the game on its head, instantly upping the stakes for Season 16. Giving a glimpse of the past participants and Bigg Boss winners, the promo focuses on Salman, who is then heard saying that everyone has so far watched the participants play the game, but Big Boss himself will play the game in Bigg Boss Season 16. On Sunday, Colors TV shared this promo on its Instagram with the caption, “Inn 15 saalon mein sabne khela apna apna game, lekin ab baari hai Bigg Boss ke khelne ki.” The names of the new contestants and the launch date of Bigg Boss Season 16 are yet to be announced. Based on the Dutch reality show Big Brother, the first season of Bigg Boss was aired in 2006 on Sony TV with Arshad Warsi as the host. In the second season, Shilpa Shetty replaced Arshad, only to be replaced by Amitabh Bachchan in the third season. Since then, Salman has been hosting the show, contributing to its popularity among fans.
