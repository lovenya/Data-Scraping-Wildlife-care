Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff set the dance floor on fire with their killer moves and palpable bromance in the music video of their upcoming film Bade Miyan Chote Miyan’s title track, dropped by Zee Music Company on Monday. Shot at Jerash, Abu Dhabi, the two-minute-49-second-long music video begins with Akshay’s ‘Bade Miyan’ and Tiger’s ‘Chote Miyan’ entering the scene in green outfits and bumping their fists before flaunting their casual dance steps. Both Akshay and Tiger lip-sync to the song which expresses their on-screen bromance while dancing in a public square and enjoying their time at a beach. While Tiger flaunts his ripped body and abs after a surfing session, Akshay brings out his fun-loving side as he plays frisbee with bikini-clad girls at a beach. “The hookline of the song 'Tere piche tera yaar khada' is one of the catchiest melodies, leaving a lasting impression on music lovers,” producer Jackky Bhagnani said in a statement. “Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is a visual spectacle that will enthrall the masses and the youth. Vishal Mishra has added a unique sound that is fresh and builds on the premise of Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff dancing to a foot tapping number,” he added. The song is choreographed by Bosco-Caesar and sung by Anirudh Ravichander and Vishal Mishra. It is penned by Irshad Kamil and composed by Vishal Mishra. Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is written and directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. Produced by Vashu Bhagnani, Deepshikha Deshmukh, Jackky Bhagnani, Himanshu Kishan Mehraa and Zafar, the film is slated to release on Eid this year.
