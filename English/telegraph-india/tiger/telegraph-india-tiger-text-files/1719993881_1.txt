The Sunderbans tiger that was operated on at Alipore zoo on Tuesday for the removal of a mass from its front right knee is showing signs of aggression, which doctors said is proof that the big cat was recovering. “It is roaming freely in a cage. It is quite aggressive and also roaring,” zoo director Ashish Kumar Samanta said on Tuesday. “Aggression is natural for a big cat. It means the animal is recovering. Had it still been idle and drowsy, the zoo vets should have been worried,” a vet said. The tiger will be under observation for a few more weeks, after which the authorities will decide whether it can be released in the wild. The adult male has been kept inside a 12ftx14ft cage, said Rudradeb Mukherjee, the deputy-director of the animal resource development department. Mukherjee headed the team that removed the fibroid mass. The tiger is on a diet comprising mostly chicken and chicken soup. Around 3kg-4kg of meat is being provided daily, Samanta said. Beef and mutton will be added to the menu later. The tiger is eating twice, at 9am and 5pm. The tiger was limping when it was captured from a village in Kultali, in the Sunderbans, in December.
