The Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Jharkhand needs tigresses if it has to keep the three male migrant tigers that have been spotted in recent months, the tiger reserve authorities feel. According to a tiger census conducted in 2018, the PTR did not have a single tiger and it hadn't even recorded any significant presence of the big cat since then. However, currently, it is hosting three visiting tigers, all male, who might stay put if they found mates within the reserve. The PTR authorities are seriously considering about approaching the National Tiger Conservation Authority for approving translocation of tigresses from other reserves where they may be in excess number. "Three tigers are now roaming within core and buffer areas of PTR and all of them are migrant males," PTR deputy director Kumar Ashish confirmed when contacted, adding they were sure about it as they have photos captured by camera traps and other evidence such as pug marks. Tigers are known for moving to distant places in search of suitable habitat, adequate food and prospective mates. The three migrant tigers must have liked the habitat in Palamau and are also getting adequate food as one of those tigers has been staying here since March this year and the other two for the past two months, the PTR deputy director pointed out. "But we are not sure if they would stay put here if they don't find mates for a long time," he further said.
