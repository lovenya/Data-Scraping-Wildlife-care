Guwahati, Sept. 21: WWF India will begin its tiger estimation effort in the picturesque Tale wildlife sanctuary of Arunachal Pradesh with camera traps in the first week of October. The area in the Nameri-Pakke landscape has the largest tiger population in Arunachal Pradesh, said the 2010 report on Status of the Tiger, Co-Predators and Prey, released recently. “The habitat is good and the place has potential of holding tigers,” Jimmy Borah, assistant coordinator of Tiger programme, WWF India, said. The Pakke-Nameri landscape includes parts of Sessa orchid sanctuary in West  Kameng district, Eagle’s Nest wildlife  sanctuary, Pakke tiger reserve, parts  of Nameri tiger reserve in Assam and  continues via the forests of Tale valley into lower Subansiri to Daying Ering wildlife sanctuary in East Siang and upto Namdapha tiger reserve. The tiger population of Pakke is estimated at nine. Borah said around 25-30 camera traps would be laid down in the wildlife sanctuary. The fresh survey comes after the 2010 report stated that the current distribution of tigers in Arunachal Pradesh is a reflection of the limited survey effort. The state forest department has also given the green signal to WWF India for tiger estimation. Interestingly, parts of Tale wildlife  sanctuary will be submerged once the  Lower Subansiri hydroelectric project is functional.
