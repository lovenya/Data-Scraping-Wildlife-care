A suspected poacher was killed in a gunfight with forest guards in the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve on Saturday, the first since 2017. The park authorities said in a statement that a patrolling party stationed near Erasuti Anti Poaching Camp under Agaratoli Range “intercepted few unknown persons on foot” in the early morning hours of Saturday and “when challenged a fierce gun battle broke out on both sides” around 3am. “At first light, around 5am, the forest guards searched the area and the body of the poacher was recovered,” the statement said. A suspected modified .303 rifle and live ammunition were also recovered from the deceased who is yet to be identified. The national park authorities had strengthened their patrolling and surveillance activities along its boundary following reports about “alleged intruders trying to enter the park”. “At present, the entire area is being combed to trace out any further evidence with the help of Assam police,” the statement said. An official told The Telegraph that the last poacher killed in the tiger reserve was in 2017. Between 2013 and 2016, as many as 55 poachers were killed in the forest popular for its one-horned rhinos.
