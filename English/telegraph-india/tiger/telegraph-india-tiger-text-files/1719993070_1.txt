Five hours. 3.2 million views. #TigerZindaHaiTrailer trending at No. 1 on Twitter India. No one is surprised though. We have come to expect such responses for a big film starring Salman Khan. The most anticipated trailer of the month is just over three minutes long and packed with big guns, lots of ratatatatat and Salman Khan’s biceps and a bit of distraction in the form of Katrina Kaif. When 25 Indian nurses are kidnapped by a terrorist organisation in Iraq, it will take a Tiger to rescue them. Looking like a million bucks in this visual treat that claims to be inspired by true events, the trailer, predictably, is all about Salman. A few catchy dialogues add to the excitement. “Shikaar to sab karte hain. Lekin Tiger se behtar shikaar koi nahi karta,” in Salman’s signature drawl is bound to inspire ceetees. Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, Tiger Zinda Hai releases on December 22.
