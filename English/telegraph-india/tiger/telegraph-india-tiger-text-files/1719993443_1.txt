As Tiger Zinda Hai — 2017’s highest grossing Hindi film — becomes Salman Khan’s biggest hit, the superstar wished 2018 will script more successes for the Hindi film industry. The film’s total collection now stands at a towering Rs 325.71 crore in India, setting cash counters ringing. 

On the incredible feat, Salman said: “It is important that we see more hits, more blockbusters. It will expand our industry, provide more jobs for people and entertain audiences much more. I’m happy with the business that Tiger Zinda Hai has been doing at the box office. “Records are never ever-lasting. Records are meant to be broken and it’s good for new records to happen more frequently. It is healthy and extremely important,” he added. Tiger Zinda Hai is Salman’s third film to hit Rs 300-crore mark after Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Sultan — the most by any actor. It is also the second YRF production to attain this feat — the maximum by any production house — after Sultan and director Ali Abbas Zafar’s second film in the Rs 300-crore club, the maximum by any filmmaker to date. 

His first? You guessed it right, Sultan.
