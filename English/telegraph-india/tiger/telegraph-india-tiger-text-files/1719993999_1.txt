Dubai: Tiger Woods was just one stroke behind the Dubai Desert Classic third-round leaders, on Saturday, after a topsy-turvy, even-par 72 in gusting winds left him firmly in contention to end a 14-month wait for victory. Dane Anders Hansen (71), South African Thomas Aiken (74) and Briton Rory McIlroy (75) led the way on eight-under 208, with 14-times major winner Woods one of seven players on 209. World No. 1 Lee Westwood (72) was back on 211. Woods stumbled to the turn in 39, mixing one birdie with three bogeys and a double-bogey six at the ninth. The twice former Dubai champion, though, re-ignited his title charge by storming back in 33 with three birdies, one eagle and a single dropped stroke. “It was a tough day but if I got even-par I figured that would be a good goal,” world No. 3 Woods said. “I’m only one back, still right there in the ball game.” The 35-year-old American shares fourth place with Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Gonnet (72), Australia’s Brett Rumford (72), Swede Fredrik Andersson Hed (69) and Spanish trio Alvaro Quiros (68), Sergio Garcia (75) and Alvaro Velasco (65). McIlroy, who led on his own after the opening two rounds, made a woeful start with four bogeys in seven holes. He also dropped a stroke at the 11th but birdies at the ninth and 12th meant the 21-year-old from Northern Ireland was well placed in his bid to record a second Dubai Classic triumph. “I got off to a rough start but I thought I steadied the ship really well,” said 2009 champion McIlroy. “I played the last 11 holes in one under which was actually pretty good. It’s now going to be a test of patience and about trying to play smart golf and make pars...” Among the Indians, while Jeev Milkha Singh stood at tied 26th, while Shiv Kapur was far behind at tied 78th.
