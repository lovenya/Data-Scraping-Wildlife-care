Additional principal chief conservator of forests (territorial, Upper Assam zone) S.K. Srivastava and a member of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Kalam Azad, on Friday arrived in Jorhat from Guwahati to conduct separate inquiries into the incident of killing and partial mutilation of a female adult Royal Bengal tiger on Thursday on the outskirts here. The big cat, believed to have strayed from Kaziranga National Park, was lynched by a mob after the wild animal attacked three persons at Baghmora Mising village at Karen Sapori - about 18km northwest from Jorhat. The tiger is believed to have moved along the Brahmaputra and its sandbars a few days back and may have reached the area. Kaziranga is about 70km west of Jorhat. The tail and a part of one of the forelegs and a hindleg too were cut by some in the mob. Few even attempted to skin the tiger from the backside, but the carcass was taken into custody by the forest staff. Divisional forest officer (Jorhat) Sapan Saikia said Srivasatava and Kalam visited the village separately to get first-hand knowledge of the incident. The DFO said the carcass, after post-mortem at the district veterinary hospital, was cremated according to NCTA guidelines (in UB Photos picture above). Saikia said a case has been registered under Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act at Pulibor police station after the forest department lodged an FIR. He said an investigation will be conducted by police with support from the forest department. The DFO said video footage, if any, of the attack on the tiger - an endangered animal - will be sought and if evidence was found, action will be taken against those involved. A police official said five persons, who led the attack, have been identified and action will be taken against them. Three persons injured in the attack by the tiger are undergoing treatment at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital. Text by our Jorhat correspondent
