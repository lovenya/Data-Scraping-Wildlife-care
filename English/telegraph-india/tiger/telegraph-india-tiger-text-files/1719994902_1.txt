Microblogging app Koo has raised $30 million, or Rs 218 crore, in Series B funding, led by Tiger Global. Existing investors Accel Partners, Kalaari Capital, Blume Ventures and Dream Incubator also took part in the latest round of fund-raising, a statement from the Twitter rival said on Wednesday. IIFL and Mirae Assets are the other new investors who came on board in the new round. The announcement comes just two days after the Delhi police visited the offices of Twitter India in Delhi and Gurgaon, after the latter labelled as “manipulated media” a post by BJP leader Sambit Patra with regard to an alleged toolkit by the Congress party on Covid. It also comes amid new IT intermediary rules taking effect, translating into greater accountability and scrutiny for social media companies, including Twitter and Facebook. Koo has around 60 lakh users. Last week, Koo had said that it has complied with the requirements of the new rules and its privacy policy, terms of use and community guidelines now reflect the changes. The fresh round of funding would be used mainly to strengthen engineering, product and community efforts across all Indian languages at Koo. “We have aggressive plans to grow into one of the world’s largest social media platforms in the next few years. Every Indian is cheering for us to get there soon…Tiger Global is the right partner to have on board to realise this dream,” Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder and CEO of Koo, said. Koo was founded by serial entrepreneurs Aprameya Radhakrishna, founder of TaxiForSure, and Mayank Bidawatka, who previously founded companies like MediaAnt and Goodbox. It has seen a massive growth in its user base over the past few months after Union ministers and government departments endorsed the homegrown microblogging platform, following a spat with Twitter. While Tiger Global’s well known investments include Flipkart, Ola, Razorpay, it has also backed ShareChat, Gupshup and fintech app Cred among others.
