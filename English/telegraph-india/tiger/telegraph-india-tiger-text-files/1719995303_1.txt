Tiger Shroff isn't the only fitness enthusiast in his family. The actor, who turns 33 today, runs one of India’s biggest Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) platform Matrix Fight Night in partnership with his mother Ayesha Shroff and younger sister Krishna Shroff — two other fitness entrepreneurs from the Shroff family. The trio’s gym in Mumbai is frequented by Bollywood stars like Disha Patani, Ayushmann Khurrana and Manushi Chillar. Tiger and Krishna are often seen working out together in their gym, and the latter stands toe to toe with her combat-trained brother. The Heropanti star is a trained martial artist whose inspiration comes from none other than Bruce Lee. Mid-air splits, backflips and high-kicks come easy to the Baaghi actor who enjoys immense popularity for his ripped physique and killer agility. Besides pulling off awe-inspiring dance moves, Tiger also enjoys playing football —a passion he wanted to pursue as a profession before starting his acting career in Indian cinema. Thirty-year-old Krishna is just as much of a fitness enthusiast as Tiger. She is a force to reckon with in the Octagon. Krishna packs a punch in the MMA ring and her submission holds are hard to break. The brother-sister duo recently attended the Matrix Fight Night 10 together along with their mother Ayesha. Krishna credits her brother and their father Jackie Shroff for her love towards fitness. While Tiger was her inspiration behind taking up intense fitness, Jackie encouraged the siblings to follow a healthy and organic diet as they grew up. Krishna also shares a healthy friendship with Tiger's rumoured ex-girlfriend Disha Patani. Both women share a love for fitness and are seen enjoying lunches together. Meanwhile, Tiger fans took to social media to shower wishes on the actor with #NoOneLikeTiger. Tiger has Ganapath - Part 1 and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan lined up for release this year.
