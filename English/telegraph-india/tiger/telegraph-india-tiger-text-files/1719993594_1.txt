Baripada, June 2: Authorities of the Similipal Tiger Reserve have set up an eco-tourism complex at Kumari near Gugudia in the Karanjia forest division to attract more tourists. This will be the third complex in the Similipal sanctuary area. Two more are already operating at Jamubani and Gudugudia. It consists of six bamboo cottages and a small restaurant. "This initiative will reduce the anthropogenic pressure on nature and man-animal conflict." said Ajit Satpathy, deputy director of the STR. "Kumari will be the third eco-tourism project in the sanctuary area. Efforts are on to explore more sites where such complexes can be built. This would not only provide livelihood to the local tribal population but also generate revenue for the department by attracting more eco-tourism enthusiasts," Satpathy said. The project is being executed by the wildlife department and jointly financed by Mayurbhanj district administration and Indian Grameen Services (IGS), a national-level organisation that promotes sustainable livelihoods across the country. The complex has been built at cost of Rs 35 lakh. "The primary objective is to create an alternative livelihood opportunities for the local community through eco-tourism so that their dependence on forest would be reduced over the period," said Karanjia divisional forest officer Asish Behera. The organisation is working at four blocks in Similipal to create livelihood opportunities for the local population and ensure restoration of the forest's biodiversity and its ecosystem. "The cottages have been built with the help of artistes and experts from tribal communities of Assam and Nagpur. The local residents have been trained in hospitality and guiding the tourists," said IGS assistant vice-president Sanjiv Sarangi. Forest produces such as bamboos have been used to set up the cottages.
