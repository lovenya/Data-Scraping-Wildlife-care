Tiger Woods will not participate in next month’s US Open at the Los Angeles Country Club as he continues to recover from devastating leg injuries from a February 2021 car crash. Woods, 47, had been exempt for the third major of the year, set to take place from June 15 to 18. He was in the fifth and final year of a US Open exemption that came from winning the 2019 Augusta Masters. He did not play in the 2021 or 2022 US Opens. Woods made the cut at this year’s Masters, but withdrew during the third round. A 15-time major winner, Woods won the US Open in 2000, 2002 and 2008. Woods has played in 22 US Opens from 1995-2020, and the legendary golfer has secured eight top-10 finishes in those appearances, including the three victories. A total of 33 players earned qualification status for the meet as determined by various standards at the completion of the PGA Championship over the weekend. Of those 33, eight already had earned exemptions into the tournament. Five others qualified via their spots on the FedEx Cup points list, the 2022 DP World Tour Finals Points List and the Race to Dubai rankings. More spots still are to be determined.
