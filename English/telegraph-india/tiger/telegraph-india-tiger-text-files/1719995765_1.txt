A jet of soft drinks splashes Akshay Kumar’s face and makes him splutter in an April Fool’s video shared by his Bade Miyan Chote Miyan co-star Tiger Shroff on Monday. The video begins with Tiger fiddling with a bottle of soft drinks and keeping it aside before he joins others to play volleyball on the Bade Miyan Chote Miyan set. A few moments later, Akshay jogs back to the garden to join the team. Tiger requests Akshay to pass the bottle, casually asking him to open the bottle for him. Just as Akshay opens the bottle, a jet of liquid shoots up and hits his face, making him splutter, which prompts Tiger and his teammates to burst out in laughter with Mohammed Rafi’s April Fool Banaya song in the background. “April bade miya ,” Tiger captioned the video shared on Instagram. Written and directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan features Akshay and Tiger as loyal Indian soldiers, who are determined to protect their country from threats of any kind. The upcoming Hindi-language action comedy thriller also features Prithviraj Sukumaran, Sonakshi Sinha, Manushi Chhillar and Alaya F in pivotal roles. Produced by Pooja Entertainment and AAZ Films, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is a remake of David Dhawan-helmed 1998 film starring Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda. It is slated to hit the theatres on April 10 on the occasion of Eid. Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff will be next seen together in Rohit Shetty’s upcoming Hindi-language action film Singham Again, also starring Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Arjun Kapoor and Jackie Shroff.
