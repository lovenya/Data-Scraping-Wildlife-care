Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff-starrer Bade Miyan Chote Miyan began its box office journey by raking in more than double of the collections of Ajay Devgn’s Maidaan. According to Sacnilk, the action- thriller directed by Ali Abbas Zafar raked in Rs 15.5 crore nett across all languages in India on its opening day, while Amit Sharma’s sports drama could only earn Rs 7.1 crore nett (including Rs 2.6 crore nett from paid previews). Bade Miyan Chote Miyan has also emerged as the second-biggest opener of the year, with Hrithik Roshan's Fighter occupying the top spot with a staggering Rs 24.6 crore nett collection on its opening day. The action comedy beat the opening-day earnings of Ajay Devgn's Shaitaan, which pulled in Rs 15.21 crore nett, by a whisker. Apart from Fighter, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan and Shaitaan, only Crew (Rs 8.75 crore nett) has collections higher than Devgn’s sports drama on opening day. Alongside Akshay and Tiger, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan boasts an ensemble cast including Prithviraj Sukumaran, Sonakshi Sinha, Manushi Chillar and Alaya F. Produced by Vashu Bhagnani and Jackky Bhagnani, the film derives its title from the 1998 comedy featuring Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda. Despite being bested by Bade Miyan Chote Miyan on the opening day, Maidaan also managed to earn a spot among the top five Hindi openers of 2024. It is a biopic of former Indian football coach Syed Abdul Rahim and depicts the golden era of Indian football between 1952 and 1962.
