Norton: Tiger Woods was in upbeat mood despite being deposed as world No. 1 by Fiji’s Vijai Singh on Monday. Singh took over top spot in the rankings by winning the Deutsche Bank Championship while Woods had to settle for joint second place, three strokes adrift, alongside defending champion Adam Scott of Australia. Woods, though, found solace in his ball striking at the Tournament Players Club of Boston. “I think it’s just exciting to finally put the pieces together in my golf swing,” Woods said. “All summer long, I’ve been slowly but surely putting them together, and this week was the culmination of it all. “I really hit it good this week and didn’t quite make all of the putts, made a few bad shots here and there, but nothing like (last month’s) NEC Invitational (in Akron, Ohio) where I hit it off the planet.”
