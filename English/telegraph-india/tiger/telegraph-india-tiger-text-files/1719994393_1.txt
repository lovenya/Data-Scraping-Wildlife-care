Sourish Misra: Why do you discourage collection of tiger prawn seedlings from the Sunderbans area? We do so because the practice causes a tremendous loss of fish resources and permanent damage to the aquatic biodiversity of the Sunderbans, which has been declared a global biosphere reserve. Due to collection of a single prawn seedling, locally known as meen, at least 78 seedlings of a variety of fishes are destroyed. We are trying to offer local residents alternative sources of livelihood.
