The Shroff father and son — Jackie and Tiger — make their maiden appearance on Koffee with Karan this Sunday. From revealing family secrets to some career confessions, the two — poles apart in talk and temperament — are set to make it an interesting episode. Before you tune in (Sunday, 9pm on STAR World and STAR World HD), t2 gets you a sneak peek. EYE ON THE BALL Tiger Shroff is known to be super fit and so host Karan Johar coaxes the young gun into revealing the secret behind his disciplined life. Tiger says that not only does he maintain a very strict diet — no smoking and no drinking — he also adheres to a very disciplined schedule to manage his fitness. So, bedtime for him is as early as 10pm and he’s up at 6 every morning to train! TIGER’S PICK-ME-UP: ICE CREAM! But does that mean Shroff Jr. doesn’t have his weaknesses? Confessing that the failure of his third film A Flying Jatt left him feeling “very low”, Tiger turned to an instant pick-me-up. An “emotional eater”, he says that he ate crazy amounts of ice cream to comfort himself. We feel you, boy! JACKIE’S JOURNEY Jackie Shroff’s ‘bidu’ origins are well known. But did you know that the actor tried out quite a few careers before he turned to Bollywood? From unsuccessfully trying to intern with an airline to trying his hand at becoming a chef with the Taj — Jaggu Dada has had a chequered career-graph.  His luck turned when he was discovered at a bus stop by a model coordinator — and then there was no looking back! DADDY DEAREST Always a hands-on father, Jackie revealed on Koffee that he made it a point to be with his children Tiger and Krishna at the end of a long day of shoot. So if he was shooting in India, the doting dad made sure he flew home every night by the last flight to put his kids to bed, before leaving for the shoot early next morning!
