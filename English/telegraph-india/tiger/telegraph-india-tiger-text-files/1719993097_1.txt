Augusta: Tiger Woods took charge of the 69th US Masters on Sunday, a record-equalling run of seven birdies helping him to a three-shot lead when the weather-delayed third round was finally completed. The three-time champion, bidding to end a run of 10 majors without victory, fired a seven-under-par 65 to finish on 11-under 205 in bright sunshine at Augusta National. Although he dropped two shots in his last five holes in calm early morning conditions, the 29-year-old American overhauled overnight leader Chris DiMarco, who battled to a 74 and outright second place at eight under. DiMarco, four strokes clear of Woods on 13 under at the start of the day, fell away on the back nine after running up a double-bogey at the par-four 10th. Denmark?s Thomas Bjorn, after a 71, was a further stroke back in third with defending champion Phil Mickelson, who carded a 69, tied for fourth at five under with South African Trevor Immelman (65). Woods, chasing his first major victory since the 2002 US Open, began the day in rampant form and drew level with DiMarco after setting up birdies on 10 and 11.. DiMarco meanwhile slipped back with his early stumble on 10. It was DiMarco?s first blemish since he bogeyed his first hole of the tournament. While Woods dominated the top of the leaderboard, 2004 champion Mickelson also made an early move. Ten strokes off the overnight lead at three under par, the left-handed American  birdied the 12th, his first hole of the day, the 13th and the 15th before slipping back with a bogey at the last. Back on track after three days of weather disruptions, the first of the year?s four major championships was poised for a thrilling finish.
