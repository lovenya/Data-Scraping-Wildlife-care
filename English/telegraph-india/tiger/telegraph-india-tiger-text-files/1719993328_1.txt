Newport: Terry Matthews is convinced he will be playing host to Tiger Woods when the Ryder Cup is staged at his Celtic Manor golf resort in Wales in October. Woods has yet to commit himself to the American team, let alone qualify for it. So far, sources at Celtic Manor do not believe the European Tour has received any special requests to house the large entourage of advisors and security staff that accompany Woods on any trip overseas. But Matthews, the owner and chairman of the resort, said: “There is no doubt about it, Tiger is going to be here. “The US PGA will make him come here. They need him here. The PGA will want to have their strongest at the Ryder Cup, and in my opinion Tiger Woods, as the world’s No 1 has got to be part of that strongest team.” Meanwhile, in Ireland there is increasing speculation that Woods will visit Limerick in July to play his first round outside of the US this year. In 2009, Woods promised Irish racehorse trainer JP McManus that he would appear at a two-day charity pro-am at Adare Manor on July 6-7 as part of his warm-up to the British Open.
