Augusta: The script was all about whether Rory McIlroy could achieve golfing immortality, not whether Tiger Woods could avoid golfing ignominy. But with six short words, the latter changed all that on Friday night - "I'm going to play the Masters". Of course, on hearing the news and sampling the burgeoning hype there will doubtless be those whose eyeballs will roll. Yet any claim that the 39-year-old is irrelevant to the season's first major is quite frankly ridiculousness. Irrelevant, eh? Tell that to the ticket tours who, come Saturday morning, were suddenly seeing season tickets being sold for $1,500 more than the day previous. Tell that to the fans paying those daft prices for a trip inside golf's nearest thing to heaven, which will now be graced by one of the game's undoubted Gods. Tell that to the sponsors, to the game's denizens, who are so desperate to pull in as many viewers as possible and stem the supposed exodus to cycling. But, most of all, tell it to McIlroy. Tell the world No 1, the Northern Irishman on a Masters mission to become just the sixth player in history to win the career Grand Slam, that it does not matter if Woods plays or not. He would laugh so hard a few azalea heads would fall off. For McIlroy it matters. It will not be all on him now. The lenses, at least for the first few days, will be trained elsewhere. No, McIlroy will not be able "fly under the radar", but at least with all the hoopla going on around him he will not be trying to stay tranquil like an air traffic controller in holiday season.
