Calcutta, Nov. 21: A tiger  dragged a fisherman looking for catch in the shallows of the Matla into the Sunderbans  last evening. Fellow fishermen, who chased the tiger, found Mangal Naiya’s body in the forest about half an hour later. “The tiger had bitten off half his face and the eyes were gone,” divisional forest officer Kalyan Das said. Six people, including Mangal’s mother, were in waist-deep water with hand nets when Mangal, who was nearer to the bank, cried for help. The tiger had grabbed him by the neck when he stooped to search for crabs. Mangal, 20, is the fifth person killed by a Sunderbans tiger in the past six months. The body of the last victim could not be traced in September.
