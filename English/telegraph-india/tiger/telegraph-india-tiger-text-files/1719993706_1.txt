Oakmont: Perhaps the most famous photo of Jack Nicklaus as a father came from the 1973 US PGA Championship. He had just completed a 68 in the second round at Canterbury when four-year-old Gary, the fourth of his five children, ran onto the green and into his arms. Nicklaus walked off the 18th green clutching his son with one hand and his putter with the other. Two days later, he won the US PGA to break the record for most majors. Don’t expect that to happen to Tiger Woods. Fatherhood won’t stop or even slow his pursuit of Nicklaus’ 18 professional majors. Woods already has shown that life-changing moments, such as marriage or the death of his father, haven’t changed a thing about his dominance in the game. Far more difficult to imagine is a warm and fuzzy photo of his family in public. Woods became a father on Monday in Orlando when his wife, Elin, gave birth to a daughter they named Sam Alexis Woods. The news was announced on his website, leaving out such details as height and weight and when she was born. The big question is when anyone will see this child in public. Woods can rarely go anywhere at a golf tournament without getting pounded by the press and the public, and sometimes his peers. He draws such a clear line between private and public that Woods won’t reveal his schedule until a week before a given tournament. He doesn’t let anyone except his friends inside his home, even before he got married. The name of his yacht says it all — ‘Privacy.’ Ditto for his wife, who will walk away when she sees a group of photographers pointing cameras at her. The only time Elin was a prominent part of the picture was last summer at Hoylake, and only because Woods was a blubbering mess of tears having captured his first victory since the death of his father. Woods is so protective of his private life, it is difficult to imagine him allowing his child to be at a tournament lest they feel part of the circus. That’s something Nicklaus never faced. His stardom came during the era of Sports Illustrated, not People magazine. Nicklaus had to cope with Palmer, Trevino and Watson. Woods has Nikon, Canon and Kodak.                                             (AP)
