New York, April 4: A scandal-plagued Tiger Woods faces the risk of further embarrassment during the tournament at the elite Augusta club as tabloid magazines and gossip websites are offering six-figure sums for new exposes. “Tiger and his camp are desperate to get Elin (Nordegren) to attend the Masters, even if she just turns up for a kiss or a hug when he walks off the 18th green,” said Mike Paul, a leading public  relations and crisis management consultant who is in contact with Woods’ advisers. “They are doing everything they can to persuade her to attend but at the moment she’s not interested.” But there were signs this weekend that Elin might yet be swayed to stand by her man in public. Despite earlier  reports that she intended to stay in her native Sweden with the couple’s two young  children, she has just returned to the US. On Friday, she attended the Sony Ericsson Open tennis tournament with son Charlie. In a further uncomfortable twist for the golfer, a former kindergarten teacher told The New York Post she wanted an apology for his claim to have been racially assaulted by older children on his first day at school. “It never happened,” said Maureen Decker, 69, who was Woods’ teacher at the primary school in Anaheim, California. In accounts given to an author and during a television interview, Woods said he had been tied to a tree, spray-painted with a racially abusive word and had rocks thrown at him, adding, “and the teacher really didn’t do too much of anything”. Decker, now retired, said the attack could not have happened as older children could not enter the kindergarten area, adding that he was far from the only minority child in the class. The constant repetition of the story had affected her physically, she said, and she urged Woods to apologise to “all those he has hurt... and that includes me, his kindergarten teacher.”
