Colombo, May 13 (AFP): A top Norwegian envoy clinched an agreement today with Tamil Tiger rebels on reviving peace negotiations with the Sri Lankan government, the guerrillas said. The LTTE announced an end to the impasse over resuming peace talks after Norwegian deputy foreign minister Vidar Helgesen made an unscheduled visit to the rebel-held town of Kilinochchi today. The Tigers’ chief peace negotiator, Anton Balasingham, said in Kilinochchi, 330 km north of Colombo, that Oslo would announce the deal between the Tigers and the Colombo government. “There are some practical problems to be sorted out over when and where to hold the talks,” Balasingham said. “The Norwegian government will make an official announcement regarding the basic agreements we have reached regarding the resumption of the talks in a day or two.” However, Balasingham said there were still some issues where there had been no agreement, but declined to give details of his two-hour talks with Helgesen who stayed an extra day for the last-ditch attempt to jumpstart talks. Helgesen stayed back after Jan Petersen left yesterday after failing to secure an agreement on resuming negotiations which have been stalled since April last year.
