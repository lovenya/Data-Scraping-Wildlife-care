Colombo, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Sri Lanka’s navy said it destroyed two Tamil Tiger suicide boats that tried to ram a pair of freighters full of aid supplies today, while diplomatic pressure from India over its war appeared to cool. The rebels said they had sunk one of the ships, which they said was carrying military supplies, and inflicted heavy damage on the other. The military said one ship was slightly damaged. Also today, warnings surfaced from a group calling itself the Mahasohon Balakaya, or Ghost Force in the Sinhalese language, that lawyers defending Tamils accused in anti-terrorism cases would be killed. The letters were sent yesterday to human rights lawyers and court registrars, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission. Mahasohon Balakaya said it was defending the thousands of innocent people who had been killed by Tiger bombings. The latest LTTE suicide attack comes as Sri Lanka’s government is pressing an offensive it is confident will soon end the war. The navy said it fired on three LTTE boats that tried to ram the freighters Nimalawa and Ruhuna. Two rebel boats exploded, the third capsized and six Tigers were killed, the navy said.
