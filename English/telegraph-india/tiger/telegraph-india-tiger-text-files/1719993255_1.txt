Miami: Never mind about Tiger Woods’s back injury blighting this week’s challenge for an eighth WGC Cadillac Championship, the world No.1 is worried how it might affect his long-term future. Woods rarely is so candid when it comes to his fitness, so his fears must be viewed as very real indeed.  The 38-year-old pulled out of Sunday’s final round of the Honda Classic citing spasms in his lower back, a complaint he first suffered at the end of last season. “As I have aged, I don’t heal as fast as I used to, I don’t bounce back,” Woods said.  “You have just to take a more global look at it sometimes and take a step back. The will to win hasn’t changed — it’s physically, am I able to do it? A bad back is something that is no joke. “When I’ve had my injuries over the years, it always hurt like hell after impact. So it’s fine; the ball’s gone. I can do my job and deliver the club and deliver the final moment to the ball and hit the shot I want to hit. “But with the back, it’s a totally different deal. There are certain moments, certain movements you just can’t do,” Woods said.  His experience at PGA National was a painful reminder of this. “I just couldn’t twist,” he said. “I said this was absurd. I’m going to be hitting it 100 yards either way right now and I don’t know which one is coming. On the third I hit it 100 yards right and the sixth 50 yards left. It got to a point where I was probably doing more harm than good.” Woods, however, is thinking more about The Masters in five weeks time. “I’m constantly looking at that, looking at managing myself through there,” he said. “I want to be strong and healthy to try to win my fifth green jacket. We have looked at my scheduling and practice sessions and all that stuff and we have tried to come up with a good plan.”
