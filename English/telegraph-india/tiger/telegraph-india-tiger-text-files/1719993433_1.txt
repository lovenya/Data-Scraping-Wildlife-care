Tezpur, Aug. 3: Four days after a tiger entered the North Eastern Regional Institute of Water and Land Management campus at Dulabari, forest officials, experts from the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Wildlife Trust of India were able to tranquillise the animal today. The female tiger had strayed out of the flood-affected Kaziranga National Park into the Dulabari area. The tiger had attacked a 14-year-old, Mohibur Islam, on Tuesday morning. A resident of Dulabari village under Tezpur sadar police station, the boy was seriously injured and rushed to Tezpur Kanaklata civil hospital. Later, he was shifted to Tezpur Medical College Hospital for intensive care. The operation to tranquillise the tiger, led by western Assam wildlife division DFO R.B. Saikia, began yesterday but ran into a glitch. The experts could not spot the animal on the campus. Finally, the animal was tranquillised this morning after four attempts. The tiger, which crossed the Brahmaputra to escape from the floods, was injured in the process. The forest and police officials released the tiger at Nameri National Park late in the evening. A senior forest official told The Telegraph that a three-day training would be held from August 9 to 11 in Tezpur where employees of Kaziranga, Nameri, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park and Pakke tiger reserve and Namdhapa tiger reserve will participate.
