Lemont (US): Tiger Woods won the BMW Championship for his sixth victory of the year Sunday, assuring himself the No.1 ranking going into the final tournament of the FedEx Cup. One day after his course-record 62 gave him a seven-shot lead, Woods made sure no one else had a chance in the final round. He closed with a 3-under 68 for an eight-shot victory over Jim Furyk and Marc Leishman. Woods won for the fifth time at Cog Hill, and it was his 10th career victory by at least eight shots.“It felt like we had a tournament within a tournament,” Furyk said. “Tiger was seven ahead. He was kind of running away. It was kind of a tournament for second place.” That other tournament wound up being quite a show. As Woods cruised around Cog Hill in his familiar red shirt, a dozen players behind him were scrambling for positions into the FedEx Cup finale at East Lake in two weeks. Furyk’s runner-up finish moved him up 15 spots to No.3, meaning he can win the FedEx Cup with a victory at the Tour Championship. Leishman, who only qualified for Cog Hill by making an eagle on his last hole a week ago outside Boston, earned his first trip to the Tour Championship and will have an outside shot at the $10 million. Most compelling, however, was the battle for the 30th and final spot. The heartbreaker belonged to Brandt Snedeker, playing in the final group with Woods.                                                                               (AP)
