Nassau (Bahamas): The weekend was all about Tiger Woods's much-anticipated return to a course but it was Japanese Hideki Matsuyuma who clinched the 2016 Hero World Challenge Golf title here and immediately conceded that he was honoured to win a tournament hosted by the legendary golfer. Returning from a 15-month layoff, the longest of his illustrious career, Woods wrapped up his campaign with a four-over 76 at the Albany Golf Club and finished 15th in a 17-man field. British Open champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden eagled the par-five ninth on the way to a 68 and second place, three ahead of Americans Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matt Kuchar. Woods had rounds of 73, a stunning 65 on the second day, 70 and 76. The American had quite a few positives from the tournament and his back seemed to have held up well after undergoing two surgeries. "I am just so thankful to be back out here playing again," Woods told reporters. "I made some birdies this week, and I felt like I did really well in that regard but I also made some really silly mistakes. I played the par-fives, quite frankly, awful."
