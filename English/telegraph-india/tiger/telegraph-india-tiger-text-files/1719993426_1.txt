Bettiah: The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has stepped up its effort to integrate Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) with Patna as part of an ambitious plan. IWAI state director A.K. Mishra said efforts made in the past year have begun to assume shape now. "We have identified two locations, at Dumariya Ghat and at Narayanpur, for ship berthing platforms on the said waterway, now known as NW-40," Mishra said. "A final decision in this regard awaited." NW-40 is meant to integrate Valmikinagar with Gaighat in Patna, passing through Bagaha, Bettiah, Gopalganj, Chhapra and Vaishali for the purpose of inland water transport. Officials said the Centre has also cleared the deck for integration of Pathlahwa and Kushinagar under Sohagiwarwa wildlife sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh with NW-40 and sanctioned Rs 150.73 crore. The move is expected to boost tourism. Valmikinagar, which shares a border with Nepal, boasts of Nardevi and Jatashakar temples, apart from scenic views around. Located around 320km northwest of Patna, Valmikinagar isn't integrated with railways as yet and a visitor has to brave a road marred by potholes between Lauriya and Bagaha. Of late, the Bihar government has identified VTR among 50 locations to boost tourism in the district as part of the ongoing centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi's visit to Champaran and mooted a proposal to press in services of a 72-seater aircraft for one bound for Valmikinagar.
