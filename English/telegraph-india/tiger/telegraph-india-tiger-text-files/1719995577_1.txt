A wounded Kareena Kapoor Khan looks fearless and resilient as Avni Bajirao Singham in her character poster from Rohit Shetty’s upcoming cop universe offering Singham Again, starring Ajay Devgn as the titular hero. Dropped by the makers on Wednesday, the character poster shows Kareena’s Avni pointing a gun at the camera, with armed security personnel appearing in the background. The film also stars Ranveer Singh as Simmba and Deepika Padukone’s female cop as a new addition to Rohit Shetty’s film series. Sharing a poster on social media, Rohit wrote, “We first worked together in 2007… 3 blockbusters till now, And now working on our fourth project... Singham Again...16 year long association. Nothing has changed, Bebo is still the same, simple, sweet and hardworking.” Kareena re-posted Rohit Shetty’s post and wrote, “It’s about time…  Rejoining forces with the cop verse ” Singham Again is a sequel to the 2014 film Singham Returns. Alongside Ajay, Ranveer, and Deepika, the film features Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff. Singham Again is slated for a 2024 release.
