Bollywood star Salman Khan has suffered a shoulder injury on the sets of his upcoming spy thriller movie Tiger 3. On Thursday, Salman took to social media to share a picture of his bandaged up back.  “Wen u think u r carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders, he says duniya ko chodo paanch kilo ka dumbbell utha ke dikhao (Let the world be, try lifting a 5 kg dumbbell). Tiger Zakhmi Hai (Tiger is injured). #Tiger3,” the 57-year-old actor wrote alongside the photo. Instagram sensations and Bigg Boss 16 stars Kili Paul and Abdu Rozik commented below the photo. “Strong like steel,” Kili wrote, while Abdu wrote, “1 kg dumbbell bhai for me.” Tiger 3 marks the third film of the Tiger franchise in which Salman will return as the titular Indian spy alongside Katrina Kaif’s Pakistani spy Zoya. Shah Rukh Khan will make a guest appearance in the movie in his Pathaan avatar. Directed by Maneesh Sharma, Tiger 3 is scheduled to be released in November this year. Salman was last seen in the Farhad Samji-directorial Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan with Pooja Hegde and Venkatesh Daggubati.
