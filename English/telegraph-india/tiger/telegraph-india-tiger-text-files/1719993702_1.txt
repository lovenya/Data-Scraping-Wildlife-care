Norton: Inconsistent form once again cost Daniel Chopra dearly as he returned a second successive three-over 74 to finish a lowly tied 70th at the Deutsche Bank Championships here. The poor finish eliminated the Indian-born Swede from the Fedex Cup play-offs, which continue in Chicago next week. Chopra struck birdies on fourth, seventh and 17th, but dropped shots on fifth, ninth, 14th and 18th besides a double bogey on the 10th ruined his chances of a decent spot on the leaderboard. Meanwhile, Phil Mickelson pipped Tiger Woods (67) to the post with a five-under 66 to win the championship by two shots with a total of 16-under 268. It was his first victory since the Players Championship in may, after which a wrist injury cost him his summer. Mickelson, who returned to the second spot in world rankings with his 32nd career victory, took only 23 putts in the final round. Woods suffered on the greens and needed 32 for the day and tied for second with Arron Oberholser (69) and Brett Wetterich (70). Mickelson earned $1.26 million for his effort and is now on top of the standings in the PGA Tour play-offs for the Fedexcup.
