Pebble Beach: Tiger Woods ran off five birdies in a six-hole span to charge up the leaderboard at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Saturday. It was only enough to make up a little ground on Charlie Wi, who played bogey-free at Spyglass Hill for a 3-under 69 to build a three-shot lead as he searches for his first US PGA Tour win. Woods took another step toward showing his game is nearly back. His five birdies in a six-hole stretch early in his round helped him to a 5-under 67 that put him four shots behind going into the final day, the closest he has been to the 54-hole lead in a regular PGA Tour event since the 2010 Masters. With a new swing, it’s starting to look like the old Tiger. “But the scenario doesn’t change,” Woods, who is in third place, said. “The ultimate goal is to win a golf tournament.” That’s something Wi has never done in 162 previous PGA Tour events. Wi, who was at 15-under 199, has a 54-hole lead for only the second time on tour. He had a one-shot lead at Colonial last year and was runner-up to David Toms. This time, Wi will be in the last group with someone in a familiar spot. Ken Duke, who is winless in 142 starts on the PGA Tour, shot a 65 at Monterey Peninsula. Along with Woods, Phil Mickelson managed to stay in contention despite playing the par 5s at Pebble Beach in 1-over par. He saved par on the 18th for a 70. That put him in a tie for fourth, six shots behind, and set up a date with Woods in the second-to-last pairing. Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal’s misery ended with yet another poor round of 76. The score took his three-round total to 227 which meant he finished very close to the bottom of the leaderboard after missing his fifth cut in a row.                                (Agencies)
