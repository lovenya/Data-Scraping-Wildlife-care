DANIEL CRAIG, CHRIS MARTIN, JON BON JOVI, TIGER SHROFF You have a rare wit, without revealing all that you think, so friends and family enjoy being around you. You are considered a bit of a know-it-all and you are, perhaps, a little full of yourself. You tend to be easily irritated, therefore, you are most comfortable working alone. You dislike interference and will immediately speak up for justice. You are always confident that relationships will work out, so you are not easily upset. â€” Kusum Bhandari
