Carry your leech socks, waterproof shoes, a butterfly guidebook and a good camera as you venture out to Namdapha to spot butterflies. Namdapha national park in Arunachal Park, which is the largest protected area that falls under the eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, is a “dream destination for butterfly enthusiasts”. Thirty butterfly enthusiasts from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Bengal, Sikkim, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are participating in the sixth edition of the Northeast Butterfly Meet, which will be flagged off by a senior official of Namdapha tiger reserve on Friday. The three-day event is being organised by the North East Butterfly India group with SEED (Society for Education and Environmental Development) as host NGO of the meet in collaboration with the Namdapha tiger reserve authorities. An organiser said the main motive is to share knowledge about butterflies and their importance in nature and to understand their role. Waterproof shoes and socks are must to protect from leeches, which are abundant in the forest. “Namdapha is an excellent butterfly destination from all respects and is a must for all those who would like to see new butterflies and learn more about them,” a butterfly lover said. The park boasts 355 butterfly species. The park harbours a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna and has many rare species, including the brown gorgon, yellow gorgon, tailed sulphur and brimstone. “It is always handy to keep a guidebook even for experienced butterfly experts as it is necessary to consult even when one sees a new butterfly,” a wildlife expert said. A checklist of butterflies of Namdapha tiger reserve will be made through a field survey which will be conducted during the event and members will present documentations and discuss conservation issues.
