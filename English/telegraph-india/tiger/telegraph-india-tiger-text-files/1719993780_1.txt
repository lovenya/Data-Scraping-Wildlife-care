Melbourne: An out-of-sorts Tiger Woods battled to a share of the lead after the third round of the Australian Masters on Saturday, as his rivals failed to capitalise on an off day for the world No. 1. Woods held a three-stroke lead going into the third round and seemed set to charge ahead after draining a monster birdie putt on the par-four second. But that was almost as good as it got for the 14-times Major champion, who said he felt lucky to escape with an even par 72. Woods ended the day joint leader with local hopes Greg Chalmers and James Nitties on 10 under par at the $1.4 million co-sanctioned event. American Jason Dufner and Australia’s Cameron Percy are two shots further back. “I was very fortunate, somehow I found a way to shoot even par today because it certainly should have been a lot worse than that,” Woods told reporters.
