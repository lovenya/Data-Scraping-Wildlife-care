Durban: Dale Steyn doesn’t wish to be a hero on “every ball,” but he’s almost turning out to be one. On Sunday evening, after a media conference, the wrecker-in-chief (14 wickets so far in the series) took a few questions exclusively from The Telegraph. The following are excerpts His role model(s) No one person, really... I’ve drawn inspiration from the biggest performers... Roger Federer, Tiger Woods... I’ve tried to learn from the achievers. Inspiration in cricket... Like I’ve pointed out, no one person... But, yes, I found Brett Lee impressive and one could learn from him. Approach to life I try and listen to as many people as possible and, then, try and absorb the better things. I see myself as a listener and a learner. Importance of speed Isn’t everything. Now, excerpts from the media  conference Bowling in Centurion and bowling at Kingsmead Much the same... That Graeme (Smith) decided to again field shows the confidence he has in his bowlers... It gets down to the basics and Graeme has, indeed, been setting good fields. Lonwabo Tsotsbe getting two wickets and taking a brilliant catch off his bowling to send back V.V.S. Laxman... He bowled nicely and will be a part of this attack for some time to come... Yes, he took his first catch in Tests... I’d say I had only three wickets and one was his. There have, of course, been times when he goes off to sleep! Getting cramps in the groin region I’m fine now... For the first time, the physio (Brandon Jackson) told me I was over-hydrated. Lastly, on being the bowler he is (Laughs) I’m lucky... I don’t try to be a hero on every ball, but do what the captain wants me to.
