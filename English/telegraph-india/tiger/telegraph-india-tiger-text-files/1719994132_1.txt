The female Royal Bengal Tiger, which had kept interests of wildlife experts riveted to the picturesque Dalma Hills near Jamshedpur for four months, has left for Chakradharpur forests in West Singhbhum, albeit not alone. After migrating from Simlipal Tiger Reserve in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha to Dalma sometime in early July last year, the pregnant animal had given birth to two cubs by the end of the same month. The family of three was spotted by foresters in the hilly woods just before they relocated to their new home. Kamlesh Pandey, divisional forest officer (wildlife), Ranchi, said after the big cat was first sighted by a forest official in July 2016, scat samples were sent to the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for confirmation. "Though the analysis report is yet to reach us, we established the presence of the tigress by the quantity of cattle being killed in and around Dalma," he said. According to Pandey, between July and November last year, nearly two dozen cows, buffalos and even pigs were mauled to death. "At least 20 animals either disappeared or their half-eaten carcasses were found. After mid-November, however, the killings declined, suggesting that the tiger family had moved on," the DFO said. Pandey pointed out that the tigress and her cubs had sneaked into Chakradharpur forests a week ago, after staying in the jungles of Kandra in Seraikela-Kharsawan for more than a month. Seraikela DFO A. Ekka said villagers had spotted the big cat once in December. "While the mother and cubs were around, a cow was killed and a few other animals were also reported missing," he said. Ranchi DFO Pandey said the presence of a tiger family in Dalma for four months suggested that the vegetation was adequately healthy to offer a pregnant predator enough cover to give birth and raise a family.
