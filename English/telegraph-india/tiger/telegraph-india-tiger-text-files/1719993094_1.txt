Justin Thomas secured a four-stroke lead over Adam Scott and JB Holmes after the third round at the Genesis Open in Los Angeles on Sunday. Thomas, who eagled the first hole, started the round tied with Australian Scott. The American Thomas jumped clear with a six-under-par 65 at Riviera. He posted a 17-under 196 total, while Scott managed a 69 and was joined on 13 under by American Holmes (68). Thomas was seven strokes clear of anyone else. Big guns Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods were seemingly too far back to have a realistic chance of victory. McIlroy (69) and Spieth (70) were eight strokes behind, while Woods trailed by 10 despite a stellar 65. His score matched Thomas’s as the best of the third round. The Genesis Open is the only event on the PGA Tour that Woods has played at least 10 times without a win. Former world No. 1 Thomas has already won nine times on the PGA Tour, including a major at the 2017 PGA Championship. The 25-year-old’s most recent victory came at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational last August. Players barely had time for a quick bite on a marathon day after having resumed the third round in semi-darkness at 6.45 a.m. local time. The tournament was put behind schedule due to a seven-hour rain delay on Thursday. Earlier, Americans JB Holmes and Patrick Rodgers were two shots behind after two holes, while Woods picked up an eagle and three birdies in his first four holes. Woods could only smile ruefully as he contemplated Sunday's early resumption. “It’s not even going to be light yet, I don't think,” he said. “This has been a long week. I’ll probably get up about 2 or 3 (a.m.) and start the process (of preparing).” Thomas had to finish off six holes of his second round on Saturday.
