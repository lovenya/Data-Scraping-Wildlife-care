English bar in SP Kanpur, May 4 (PTI): The Samajwadi Party’s Kanpur wing has asked party workers not to use English in invitation cards for family events. Or else, party members would boycott the programme. “This year, the party is celebrating the birth centenary of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and trying to fulfil the dream of the great leader by protesting against use of the language. We believe that English must be learnt but not be used as an official language as it is a foreign language,” district president Jitender Bahadur Singh said. The cards, the party said, could be printed in Hindi or any other Indian language. “Like Japan and China are developing by using their mother tongue, we shall also do the same,” Singh added.
