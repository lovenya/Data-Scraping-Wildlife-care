Daltonganj: The shrunken carcass of a four-year-old male elephant was found in the Betla range of Palamau Tiger Reserve late on Saturday, indicating untimely death due to acute dehydration. Sources in PTR said the animal died on May 4, but his herd didn't abandon him until the next evening. "Autopsy found his intestines had dried up. There were food particles, but no fluid at all. Hence, his stomach had shrunk. The skin had shrivelled up too," said Anil Kumar Mishra, deputy director of the 1,129sqkm reserve's north division that includes Betla. He maintained that the protective herd of 12-15 elephants included the adolescent male's mother. "She tried to get him up and walking, but he was too fragile and kept falling down perhaps. Hence, the abrasions." According to Mishra, the spot was 3.5km from a watering hole while the Auranga River at the reserve had completely dried up. Asked if this was the first such death at PTR, he mentioned two more instances - one in Garu range in 2013 and another in Maromar in 2015.
