Ranchi, March 2: Salim will never roar again. The Royal Bengal tiger, aged 16, today died at the Birsa Munda Zoological Park after prolonged illness caused by old age. “Salim has not been keeping well for sometime now. He suffered kidney failure and wasn’t running well for a long time. Even his jaws and teeth had become very weak recently,” said director of the zoo P.K. Verma. “He was down with high fever last night and didn’t eat anything. This further complicated matters and he passed away around noon today,” Verma added. The life span of a tiger varies between 15 and 17 years and Salim’s death isn’t unnatural. According to J.B. Jauher, principal conservator of forest (wildlife), who rushed to the zoo as soon as he got the news, the big cat was brought here in 2004 after being rescued from a circus in Uttar Pradesh. “In fact, Salim was in a very bad state in 2004 itself. Earnest efforts by the zoo officials to revive him finally gave the Royal Bengal tiger a new lease of life,” Jauher said. A pall of gloom descended on the zoo today soon after Salim’s demise. “Every animal here is very dear to us, but Salim was special as we had fought a lot to keep him alive after he was brought to the zoo. We had thought then that he would not survive as he was not in the best of his health. But he pulled through and became our prized possession. Even the visitors adored him,” said Verma. Now, Birsa Munda Zoological Park has two Royal Bengal tigers left — one male, Sugreev, and the other female, Durga. “Both are in the pink of health,” the zoo director said.
