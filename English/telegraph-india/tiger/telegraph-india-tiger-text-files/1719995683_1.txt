Vehicles overturn, explosions boom, glass shards fly in all directions and bullets rain as Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff’s Indian soldiers show up to thwart the plans of a masked villain, played by Prithviraj Sukumaran, in the teaser of Ali Abbas Zafar’s Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, dropped by the makers on Wednesday. The one-minute-thirty-eight-second-long video begins with an establishing shot of trucks traversing a mountainous highway. The atmosphere swiftly becomes intense as a bullet strikes one of the vehicles, and the camera pans to the antagonist, who vows to bring about the permanent destruction of India. Subsequent sequences feature high-tech laboratory scenes, followed by a glimpse of an official meeting, suggesting that the adversaries intend to employ scientific means in their fight against India. “Jo acchai aur burai ki jung ko hamesha ke liye khatam kr dega (One who will end the conflict between good and bad forever)...Who will stop me?” roars the antagonist menacingly. As though in a reply to the voiceover, a helicopter lands and Akshay and Tiger emerge wielding guns. “Dil se soldier, dimaag se shaitaan hai hum, Bachke rehna humse, Hindustaan hai hum (Soldiers from heart, evil in scheming, beware of us, we are Indians),” the duo affirms, as the teaser overflows with high-octane action scenes. In this deeply patriotic film, Akshay and Tiger essay the roles of Bade Miyan and Chote Miyan respectively. Produced by Pooja Entertainment and AAZ Films, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is a fresh take on the David Dhawan-helmed 1998 film starring Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda. The film is slated to hit theatres in April on the occasion of Eid. Bade Miyan Chote Miyan will clash with the Ajay Devgn-starrer Maidaan, also scheduled to release on Eid.
