Speculations about a possible Shah Rukh Khan vs Salman Khan showdown in an upcoming YRF Spy Universe film rocked Twitter on Thursday, with the hashtag Tiger vs Pathaan trending on the microblogging website. According to trade experts on Twitter, War and Pathaan director Siddharth Anand has been roped in to helm the film, which is likely to release in Eid 2025. However, there was no confirmation on any such development from Yash Raj Films. Salman’s cameo in Shah Rukh’s 2023 release Pathaan became one of the most-talked-about sequences from the action-packed blockbuster, which went on to become the highest-grossing Hindi language film in the world with a collection of over Rs 1,000 crore. Meanwhile, reports about Shah Rukh’s cameo in the upcoming Katrina Kaif and Salman-starrer Tiger 3 are also doing the rounds. Shah Rukh is likely to be part of a high-octane action sequence in Tiger 3. Shah Rukh’s Pathaan, Salman’s Tiger and Hrithik Roshan’s Kabir are part of the YRF Spy Universe. Salman’s Ek Tha Tiger, which released in 2012, was the first-ever film to release under the banner, followed by Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), War (2019) and Pathaan (2023). While Salman is gearing up for the release of his upcoming film Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan, Shah Rukh is waiting for Atlee’s Jawan to hit the theatres later this year.
