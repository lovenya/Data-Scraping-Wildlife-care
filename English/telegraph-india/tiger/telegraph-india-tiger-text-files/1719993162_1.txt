Bhubaneswar: Much to the relief of the forest officials, the three-year-old male tiger brought to Satkosia Tiger Reserve from the Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh stalked its prey, a wild boar, attacked and killed it. On Friday morning, the boar had been released into its enclosure at the Satkosia reserve in Angul district, hoping that the big cat would prey on the animal. But till late night, it had not attacked the animal. The forest officials, who were monitoring the movement of the tiger through CCTV, were on the edge. But between 2am to 2.30am, the tiger killed its prey. Additional principal chief conservator of forest Sudarshan Panda said: "Last night, the tiger killed the live prey. It was also found bathing in the water body created for it inside the special enclosure." Panda said: "There in no problem with the health of the tiger. We will shortly release it in the Satkosia forest." The enclosure of the tiger is spread over 2.5 acres in the Satkosia reserve. Officials said if the experiment of this big cat's translocation went well, they would bring another five tigers from Madya Pradesh and release them in Satkosia. However, the people of Boudh district, who are living in the core area of Satkosia, on Saturday protested against the administration's plan to relocate them to a new place. "We will not leave our village. We have been living here since the days of the British," said Tilottama, who is in her seventies. Boudh district collector Madhu Sudan Mishra said: "We will give adequate compensation to the people, including Rs 10 lakh in cash and a house to the displaced families, once they are relocated to a new place."
