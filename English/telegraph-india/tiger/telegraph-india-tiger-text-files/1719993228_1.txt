Dubai: Rory McIlroy is a more talented golfer than 14-time major winner Tiger Woods, according to world No. 1 Luke Donald, on the eve of his Dubai World Championship showdown with the young Northern Irishman. “Tiger’s work ethic has always been tremendous, and his mindset as well,” Donald said. “But I think Rory has more pure talent. “I have always said that, of the guys I’ve played with, Rory has the most talent. I see him winning lots of tournaments and lots of majors.” Donald, bidding to become the first player to win the orders of merit on both sides of the Atlantic, leads second-placed McIlroy by more than $1 million going into the final European Tour event of the season in Dubai. The Englishman needs to finish in the top eight this week to guarantee ending the campaign as European No. 1 for the first time in his career, but he seemed almost as keen to laud McIlroy’s skills as he was to celebrate his own achievements. “Rory showed the world how great he can be when he won the US Open,” said Donald, who clinched the US PGA Tour’s money-list crown. “That was an unbelievable way to play in a major event and finish it off like he did.”
