Bhubaneswar: Animal safaris at the Nandankanan zoo have remained off limits to visitors since January 16, when the contract of the private agency operating the service expired. The zoo has safaris for lion, tiger, bear and herbivores. A zoo official said the agency ran five buses for the safaris on normal days, while during peak season between November and February the number of trips were eight. The zoo earned more than Rs 1 crore from the service a year. However, a series of accidents brought the agency under scanner. A tourist, Amiya Bharimal, died when a safari bus hit him on January 3. Two others were injured in the incident. Similarly, last November around 40 tourists were stuck in the lion safari when their bus hit a muddy patch. They were rescued only after intervention of the safari authorities. The officials had a tough time getting the lions inside the den and shifting the tourists to another bus. Zoo officials said they had floated tenders twice to resume the safari service. "The first tender was floated in November last year. But the bidder tried to put pressure on us with its terms and conditions and we had to float the tender again. The bidder, however, did not turn up," said a zoo official. He also said that the price of safari tickets would be increased to Rs 60 from Rs 50. Visitors also demanded resumptoon of the safari. "A number of visitors turn up at the zoo to have a glimpse of animals kept in the safaris. Other than the safari, the authorities are yet to resume the ropeway and toy train services that are major tourist attractions," said a visitor. Deputy director of the zoo Jayant Dash said they would soon float a fresh tender to start the safari. "The fresh tender will be floated in another week and the safari service will resume by the last week of May."
