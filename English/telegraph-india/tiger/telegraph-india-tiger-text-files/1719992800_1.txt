Ek baar jo maine commitment kar di, fir main apne aap ki bhi nahi sunta — Salman Khan said it in Wanted but the actor seems live by it in real life too. Recently, he hosted an awards show despite getting a sore throat before the main event. But the superstar went ahead and hosted the show, albeit in a heavy voice. Sallu bhai reached the venue on time and immediately went on stage to rehearse his lines. Onlookers on the set vouch for Salman taking the stage by storm in spite of being under the weather. Salman, who’ll be seen on the silver screen next Friday with Tiger Zinda Hai along with Katrina Kaif, said: “The weather hasn’t suited me and so I am not feeling well and have been under the weather. There have been back-to-back professional commitments because of which I haven’t rested well and so the viral has taken over. I am waiting to take a break and recover fully.” Joining Salman as host was his “Judwaa” Varun Dhawan. The award show will air on New Year’s Eve.
