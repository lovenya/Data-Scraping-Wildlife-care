Ranchi: Three men have so far been arrested in connection with the illegal trade of wild animal body parts after Saturday evening's raid at a shop in wholesale hub Upper Bazaar under Kotwali thana in the heart of the capital. Two were identified as Vijay Kumar Gupta, owner of Vijay Store that had been raided, and Vishwanath Murarka, owner of another similar shop called Murarka Store, barely 500 metres apart. The third is a small-time employee at Vijay Store. A forest department source said Vijay Store primarily stocked puja items but also sold wild animal parts to "special customers" who believed in black magic and sorcery. Over 50 body parts of wild animals, including claws of tigers and bears, small pieces of elephant tusks, bearskin, owl skulls, lizard skeletons, among others, were found inside Vijay Store during the Saturday evening raid by a joint team of foresters and city police. "Retailing such items in the capital is bizarre," Ranchi divisional forest officer Rajiv Lochan Bakshi admitted. He said they were not ruling out more such illegal retail in the city and outskirts and were trying to figure out bigger links - poachers, transporters, traders - in the network. "I don't see them (the arrested trio) as a big organised gang so far, but yes, there could be splinter gangs, which could help us lead to a big racket," he said. He credited Saturday's raid to "solid tips". "For some days, our men had been mapping this place posing as customers," he said. A forest source said questioning the arrested men yielded vital clues. "This morning (Sunday), we raided a place to nab a person but that didn't materialise properly. But more arrests will happen," he said.
