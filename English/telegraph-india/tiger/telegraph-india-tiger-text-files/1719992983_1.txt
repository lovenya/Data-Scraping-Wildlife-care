Jorhat, Dec. 27: An alert has been sounded in Assam’s Orang National Park following the recovery of a Royal Bengal tiger carcass yesterday. The post-mortem report indicates the tiger may have died of poisoning. The viscera has been sent to the forensic laboratory in Guwahati for confirmation. Park director S.K. Daila said the carcass of the five-year-old female tiger was recovered from a dense forest area near the Pachnoi river by forest guards. “The carcass bore no injury marks and there was nothing unusual noticed at the location from where it was found,” he said. The recovery of the carcass comes amid speculation that villagers residing near the periphery of the national park might have tried to poison the big cats in retaliation to the increasing tiger attacks on cattle. Villages near Orang National Park have seen a rise in conflicts between Royal Bengal tigers and humans, with the big cats frequently straying out of the park and attacking cattle. Tigers have killed more than 20 cattle heads in the past few months. Daila said there has been an increase in tiger population at Orang and, therefore, big cats were frequently straying out of the park. “The actual figure will be known only after a census but we have spotted two tiger cubs born a few months back,” he said. The park official said, a week back, two tigers strayed out of the park and entered a human habitat and the forest staff had to fire in the air to chase the two tigers back inside the park. The park authorities signed an MoU with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) recently to minimise the  increasing incidents of conflicts between tigers and humans. According to the MoU, to gain the confidence of the villagers, the WWF would pay interim relief to owners of cattle killed by tigers. “We have also organised joint patrolling by villagers and forest guards in areas where there are frequent incidents of tigers killing cattle,” Daila said.
