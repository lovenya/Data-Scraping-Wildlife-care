Lake Buena Vista, Oct. 25 (AFP): Tiger Woods made his 113th consecutive cut on the US PGA Tour, matching Byron Nelson’s 54-year-old record. And though Woods was more concerned at the birdie putts Friday, he failed to make on the Magnolia Course to fall four strokes behind halfway leader Vijai Singh, he was most satisfied with his accomplishment. “I’m very proud,” he said. “It’s not something that is easy to do. There are times when I should have missed. A little luck and a lot of hard work has paid off.” It’s tough to compare eras in any sport, including golf. Even though Woods’ streak includes 23 events that did not have a cut, he has demonstrated sustained excellence in an era of perhaps unparalleled depth. Woods struck the ball nicely, hitting all but one fairway and 15 greens in regulation, but he was bamboozled by the greens. “I’m a little angry at myself for not making any putts today,” he lamented. “If I’d putted just halfway decent, I would have made three or four more putts. “I’m right there. If I can just get my putter rolling, I’ll get some momentum going and start running the tables.” Woods paid tribute to Nelson — the golfer and the human being. “His record is phenomenal, but I think he’s a better person than his playing record,” Woods said. While Woods was on his way to a bit of history, Singh was savouring a back nine 29 en route to a seven-under-par 65 on the Palm. He was a little slow to rub the sleep from his eyes on a delightful morning, playing his front nine in even par. But once he woke up there was no stopping him as he reeled off five straight birdies, starting at his 10th hole, followed by an eagle two holes later. “I didn’t play well my front side,” Singh said. “I was fighting my swing a little bit. Even par is the best I could have done, but I got going on the back nine, made some nice putts and started feeling good again.”
