A Sunderbans tiger was operated on at Alipore zoo on Tuesday for the removal of a fibroid mass from its front right knee. The male tiger, aged between six and seven years, will be kept under observation for around two weeks, said V.K. Yadav, member-secretary of the Bengal Zoo Authority. "The operation was successful. We want to release it back into the forest but will take a call after monitoring its recovery," he said. The surgery began around noon and went on for more than a couple of hours. A team of five vets - headed by Rudradeb Mukherjee, the deputy-director of the animal resource development department - performed the surgery. The tiger was limping when it was captured from a village in Kultali, in the Sunderbans, in December. He was shifted to the Alipore zoo hospital, where a series of tests revealed that a fibroid mass in the right front knee was leading to fluid accumulation. "We slit the leg open and removed the fibroid mass. A fair amount of fluid was drained out, too," Mukherjee told 
Metro. The tiger, which weighs 130kg, was given a heavy dose of general anaesthesia for the surgery. Despite the heavy dose, the mouth of the tiger was tied. The tongue was left protruding for better aeration, Mukherjee said. A net was kept nearby as a secondary precaution. The tiger should be back on its feet within 10 days, Mukherjee said. "It is a jolly good cat. It should be able to do all normal activities, including hunting," he said. The tiger will only be given chicken for the next couple of days. Later, beef and other meat will be included in the diet. The tiger had strayed into the Deulbari village in Kultali and lifted cattle. Following a complaint by villagers, forest department officials captured it using a trap cage. The big cat was treated at the tiger rescue centre in Jharkhali before being shifted to Calcutta.
