Colombo, July 15 (Reuters): Factional fighting between Sri Lanka’s rebels spilled into an eastern prison today, where a Tamil Tiger cadre shot dead two rivals and briefly took refuge on the prison roof, military officials said. They said the inmate opened fire in the early morning, shooting dead a fellow inmate thought to be loyal to a breakaway leader called Karuna, whose split from the rebels destabilised the region and complicated the island’s peace bid. The inmate shot two others, one of whom subsequently died, before fleeing to the prison roof, armed with a grenade, his handgun and a cyanide capsule. He later gave himself up. “He has surrendered to security forces and the army has dispatched bomb disposal teams to check the prison,” said military spokesman Colonel Sumedha Perera. “The forces have cordoned off the place and are clearing it for any other war-like items,” he said of the standoff, which lasted several hours.
