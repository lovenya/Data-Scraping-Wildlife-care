Ponte Vedra Beach (Florida): Tiger Woods was a noticeable absentee on the final day of practice for the Players’ Championship on Wednesday and the PGA Tour was unaware of his whereabouts. The world No.1 was scheduled to hold a news conference earlier in the day at the TPC at Sawgrass. That was cancelled after PGA Tour officials were told he would not be at the course. No reason was given for Woods’ absence. There was speculation the 30-year-old American had been called away because of his father’s health. Earl Woods has been battling prostate cancer.
