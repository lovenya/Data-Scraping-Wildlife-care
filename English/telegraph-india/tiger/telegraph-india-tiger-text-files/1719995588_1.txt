Tiger 3, starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, managed to rake in only Rs 22 crore on its fourth day in theatres, resulting in a significant dip at the box office for the Maneesh Sharma-helmed spy action thriller. The latest addition to the YRF Spy Universe has so far totalled Rs 169.5 crore in India, while its gross worldwide collection now stands at Rs 241.85 crore. Also starring Emraan Hashmi, Tiger 3 embarked on its cinematic journey with Rs 44.5 crore nett on its opening day on Sunday. The Hindi version contributed Rs 43 crore nett to the kitty, while the Telugu and Tamil versions added Rs 1.3 crore nett and Rs 2 lakh nett, respectively. The actioner experienced a notable surge on its first Monday (Day 2), recording a 32.58% increase in collections, totalling Rs 59 crore nett.  It managed to rake in Rs 44 crore nett on Tuesday (Day 3), reflecting a 25.42 per cent dip in collections. However, things worsened on Wednesday (Day 4) as the Salman-starrer could only earn half of its previous day’s collection. Despite its falling figures, Tiger 3 has emerged as the fourth-highest grosser of the year in terms of four-day collections at the domestic box office. Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan accumulated Rs 341.8 crore nett in the first four days, while Shah Rukh’s Pathaan raked in Rs 220 crore nett during the same period. Sunny Deol's Gadar 2 collected Rs 173.58 crore nett till Day 4.
