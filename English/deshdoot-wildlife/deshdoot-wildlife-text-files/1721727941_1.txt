The Western Ghats of the state have a very rich biodiversity. The state has saw a slight decrease in forest cover. The Indian State Forest Report (ISFR) 2019 has recorded a decrease in forest area by 0.02 percent in just two years. The Maharashtra state has lost 0.02 percent of its total forest cover in just two years, which takes centuries too regenerate the forest wealth. In the recent report of ISFR 2017, the state had forest area of 16.93 percent of kin its total area. In the report 2019, the ISFR has reported that the percentage has came down by 0.2 percent from 2017 to 2019 and the state has forest cover in its 16.91 percent of the total geographical area. On the other hand, Nashik district has saw an increase in its forest cover. In earlier report, the district had 6.88 percent forest area out of the 15,530 sq km total geographical area. In the report of ISFR, the district has 6.93 percent out of its total land covered with forest an increase of 0.05 percent.
