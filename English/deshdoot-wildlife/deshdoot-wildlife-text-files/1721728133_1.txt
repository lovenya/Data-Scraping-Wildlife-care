NASHIK: Lockdown has been imposed in sanctuaries, reserved forest areas and forts in the Nashik forest area in the backdrop of the ‘Delta Plus’ virus and the possible third wave of Covid-19. On Sunday, the forest department and the police administration had cordoned off the areas of Anjaneri-Trimbakeshwar, Igatpuri and Bhandaradra Therefore, tourists had to return without enjoying nature. Every year, after the onset of the monsoon, tourists turn to nature sanctuaries and reserved forests for rainy season trips. However, this year, due to the increasing prevalence of Covid-19, the wildlife department has banned tourists from entering the famous Nandur Madhyameshwar in Niphad taluka, Aner dam in Dhule district, Yaval in Jalgaon and Kalsubai Harishchandragad sanctuary in Ahmednagar as well as reserved forest areas. Meanwhile, two days ago, a meeting of the villagers of Kalsubai Harishchandragad sanctuary was held at the Forest Rest House in Shendi regarding the weekend lockdown. The meeting decided to ban tourists during the weekend lockdown. However, even before this decision, tourists from other cities including Nagpur had booked in advance, which had created a problem. Therefore, it has been clarified by the wildlife department that the tourism ban will be effectively implemented from next week.
