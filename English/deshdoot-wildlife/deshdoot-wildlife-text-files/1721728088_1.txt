NASHIK: A female leopard, sheltered in Porjeâ€™s sugarcane farm in Mauje Wadner Shivar on the banks of the Darna river, has reached a safe natural habitat by recuddling her newborn cubs. The reunion attempt of a mother leopard and a cub by the forest department and wildlife lovers was again successful. The female leopard got separated from her newborn cubs after going out in search of prey. On May 26 evening, sugarcane harvesting was completed in the afternoon at Porje farm at Wadner within the limits of Nashik west forest department. At this time, two cubs of leopards were seen by the sugarcane workers under the sugarcane chip. Porje had then informed the forest department. Immediately, forest ranger Vivek Bhadane, forest ranger Anil Ahirrao and honorary wildlife warden Vaibhav Bhogle rushed to the spot. After making sure the cubs were healthy, the cubs were kept in the same place again. Late at night, a female leopard arrived and took one of her cubs into her mouth on Thursday morning. However, the female did not return as the sun rises. The next night the female returned, and she took the other cub to close to safety. With the help of Eco-Eco, the forest department had installed a 360-degree digital camera in the sugarcane field. Through this camera, the forest workers were watching the movements of the leopard cubs all night long. The journey was captured on camera as the female was coming to the field at night and took the cub away. The migration journey of the cubs from their mother was accurately captured by the cameo. Two years ago, leopard cubs were found in the area in a similar manner.
