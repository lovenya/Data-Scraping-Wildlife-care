NASHIK: On the outskirts of Sahyadri in Nashik district, Satmala, Satpuda, Salburi, Dobari, and other forts (more than 60), should be assigned the title of state protected monuments by the state government and district administration. Shivakarya Gadkot Conservation Society of Nashik has put forth the demand to protect the heritage of the district. The land of Nashik hosts the highest number of hill forts in the state. More than 30 of them have a forest cover encompassing various herbs, fruit trees, flowers, wildlife, and bird species. Major forts are under the State Archaeological Department and the district administrationâ€™s department. The condition of the forts is deteriorating day-by-day. Ramshej, Harihar, Ratangad, Hatgad in the district are crowded on Saturdays and Sundays. Apart from a few fort lovers, most of the tourists are destroying the heritage site. They throw plastic at various places and destroy the walls by writing nuisance on them. The forest department needs to take strict action against the miscreants. A letter regarding the same has been forwarded to the state government. The conservation is protecting the forts since the past 15 years. The residents and the government needs to act on the miscreants and save our cultural heritage.
