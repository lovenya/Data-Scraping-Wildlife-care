Meanwhile, in the last six years, 114 leopards have died in Nashik district due to various reasons including vehicle collisions, falling into wells, falling ill and the struggle between leopards for territory. The sighting of leopards is not new in certain parts of Nashik city and district. Every day, leopards are seen in some places. Along with leopards, 38 blackbucks and 21 deer have died in the last five years, and measures to protect and conserve wildlife are failing. As wildlife habitat in the western and eastern forests of Nashik is being destroyed, leopards are migrating in search of prey. In five years, 24 leopards have died in road accidents. About Fifteen hyenas have also died in the accident. Be careful while driving Drivers should control their speed on the road where the area is leopard prone. Driving with care can save the life of a leopard. In many places, leopards fall into the wells and die due to lack of timely help in the fields.
