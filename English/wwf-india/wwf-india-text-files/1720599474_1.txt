Hundreds of cyclists join in to support Earth Hour 2012 



New Delhi: WWF-India, in association with Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance Company Limited organized the ‘Earth Hour 2012 Cyclothon’ today, a signature lead up activity to Earth Hour in New Delhi, now organized for three consecutive years! 



Over a 100 cyclists demonstrated solidarity and support for Earth Hour 2012 at the cyclothon as they cycled 8 kms from the WWF-India office along Lodhi Road in the heart of the city. The cyclists were a diverse mix of demographics from corporate executives to schools and colleges students and even home makers. Many brought their own cycles to the venue, while some were available at the venue with support from BSA Hercules. The event also witnessed participation from a number of volunteers, who stood along the route with placards and banners, encouraging the cyclists to pedal for the planet. 



This year, Earth Hour 2012, to be observed on 31st March from 8:30 – 9:30 PM, aims to inspire citizens to take action for their city by switching off lights to make their city the Earth Hour Champion. Whichever city receives maximum participation from its citizens, organizations, and government will be declared the Earth Hour Champion. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata, are participating in the race to become the Earth Hour Champion, and more are welcome to join.



Addressing the crowd at the cyclothon, Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India said, “Every year, we aim to take Earth Hour to a new level and inculcate a sense of belongingness and ownership among people towards their planet. Earth Hour 2012 aims to encourage cities to collectively shift towards sustainable development and citizens to reduce the growing environmental impact of our urban lifestyles. Adopting cycling as a way of commuting is a step in the direction of a sustainable way of living, and I am happy to see the people, young and old, cycling here today to reiterate their support towards Earth Hour.” 



He further added, “The city of Delhi has received tremendous support for Earth Hour from the first year India joined the global movement. It is heartening to see Delhiites supporting the cause with such enthusiasm and dedication”



The energy and commitment of so many employees of Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance who participated in the cyclothon and pledged their support for Earth Hour was effectual. Mr John Holden, Chief Executive Officer, Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance, said, “Climate change is undoubtedly the biggest environmental challenge of our times affecting people in countless ways. As responsible citizens of this planet, it is essential for us to act now by choosing a sustainable way of life. Earth Hour, an expression of global solidarity for a low carbon future reinforces that all actions have to begin with the individual and cycling is a great start as it also promotes a healthy lifestyle.” 



He further added, “Canara HSBC Oriental Bank of Commerce Life Insurance is privileged to partner with WWF-India for Earth Hour 2012. Life insurance, our business, is all about social security and protection, aimed at the well-being of human beings and the society as a whole. To show our support to the environment, we now use recycled paper for all our customer communication like policy packs, renewal notices, letters etc. This is just one of the several initiatives. We pledge to use all resources responsibly and identify ways in which we can reduce their consumption for a greener planet.”



This year, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has also joined hands with WWF-India and has pledged his support to the Earth Hour 2012 as the national brand ambassador. In 2011, a record 1.8 billion individuals across more than 5200 cities in 135 countries participated worldwide by switching off lights, and pledging to responsible actions that benefit our planet. In India, Earth Hour reached more than 130 cities, including tier II and III, small towns and even villages. Last year also marked the start of a new phase for Earth Hour, as it went Beyond the Hour, encouraging individuals to switch off and also commit to a more sustainable lifestyle and incorporate changes into their day to day lives. Since 2007, Earth Hour has set new standards and has broken its own records of mass participation. From here on, Earth Hour will not only be an annual lights out event, but an opportunity for communities to be part of the world’s environmental solutions through responsible action all year round. Delhi cycles for a greener tomorrow!
