India, 23rd March 2024: Over the last 18 years, the lights-off moment has seen entire streets, buildings, landmarks, and city skylines go dark - an unmissable sight that drew public attention to nature loss and the climate crisis. Earth Hour 2024 aims to create the Biggest Hour for Earth, stressing the collective power of individuals and communities in tackling climate and nature loss challenges. The overarching goal is to inspire long-term commitments to energy efficiency, sustainable practices and shared responsibility for a resilient and optimistic future.

 

Key landmarks across the country that stood in solidarity with Earth Hour 2024 by switching off their lights were:

 Earth Hour 2024 serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of our planet, the need to protect it, and how little time we have to do so.  As landmarks and homes across the planet take part in Earth Hour’s iconic switch-off, we are asking everyone to ‘switch off’ themselves by taking a break from their routine and everyday distractions and spending 60 minutes doing something positive for our planet and nature around us.

 

Earth Hour celebrated this year on 23rd March, is the largest global grassroots movement for the environment. The aim is to create an unstoppable movement for nature to recognise the role of individuals in creating solutions to the planet’s most pressing environmental challenges and harness the collective power of its millions of supporters.
