New Delhi: On 16 July 2018, TRAFFIC and WWF-India hosted a group of 61 Indian Forest Service (IFS) Officers at the WWF-India Secretariat in New Delhi where they were given an overview of the programmes undertaken by TRAFFIC and WWF-India for conservation and protection of wildlife across India.



These in-service IFS Officers from batches 1997 to 2004, who are undergoing Mid Career Training Programme (MCTP) from Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA) belong to various state / central government cadres and are in the ranks of Chief Conservator of Forests and Conservator of Forests. Many of the participants are heading organisations outside of the forest department and are in various Ministries of Government of India and State Governments.



Dr B. Balaji IFS, Associate Professor, IGNFA, introduced MCTP that involves four different modules viz., management module, ministerial attachment, overseas study tour and forest and environment module.  The session with WWF-India and TRAFFIC as part of MCTP, was organised with the objective of introducing the participants to the working of leading conservation Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the country.



Mr Ravi Singh, CEO and Secretary General, WWF-India welcomed the participants and talked about WWF’s establishment in India and the key areas where WWF-India has contributed to wildlife conservation and policy making. He also talked about the need to have strong minded administrators who have a holistic understanding of the environment and conservation issues to lead on wildlife conservation and protection measures in India.



Dr Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF-India gave an overview of WWF-India’s strategy and various work undertaken in the priority landscapes across India. She also highlighted the linkages between WWF programmes internally and various government agencies externally.



Dr Saket Badola IFS, Head TRAFFIC India, who coordinated this programme also presented on TRAFFIC’s initiatives in the country to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade. He gave an insight into TRAFFIC’s pioneering programmes in India such as training of wildlife sniffer dogs for wildlife crime prevention and detection, now being recognised as a potent force to curb illegal wildlife crime.



The Q&A session that followed involved the Directors of various programmes of WWF-India such as Dr Dipankar Ghose, Shri Suresh Babu and Ms Radhika Suri, responding to the queries raised by the participants.



Going by the response of the participants towards this interaction, TRAFFIC is positive that such orientation programmes from time to time will help in strengthening synergies between enforcement agencies and NGOs working for conservation and tackling wildlife crime in India.
