Four days since the abduction of its six volunteers, WWF-India remains hopeful of an early release of the three still in captivity. Naushad Zaman, Gautam Kishore Sarma, and Pranjal Saikia are reported to be safe and in good health. WWF-India is in regular touch with their families.



We hope that their abductors will release the three boys soon. These boys from Assam, were working in the interest of their state and conserving its natural beauty. Their families are at loss to understand the reason as to why the children have to undergo this trauma for a cause that is in the interest of nature and society.



WWF-India’s six young volunteers, including three women, were abducted on Sunday 6th February while conducting field monitoring for the All India Tiger Estimation Project in Chirang Forest Division of Western Assam.Three of the abducted women volunteers were released on 8th Feb. WWF- India is working closely with government authorities and the Bodoland Territorial Council for the speedy release of the three remaining volunteers.
