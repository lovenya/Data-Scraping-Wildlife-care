The quiz, that started in 2008, aims to raise awareness and inculcate a sense of pride amongst today’s children about India’s rich biodiversity and the need to protect it. The theme for this year’s quiz, “Maze of the Natural World”, was an attempt to introduce the participants to the world of wonder that our environment has to offer. The event saw participation from 28 city level winners across the country and 2 winners from Nepal.
