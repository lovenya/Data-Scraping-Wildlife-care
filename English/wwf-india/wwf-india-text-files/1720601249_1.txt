Mahabalipuram: On the occasion of the 44th Chess Olympiad, ChessKid, in partnership with WWF India, brings you Stump the GM! with the legendary five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand, who is both an ambassador for ChessKid and WWF India. 29th July is when the first chess moves on boards will be made at the Olympiad, but it is also International Tiger Day. The Tiger of Madras-as Viswanathan Anand is also known- shared, “As the environment education ambassador of WWF India, it is an opportune moment on International Tiger day to talk about protection of tigers.  Students and the youth can play a key role in their conservation. Today our young generation is quite aware and is keen to take steps towards making a difference.”

Stump the GM! got the Indian legend GM Viswanathan Anand and 18-year-old GM Prithu Gupta to face off by challenging each other with chess studies and puzzles to solve. Fans and chess lovers enjoyed this spectacle and had a unique opportunity to ask questions (and try to out solve the grandmasters!). Each participant walked away with gold ChessKid membership. “ChessKid is designed to make learning chess FUN! Combining entertainment with education allows children to remember important tactical and strategic patterns and proceed to more challenging lessons without feeling demotivated," says Viswanathan Anand, an honourable ambassador of ChessKid. His son Akhil enjoys learning chess from the site too!

 

The Tiger Anthem (TIGER TIGER) was launched at the event, sung by ‘SOS from kids’ who were on ‘Britain’s Got Talent.’ They are a global community kids choir who are nature enthusiasts and want to protect it. The anthem highlights the importance of securing tiger landscapes and an opportunity to come together to secure a future for tigers and their vast wild spaces - to benefit wildlife, people and our climate.

 

Viswanathan Anand and his son Akhil, a young nature enthusiast, conducted a Tiger Quiz as an awareness initiative to share exciting facts about the big cat and enhance knowledge about tigers for kids to actively support tiger conservation. Vishy, along with all the kids present, pledged to protect tigers and advocate the importance of adopting eco-friendly habits in our daily lives at school and home to reduce pressure on natural resources.
