Moradabad: An interactive workshop with senior Government officials was organized by District Administration of Moradabad in partnership WWF-India to discuss ‘Village Selection for Joint Demonstration towards Ramganga Conservation’. The meeting which saw active participation by Government officials was spearheaded by Shri. Sanjay Kumar, District Magistrate of Moradabad along with Shri. Faizal Aftab, Chief Development Officer and Dr. Ombvir Singh, Deputy Director, Agricultural Department. Other Government officials included District Forest Officer, Moradabad, District/Gram Panchayat members, Executive Engineers from various Line Departments, several Block Development Officers, Groundwater Officials and members of the Minor Irrigation & Agricultural Department. 



The workshop was inaugurated by the District Magistrate Shri Sanjay Kumar along with Chief Development Officer, Shri. Faizal Aftab, who added, “This meeting is the initial step of the first collaborative effort for the river basin management. Synergized work plans and working together with members of the civil society and community groups is a key aspect of Ramganga revival strategy. The objective of the workshop is to discuss the criteria for selection of the potential villages for joint demonstration (WWF-India and District Administration), while identifying and exploring the potential for leveraging on existing Government schemes for taking forward the demonstration models.” Other participants of the workshop included subject experts including senior officials of WWF-India. 



“District Administration has been keen that the strategy designed to revive Ramganga should aim to combined effort of all the Government Departments coupled with public support through community participation. We have the privilege to have WWF-India helping us revive the river. The objective of the workshop is to identify few villages (minimum 15) on the banks of the Ramganaga where the existing Government schemes should be integrated with Ramganga conservation activities, making these stated villages into model villages, with a potential to be followed by others. We need all the government teams to work together. As part of the Ramganga’s revival strategy, we are also identifying and training master trainers who would conduct workshops in government schools. Government officials (like BDOs) would be working in partnership with local community members to form groups of Ramganga Mitrs and working on solutions. This is a very historic moment as you would be developing villages that would be setting an example for others to follow. The District Administration would also be felicitating those government officials who would be actively participating and contributing in Ramganga conservation activities”, added Shri. Sanjay Kumar, in his key note to the workshop participants.



Mr. Suresh Babu, Director, River Basins & Water Policy discussed the agenda for the workshop while sharing various strategies adopted by WWF-India as a part of the Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga campaign, including establishing an Interpretation Centre on Ramganga, developing a Ramganga documentary along with working with diverse local communities aiming to revive the river. “The key word is synergy, which is imperative to be developed along with community mobilization. Together with the District Administration of Moradabad, Ramganga’s revival strategy aims to highlight in the selected villages that river is an integral part of all our lives and it should be able to influence/inspire people from neighboring villages.”

The workshop saw the Chief Development Officer constituting a working group, comprising –Block Development Officers of all Moradabad blocks, officials from Agricultural Department, District Development Officer, Groundwater Department Officials, experts from WWF, Forest Department, Basic Shikhs Adhikar (BSA) etc. to further shortlist the villages and initiate the stated joint demonstration activities. The proposed date for the next meeting of the working group is September 4, followed by the visits to the shortlisted villages up till September 10.
