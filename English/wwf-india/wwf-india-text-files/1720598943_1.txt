Narora, Uttar Pradesh:  WWF-India culminated its month long awareness drive through Ganga Mahotsav, at Narora (Bulandhsahar-UP). This is where WWF- India began its work with the local communities for the conservation of Ganges River Dolphin and the Ganga in 1997. This campaign is highly popular and has record participation of local communities in this region. 



This year too, the Ganga Mahotsav was observed on October 5th as a part of the Wildlife Week celebrations. Various events were organised every day with a participation of around 15,000 school children and villagers from the surrounding areas. These activities included street plays, film screenings on River Dolphins, public meetings of the village administration and general public. This series of events concluded today with a rally which saw the participation of approximately 2000 students and local people who conveyed their support for the conservation of this species and the River. 



The ‘Ganga Mahotsav’ is a part of WWF-India’s Living Ganga Programme which looks at the issue of depleting freshwater resources in the light of climate change. Supported by HSBC Bank, the programme has been extremely active in Kanpur where several on-the-ground interventions have made significant difference in the river system.



WWF-India has prioritized the conservation of its flagship aquatic species and habitat. These include River Dolphin, Otters ,Gharials and fresh water turtles. Under the River Dolphin project, WWF- India works on three species of Dolphins, namely- Ganges River Dolphin (in the Ganga River and its tributaries), Indus River Dolphin (In the River Beas, Punjab) and Irrawaddy Dolphin (in Chilika Lake, Orissa). On 5th October 2009 the hon’ble Prime Minister of India had declared the Ganges River Dolphin as India’s National Aquatic animal.



The Ganges River Dolphin was once present in tens of thousands of numbers which has dwindled abysmally to less than 2000 during the last century owing to direct killing, habitat fragmentation by dams and barrages, indiscriminate fishing and pollution of the rivers. Listed by IUCN as 'endangered' and placed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the Ganges River Dolphin enjoys high levels of legal protection, both nationally and internationally. The absence of a coordinated conservation plan, lack of awareness and continuing anthropogenic pressure are posing an incessant threat to the existing Dolphin population. In a workshop held in Samarinda, Indonesia, in October 2009, it was decided that October 25th be obeserved as World Dolphin Day. This workshop saw the participation of IUCN Cetaceans Specialists Group along with leading Dolphin conservation organizations. As one of the leading Dolphin conservation organization, WWF globally lent its support and observed the same, this year too.  



WWF-India adopted the Ganges River Dolphin as a species of special concern. This program was initiated to build a scientific database of the population status of the species and study the habitat quality of the dolphins' distribution range.



WWF-India has been working closely with various government departments, specially State Forest Departments ,local NGOs, scientists, researchers and universities to ensure the implementation of the action plan through capacity building and carry out conservation awareness and education activities. A River Watch Programme has been initiated to identify hot spots and develop management plans with the help of the Forest Department and create awareness in target areas. WWF-India has been working towards designating an international status like the 'Ramsar site' or 'Community Reserve' for these hot spots. 



Speaking on the occasion Dr Parikshit Gautam- Director Fresh Water and Wetlands said” The dolphin is very critical for the Ganga to monitor the health of the river and maintain its ecosystem. WWF-India would like to thank the UP forest department for the role it has played in ensuring the conservation of these species. WWF India will continue to contribute towards esuring the survival of these species. Conserving the Ganges River Dolphin
