Sharing the connection between wildlife and nature for Earth Hour through a live graffiti event



New Delhi: This year, WWF’s Earth Hour campaign encouraged individuals, communities and businesses to give an Hour for Earth. To build momentum, the WWF-India Delhi office hosted Pedal for the Planet cylcothon, which saw participation by 500+ people, including school kids, homemakers, youth and even the elderly. The main focus of the cylcothon event was to mark Earth Hour and encourage people to give their 60 minutes to the planet by doing something positive and sustainable. HSBC, BYCS India Foundation and EPAM supported pedal for the planet.

 

The Delhi cylcothon was flagged off by Ms Nandini Bhatnagar – EPAM – Director Marketing, who has supported cyclothons in Delhi and Hyderabad, Dalip Singh Sabharwal, the Delhi Bicycle mayor for BYCS India foundation and Mr Karan Bhalla, COO, WWF-India. Karan thanked BYCS for their instrumental support and guidance in making these cyclothons possible pan India in 13 cities for Earth Hour 2023.

 

Another attraction for the day was the live graffiti event by a famous mural artist and graffiti painter Arnab Sikder and his team. They brought the focus on wildlife which is an integral part of our nature. It is important that this Earth Hour, while we pledge to do something positive for the planet, we consider our wildlife too and pledge to protect them and their habitat. Arnab's work has been featured in a variety of contexts, including murals for Start India, Royal Enfield, and the Guwahati ecological museum-state zoo, to name a few.

 

Arnab shared, “I am delighted to be a part of WWF-India's Earth Hour to spread the message about protecting our planet through my art. Nature has always been an inspiration in everything I do. My art flows better when I am able to connect with my surroundings.”

About Earth Hour 

Earth Hour is WWF's flagship global environmental movement. Born in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has grown to become the world's largest grassroots movements for the environment, inspiring individuals, communities, businesses and organizations in more than 190 countries and territories to take tangible environmental action. Historically, Earth Hour has focused on the climate crisis, but more recently, Earth Hour has strived to also bring the pressing issue of nature loss to the fore. The aim is to create an unstoppable movement for nature, as it did when the world came together to tackle climate change. The movement recognizes the role of individuals in creating solutions to the planet’s most pressing environmental challenges and harnesses the collective power of its millions of supporters to drive change.
