WWF India believes that the three of its volunteers who were abducted from Chirang Forest Division of northeast Indian state of Assam will be released unharmed. This conviction has been strengthened by the many appeals put forwarded by prominent conservationists and other groups from across the state and country. WWF India has also made an appeal to the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India seeking his intervention to secure the release of these student volunteers. 



We are continuing to work closely with the Assam state government authorities for resolving this crisis as quickly as possible. 



WWF India specially thanks the families of the abducted boys, who, despite their ordeal, have shown extraordinary courage and patience. WWF staff members have been meeting and talking the boys’ parents and family members regularly.
