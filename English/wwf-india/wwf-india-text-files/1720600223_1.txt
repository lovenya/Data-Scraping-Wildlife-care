Ranthambhore: Restoration efforts were initiated on an eight-hectare  patch of panchayat (community) land falling in the Ranthambhore-Ramgarh corridor,  adjacent to the Indragarh range of Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (RTR),   with the plantation of about 1000 indigenous trees in the first week of August 2015.



The plantation drive is part of WWF-India’s long term initiative to restore several such corridors that link Ranthambhore to other existing and potential habitats, within the landscape. The drive was undertaken with the support and active participation of the people of Antarda village, especially the village’s eco-development committee, and the forest department.



Fast growing invasive species  such as Prosopis juliflora have long displaced native species in this landscape, and contributed  substantially to land degradation. The spread of invasive species especially over panchayat land and lands under the jurisdiction of the revenue department has led to increased pressure on forest lands for grazing. Loss of native vegetation and degradation threaten to sever corridor connectivity. The afforestation drive is an initial step towards addressing the threat.     



 Saplings of plant species  such as Indian gooseberry or amla (Emblica officinalis), bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus), sacred fig or peepal (Ficus religiosa), dhonk (Anogeissus pendula), siris (Albizia lebbeck), aashta (Bauhinia racemosa),  khejri (Prosopis cineraria), reonjha (Acacia leucophloea),  neem (Azadirachta indica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), ashoka (Saraca asoca) and mango (Mangifera indica) were obtained from a local nursery of forest department at Talwas, Indragarh range (RTR), Aalanpur and a WWF-India  supported nursery at Basso Khurd, Sawai Madhopur.



A well planned and systematic restoration of all the corridors is planned over the next three years. Degraded forest and other lands will be identified across the corridors; their ownership and present land use will be properly mapped and understood; and, support from local communities, the forest department and other stakeholders will be solicited and harnessed in order to ensure success for the corridor restoration effort.
