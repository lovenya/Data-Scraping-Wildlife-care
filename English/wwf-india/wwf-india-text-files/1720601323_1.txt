Earth Hour 2023 will be celebrated on 25th March from 8:30 pm onwards, worldwide.



New Delhi: Earth Hour is WWF’s flagship annual event that provides a collective moment of optimism to celebrate our one shared home and to raise awareness for addressing the dual biodiversity and climate challenges that the planet is facing. 



WWF-India's aims to reach an even larger audience and gain support towards achieving a nature-positive world.  It’s Goodwill Ambassadors, for Earth Hour India 2023 will play a key role in assisting with this endeavour. 

In addition to the campaign's historic "switch off" tagline, the Goodwill Ambassadors will encourage all to go beyond switching off non-essential lights to also switch off from everyday actions that impact our planet – for people to reconnect, learn and inspire others to take care of the planet.



Sudarsan Pattnaik, a world-renowned Indian sand artist and Padma Shri Awardee, has been spreading the message of protecting the environment and nature among many other social causes. As a Goodwill Ambassador for Earth Hour India 2023, he shares, “It is a great opportunity for all of us to join the global movement this Earth Hour and work towards creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly future for generations to come. I urge you all to join me on 25th March to spread the message far and beyond, to compel more people to celebrate the hour and switch off in a different way.”



This Earth Hour, we will see celebrity chef and MasterChef India Judge, Ranveer Brar talk about his journey towards adopting sustainable food habits and his ideas on how we can avoid food wastage.



As a Goodwill Ambassador for Earth Hour India 2023, Ranveer shares, “This Earth Hour, when we switch off all our non-essential lights, we should cook one dish that our grandmothers used to cook using the ingredients that we would normally waste today, like ‘melon seeds ki panjiri’ or ‘pickle or chutney of the skin’. This would be a good way of going beyond the hour this year.”



Earth Hour India 2023 Goodwill Ambassador Nakash Aziz, a renowned composer and singer, has composed and sung the Earth Hour India jingle—a song for everyone to share their love for nature and the need to protect it. 

 

Nakash shares his experience while writing and singing the song, “It is great to be associated with WWF-India and Earth Hour 2023. I appreciate the fact that they do so much to spread awareness about nature and our planet as a whole. I hope we can make a difference in bringing whatever positive change we can for our planet. My contribution to the Earth Hour jingle is a step forward in the direction.”



Karan Bhalla, COO, WWF-India said, “I thank our Earth Hour India 2023 Goodwill Ambassadors Sudarsan Pattnaik, Ranveer Brar and Nakash Aziz, for their valuable support to the global movement. Their association with Earth Hour this year, through their specific mediums of expertise will help us inspire a larger audience in unique ways to create the Biggest Hour for Earth.”
