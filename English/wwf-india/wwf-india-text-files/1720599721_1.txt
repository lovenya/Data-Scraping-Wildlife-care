WWF-India’s Satpuda Maikal Landscape (SML) programme, based in Mandla in Madhya Pradesh, has been working with school children since 2007 when the ‘Bal Panchayat’ (Children’s Council) was initiated. The council has helped the programme create positive awareness about conservation among the youth in the Kanha-Achanakmar corridor, a critical tiger corridor in Central India. A modified version of this initiative was also launched in the equally important Kanha-Pench corridor in the form of a nature club. So far, six nature clubs have been successfully formed in SML.



The members of Green Chhatisgarh, Rajbainda and Shivaji nature clubs took up tree adoption in Bhimdongri School where the children adopted over 30 trees around the school premises. Complementing this, the nature club members of Rajbainda provided 200 fruit bearing saplings to 60 households of the village for tree adoption.



Similarly, a water harvesting initiative: ‘Bori Bandhan’, was taken up by members of Green Chhatisgarh and Jhirpani nature clubs in the streams of Jhiriya and Rajbainda villages. This activity was supported the Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh Forest Departments, the Education Department, Tribal Welfare Department and media personnel and has positively helped in storage of water which can be used for drinking purposes for cattle and wildlife as well as for irrigation.



Mr. Sundar Das Panariya, Head Master of Rajbainda Middle School, after the event of Bori Bandhan said, “I thank all the nature club members for doing this fabulous job which is a source of inspiration for the villagers that small ideas can create wonders. No matter wherever we are we should keep on doing these sort of activities for supporting conservation work”.



The nature club members of Seonikala and Rajbainda also undertook a transect walk of Chilpi and listed the flora and fauna of the area. They also organised an anti-plastic awareness campaign to change usage behaviour among the local villagers.



“The nature clubs are meant to create an informed and aware force of young ambassadors to spread our conservation message to the masses. I am sure the effort will help develop positive socio-political will, ensuring harmonious coexistence between man and wilderness,” said Dr. Chitranjan Dave, Landscape Coordinator, SML, WWF-India.



Activities and initiatives such as these by the nature clubs, supported by WWF-India, are slowly but steadily creating a positive impact locally and are helping to build more support for nature conservation.
