An awareness, outreach and involvement drive



New Delhi: WWF-India and Religare Art in association with Taj Palace, New Delhi unveiled ‘Conservation on Canvas’ – an Art Exhibition that captures the critical issues of environment conservation, bringing to life the splendid and myriad colors of nature and its intricate relationship with human beings. Renowned artists of India came forward to join hands with WWF-India to support the cause of conservation. The exhibition was unveiled at Masala Art, Taj Palace, New Delhi.



Curated by Religare Art, ‘Conservation on Canvas’ creates an opportunity to bring together various stakeholders such as the government, corporate and individuals supporters, celebrities, creative agencies, media and the world of art, on one platform working towards a common mission of leaving a living planet for future generations with WWF-India.



According to Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, “Initiatives like ‘Conservation on Canvas’ provide us with an innovative platform to engage with a wider audience, to generate awareness and spread our message of conservation. It is inspiring to see so many renowned artists come forward to support this cause. We understand the necessity to broadcast the message of conservation in many and creative forms and this in one such initiative. We thank the artists contributing and those bringing this event together.”



“One of WWF India's main objectives is to spread awareness and garner support for conservation, through mediums which are effective and impactful. When eminent artists of India and Sri Lanka joined hands in our initiative, to paint for the cause and share their works on nature, there could not have been a better harmony between the colours from a brush and the canvas of nature bringing ''Conservation on Canvas'' to life.

 

This project will support three focal programmes of WWF India - Study and research the habitat of selected aquatic fauna, understanding the crucial role played by forest corridors and the threats they face in the different tiger landscape complexes in India and the protection of smaller and not so glamorous species which are equally endangered and some critically on the verge of extinction.”, stated Ms. Madhur Das, Director – Conservation Alliances, WWF-India.



The key objective of ‘Conservation on Canvas’ is to create awareness and garner involvement and support for WWF-India’s conservation programmes. The uniqueness of the project is that it is an ongoing campaign. This innovative campaign will catch the attention of interested audiences, through art forms that inspires them to join the cause.



Mr. Amit Sarup, President, Religare Art concluded, “Artists, collectors, corporates and people at large are all getting more conscious about the environment today and are doing their bit for its conservation. This association of Religare Art – a 360 degree platform for the arts, with WWF- India not only gives us an opportunity to do our bit for this cause but is also a great platform for us to showcase distinctive and thematic artworks from talented artists that resonate well with our clients.”



‘Conservation on Canvas’, the Art Exhibition, will be on display for public viewing at the Religare Art Gallery, D3, P3B, District Center, Saket, New Delhi – 110017 from the 20th April till the 11th May 2012. 



Focus programmes supported by ‘Conservation on Canvas’:

Three focal WWF-India conservation programmes have been identified that are in need of immediate attention. These are:


Freshwater Riverine Species: Freshwater species and habitats, on an average around the world, are more imperiled than their terrestrial counterparts. The objective of this Freshwater programme of WWF-India is to study and research the habitat of selected aquatic fauna; such as River Dolphins, Otters, selected species of Turtles, Sarus Cranes and the Gharials. WWF-India has initiated several projects for the conservation of these freshwater species.
Corridor Protection in Landscapes: Corridors are essential for animals to disperse between source populations, thereby allowing genetic and demographic exchange between populations and facilitating ecological processes that have evolved over thousands of years. Understanding the crucial role played by corridors and the threats they face, WWF-India has been working in critical corridors in the different tiger landscape complexes in India.

WWF-India’s work includes working with local communities living in the corridors to secure and develop sustainable livelihoods, providing alternate energy sources, education and outreach work, research and monitoring of tigers co-predators and prey, and guiding policy interventions in the landscape based on our work.
Other Endangered Species: WWF-India is known to protect the flagship endangered species including the glamorous animals such as the tiger, elephant and the rhino. But, what is little known is that we also work with a lot of other species who are equally endangered and some critically on the verge of extinction. WWF-India has launched a ‘Save the Smaller Species’ drive. Smaller species, often neglected, form the backbone of the food chain. Placed at the bottom of the food chain, an abundance of small species signifies a healthy eco system.

The other endangered species include the Nilgiri Tahr, Red Panda, Black Necked Crane, Sparrow, Great Indian Bustard, Snow Leopard, Golden Langur and the Asiatic Lion
