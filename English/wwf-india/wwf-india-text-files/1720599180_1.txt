“Taking Responsible Tourism to the Himalayas” 



Thimphu, Bhutan: WWF’s Green Hiker Campaign was formally launched in Bhutan on September 27, 2011 on the occasion of World Tourism Day. The event was organised in collaboration with the Nature Recreation and Ecotourism Division, Department of Forests and Park Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, and the Association of Bhutanese Tour Operators. 



Following the launch, the event participants were taken on a guided tour of the Royal Botanical Park in Lampelri, the first recreational park in Bhutan. This was flagged off by Mr. Kesang Wangdi, Director General, Department of Tourism, Ministry of Economic Affairs. The participants were guided by the park staff along the Rhododendron Garden trail and Sherichhu nature trail. The launch saw the participation of hikers, trekkers, pilgrims, tour operators, hoteliers and students, all in support for the campaign. 



Green Hiker is a part of WWF’s Saving Wetlands Sky-High! initiative which is working to conserve Himalayan high altitude wetlands in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and China. The campaign aims to raise awareness about the vulnerability of the Himalayan ecosystem and its wetlands, and to encourage tourists and tour operators to adopt ‘responsible’ tourism practices, which would help reduce the negative impacts of tourism. Already running successfully in India and Nepal; Bhutan has now joined the league as well. Green Hiker is hoped to launch in Pakistan and China soon, making it a truly regional campaign.



Bhutan, being gifted with pristine environment, unique culture, and inimitable philosophy of Gross National Happiness is attracting hundreds of tourists from all over the world. Moreover, tourism has been prioritized as one of the leading income generating sectors in the country, and the government has already estimated around 100,000 tourists by the end of 2011. This puts Bhutan’s forests and fragile high altitude Himalayan ecosystems at risk, especially from unsustainable human activities. The Green Hiker campaign thus, becomes relevant to Bhutan and its flourishing tourism industry.



“Bhutan has huge potential for the tourism industry, and is being harnessed well up till now. Sustainable tourism that balances both the country’s development aspirations and protection of environment is what we need to look at in times to come. Through this campaign, WWF urges all to negate any detrimental impact that tourism may have on the environment by practicing responsible tourism” said Mr. Vijay Moktan, Conservation Director, WWF Bhutan. 



“As Bhutan stands on the threshold of becoming a more popular tourist destination, it is in the best interest of the nation to lay the foundation of a more ‘responsible’ kind of tourism to begin with, in order to safeguard its rich natural resources. It should be the responsibility of every citizen, tourist, government department and tour operator to keep the sacred Himalayas clean and pure, just as nature presented it to us,” said Ragini Letitia Singh, Regional Communications Officer, Regional Programme for Himalayan High Altitude Wetlands Conservation, WWF-India, while speaking at the launch.
