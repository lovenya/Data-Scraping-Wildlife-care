Awards celebrate the upcoming launch of the 2022 Lunar Year of the Tiger - the target year of the global goal to double wild tiger numbers set in 2010

 

25th Jan 2022 - India’s Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) has been awarded the prestigious TX2 Awards after its tiger number doubled since 2010. The Nilgiri biosphere landscape that this reserve is part of, is currently the home to the largest tiger population in the world.

 

The awards are presented by the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS), Fauna and Flora International (FFI), Global Tiger Forum (GTF), IUCN’s Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme (ITHCP), Panthera, UNDP, The Lion’s Share, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and WWF. They celebrate the 10th anniversary of all 13 Tiger Range countries committed to double the global population of wild tigers by 2022. The award acknowledges the efforts by the state governments and the local communities who have played one of the most important roles to turn a relatively new tiger reserve into one of the source populations of tigers in India.

 

Sathyamangalam was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2013 and now has about 80 individuals in the area. The tiger reserve is an important link between the Nilgiris and Eastern Ghats landscape. It is connected to other well-established tiger habitats like Mudumalai Tiger reserve, Bandipur Tiger reserve and BR Hills tiger reserve. The adjoining areas like Erode forest division, Coimbatore forest division and Malai Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary are also emerging as important tiger habitats, creating a mosaic that allows the big cats to easily move in search of food and new territory. 

 

Mr Ravi Singh, Secretary-General and CEO, WWF India, said, “The TX2 Awards celebrate the remarkable contributions made by government bodies, NGOs, and local communities to strengthen tiger conservation. To honour a recently notified Tiger Reserve like Sathyamangalam with the award is a step forward to inspire others to work towards preserving this magnificent species and its habitats.”

 

In September this year, tiger range countries will convene at the second Global Tiger Summit in Vladivostok to assess progress towards the ambitious TX2 goal - double the number of tigers in the wild - and identify tiger conservation priorities for the next 12 years.

 

Apart from the STR, the Bardia National Park in Nepal has won this year's TX2 Award for doubling the population of wild tigers since 2010. A second award for Tiger Conservation Excellence is presented to the Khata Forest Conservation Area in Nepal, which secures transboundary connectivity for tigers between Nepal and India. 

 

The Khata corridor where community-based conservation efforts, including a network of 74 community forests covering 202 km2, have secured safe passage for tigers between Bardia National Park in Nepal and Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in India. Over the last five years, 46 individual tigers have been detected using the corridor with other iconic and threatened mammal species, including the Asian elephant and the greater one-horned rhino.

 

Stuart Chapman, Lead of WWF’s Tigers Alive Initiative, said, “The commitments made in 2010 demonstrate what can be achieved through long term commitments to tiger conservation.

The dedication of field teams, conservation partners and communities living with tigers are behind these extraordinary results.”

 

Sugoto Roy, Coordinator of the Integrated Tiger Habitat Programme, IUCN, said, “Successful tiger conservation involves continuous management and improvement of habitats at the landscape scale, rigorous monitoring of tigers and their prey, and working extensively with local communities. All of these criteria have been met with excellence, giving us these globally significant results.”

 

***

The TX2 goal is one of the most ambitious conservation goals ever set for a single species, and the second Global Tiger Summit in Vladivostok, September 2022, offers the opportunity to set a new vision to secure their future. 



Tigers numbered perhaps 100,000 a century ago but dropped precipitously to as few as 3,200 in 2010. Their numbers have slowly recovered to approximately 3,900, based on estimates from tiger range countries compiled in 2016.
