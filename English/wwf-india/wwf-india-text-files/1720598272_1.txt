WWF welcomes India becoming the newest member of the US-led Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking (CAWT), a coalition that promises to collaborate in the fight against illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife parts. 



“For the first time India and the US have come closer to dealing with issues related to conservation," said P.K. Sen, Director of WWF-India's Tiger and Wildlife Division. "We hope this agreement saves some of our tigers, elephants, rhinos, otters and other wildlife.“ 



India and the US also agreed to exchanges of park and customs officials regarding public education about illegal wildlife trade, wildlife and national park management, local involvement in eco-tourism and human-animal conflict. 



"Conservation in our country is being threatened to a large extent by rampant poaching and clandestine illegal wildlife trade," Sen added. 



"There is an urgent need to establish international law enforcement operations to ensure the survival of the tigers and other wildlife. India’s decision to join the CAWT makes it the Asian leader on tackling these perplex issues." 



WWF will support any effort to make the CAWT a success.
