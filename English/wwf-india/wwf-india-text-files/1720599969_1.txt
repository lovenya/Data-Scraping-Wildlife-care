Incidents of rhinopoaching have increased significantly in recent years, with the market value of rhino horn rumored to be greater than several precious metals and other contraband items. Two thirds of the world's great one horned rhino population resides in and around Kaziranga National Park's in the state of Assam and the park has also been no stranger to the increased attempts of poaching, several of which have unfortunately been successful. This increase in poaching has created a climate of despair; however, there still remains some hope, like this incident, that continues to restore our collective confidence in rhino conservation. 



On June 13 2014, five residents of Gamrighat village, located near Gohpur on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra River, spotted a rhino carcass on their way back to their homes following their fishing activities. The five men - Gangaram Sarma, Sabilal Gautam, Keshab Gautam, Sarminath Mala and Gopal Das foundthe carcass in close proximity to Pohumara Camp – a recently established anti-poaching camp of Kaziranga National Park (KNP).

The men, who are members of the Bonyaprani Suraksha Samiti and MatsyajeeviSurakshaSamiti, initially suspected that the rhino had been poached, but later realized that its horn was still intact, and had thus, likely died of other unknown causes. In an incredible gesture of commitment to conservationand respect for the animal, the villagers chose to inform the KNP authorities of the carcass, and took turns in patiently guarding it from would-be poachers until the authorities arrived. Localcommunities such as those living in villagessuch as Gamrighat on the fringes of Protected Areas are often in dire financial need, and the villagers could have quite easily chosen to profit by salvaging the horn and toes of the rhino. Instead, they promptly informed the KNP authorities,who arrived and collected the remains of the rhino, which were deposited at the Park headquarters.



This heartening display of empathy from the people of Gamrighat has encouraged WWF-India to establish long-term logistical support for human-wildlife conflict resolution for the community. Motivating and partnering with local communities to become stakeholders in conservation has been a hallmark of WWF-India's landscape approach to conservation, and communities like the people of Gamrighat are among the most receptive and beneficial to the conservation effort as a whole, owing to their feelings of kinship with their surroundings. Such communities are a perfect exampleof the benefits of working together to achieve harmony. 



"It is heartening to see thecommunity extend support to Kaziranga NP authorities. Such communities around Kaziranga deserve our support and help if we are to securethe wildlife in our PAs", said Tridip Sharma, Programme Coordinator for Kaziranga, WWF-India



The fact that wildlife continues to survive in parts of the country such as Gamrighat is a testament to the local residents' compassion and love for these creatures. In most instances, WWF-India invests a great deal of effort to assuage and discourage feelings of vengeance and retribution that emerge in local communitiesfollowing crop raids by animals such as elephants. There are also, however, cases of remarkably evolved mindsets in some communities, where localshave demonstrated an immense capacity for forgiveness on their own, such as in the case of elephants, who are sometimes affectionately referred to as “baba”, by these communities. Incidents such as the one at Gamrighat continue to inspire hope for the cause, as allies for conservation sometimes voluntarily emerge even in unlikely corners of the country, far removed from urban centres that are more exposed to messages of conservation.



"We felt that it was our duty and responsibility to inform the Kaziranga authorities about the carcass and guard the horn till the forest officials reached the spot. We were disappointed, however, that the Director or the DFO of Kazirangadid not call us and thank us for our support", said a group of thevillagers from Gamrighat.



It is essential that acts such as this do not go unrecognized, and WWF-India is working to ensure that this display of commitment is recognized.
