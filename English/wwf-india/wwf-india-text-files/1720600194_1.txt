WWF-India conducted a tournament for  in Sam village, the core area of Desert National Park, Jaisalmer. The tournament was held in partnership with the local forest department, and was intended to help bring about awareness and build support for conservation of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB).



The Great Indian Bustard is one of the largest flying birds in the world, and is found only in India. It was once widespread throughout the Western half of India, spanning eleven states. However, in the last three decades, its population has witnessed a drastic decline, and now the GIB is distributed across six Indian states, a majority being in Rajasthan. The Great Indian Bustard is considered the indicator of good health of the grasslands it inhabits. However, degradation of these grasslands, and conversion of this land mainly due to agricultural expansion is one of the biggest threats to this species, followed by illegal hunting, which is further aided and encouraged due to the lack of reporting of such cases by the local communities.

 

The cricket tournament spanned three days, wherein three one-day matches were held between six participating villages, namely, Sam, Ganga, Ghuriya, Neemba, Kanoi and Sagro Ki Basti.




 




WWF-India sponsored the prizes, which were distributed to the winning team by the Forest Department, and a special Man-of-the-match trophy was awarded as well. The event was attended by many including the elected leaders. The immediate goal of the tournament was to help break the ice and establish a relationship with the local communities in the region towards initiating discussions in the future on minimizing loss of habitat and hunting.
