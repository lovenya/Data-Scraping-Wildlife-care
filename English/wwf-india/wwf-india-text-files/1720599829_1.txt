New Delhi: The national finals of the Wild Wisdom Quiz were held today at the WWF-India auditorium in New Delhi. Held during the Wildlife Week each year, the quiz now in its sixth year, saw participation from over 25000 children across 565 schools from 44 cities in the country. This year’s Wild Wisdom quiz was won by Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, Chennai, followed by Bishop Cotton Boy’s School, Bangalore and Spring Dales Senior Secondary School, Amritsar in second and third position respectively. The Chief Guest for the event was Dr. Sadhna Parashar, Director Academics and Training, CBSE. 



The Wild Wisdom Quiz, an initiative of WWF- India and supported by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) is India’s only wildlife quiz at the national level. The quiz aims to provide students a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the wildlife of this country, build their interest towards the rich natural legacy and inspire them to work towards its conservation.



Keeping in tune with the International Year of Water, as declared by the United Nations, this year’s quiz highlighted the importance and conservation of water with 70% of the quiz focusing on water- related animals, birds, ecosystems, habitats and the various threats they face. As a continuation from 2012, this year too, the Wild Wisdom Quiz was available online, with students battling for a spot in the city level quiz as a wild card entry from the online version. Speaking at the event, Dr. Sadhna Parashar said “The Wild Wisdom Quiz provides students a platform to showcase and enhance their knowledge under a very unique sphere –wildlife. Even though we saw a large number of student participation this year, I would further urge students from all parts of India to be a part of this learning experience.” Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said “The Wild Wisdom is an exciting and participative platform for students across India to come together to compete at the quiz and gain knowledge through this interactive initiative. In its wider scope, the Wild Wisdom Quiz helps to foster the next generation of nature conservationists. We are grateful to our partners for their continuous support and to the many school for their participation towards our endeavor of conservation of our natural heritage.” 

The winners of the Wild Wisdom Quiz 2013 will now be taken on a trip to a snow leopard camp in Shivpuri, Uttarakhand. Supported by Adventure Nation, the camp aims to provide the students an opportunity to live amidst nature and witness it in full glory. The students will also take part in multiple adventure sports during this trip.
