New Delhi: TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network and a strategic alliance of WWF and IUCN, has issued an Advisory to various enforcement agencies in Bihar and other States asking them to take immediate action to curb nefarious and illegal wildlife trade activities at the Sonepur cattle fair held in Bihar.

 

Parakeets, hill mynah, bulbuls, doves, munias, shikra and many other protected species of Indian birds have been found on display at the fair, making it a major hub for illegal trade in bird species. TRAFFIC had observed at least 26 protected Indian bird species in the year 2014 and 18 in 2013.  Sales take place through the Chiriya Bazaar located at the fair.  

 

Sonepur fair is reportedly the largest cattle fair in Asia and has immense cultural and sacred significance. However, the fair is also seen as an opportunity by illegal wildlife traders openly to sell protected species of wildlife.

 

TRAFFIC’s investigation over the years have revealed several incidents of wildlife trade in violation of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972, clearly indicating that many aspects of the renowned fair are on the wrong side of the law. This year, the fair began on 25 November and will last for a month.

 

Rose-ringed Parakeet Psittacula krameri has been the most commonly seen bird species at the fair followed by Black-headed Munia Lonchura atricapilla, Red Munia Amandava amandava, and Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria with numbers ranging from 7000 individuals on display at a time to 2500 individuals. With trade in non-native (exotic) birds being used as a cover (owing to weaknesses in relevant legislation and policy) for the trade in indigenous birds, the extent of bird trade at the Sonepur cattle fair is most disconcerting.

 

TRAFFIC had also observed 37 Asian Elephants Elephas maximus at the fair in 2013, including six tuskers and six calves and 39 elephants including five tuskers and five calves in 2014. Capture and transportation of the elephants to Sonepur is a regular occurrence with reports confirming that many of these animals were transported from Assam to Bihar for sale at the fair in contravention of the law.

Rhesus Macaques Macaca mulatta and Hanuman Langurs Presbytis entellus were also found on sale along with other mammals such as the Black-naped Hares Lepus nigricollis, Nilgai Boselaphus tragocamelus and Indian Porcupine Hystrix indica.

Dr Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC in India says, “It’s unfortunate to see open violation of the wildlife laws at Sonepur fair year after year.  There is no doubt that the fair has evolved itself into a hub for illegal trade especially in indigenous bird species. TRAFFIC recommends coordination among various enforcement agencies such as the forest department and police in Bihar and other associated states for appropriate action to end illegal wildlife trade that threaten the future of many endangered and protected wildlife species”.

TRAFFIC’s Advisory recommends prohibition of elephants on the fairground premises of the fair and also recommends gradual phasing out of the display of elephants as well. Importantly, agencies need to maintain adequate checks on the animal and bird inventory at the fair, to ensure that no protected species are being sold. Efforts should be made to collect more data on wild animals traded and displayed at Sonepur. Continuous presence of effective wildlife law enforcement staff at the fair for the period of one month during the fair is significant to achieving this.

 

The Advisory also recommends publicity campaigns in and around the premises of the fair to educate the buyers about the legality of the trade and its legal implication on both the seller and the buyer.
