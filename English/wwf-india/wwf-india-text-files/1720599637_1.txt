Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, India: The 6th  consultative meeting between the governments of Nepal and India stressed on action to move forward the India-Nepal agenda for cooperation in biodiversity conservation. 



Dr S. P. Yadav, Deputy Inspector General of the Government of India’s National Tiger Conservation Authority said, “Bilateral meetings between India and Nepal have resulted in positive outcomes for wildlife conservation. Our governments need to continue strengthening trans-boundary ties for protecting tigers and enabling their free movement between India and Nepal.” 



The consultative meeting agreed on an eleven-point resolution that stressed on, amongst others, the joint monitoring of tigers in the Terai Arc Landscape, strengthening trans-boundary efforts in curbing poaching and illegal trade of wildlife and forest products, preparing tiger recovery plans for selected trans-boundary sites, pursuing proactive measures to mitigate human-wildlife conflict, promoting smart infrastructure development that does not adversely affect key wildlife habitat, and promote exchange visits to learn best practices in community participation in conservation. A committee at the central and field levels will be established and mobilized to help action the agreed resolution agendas. 



“This shared conservation landscape gives our governments common ground to work together to save wild tigers, which is a source of pride for us all,” said Mr. Bishwa Nath Oli, the Nepal delegation head and Joint Secretary of the Government of Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation.   



At present, there are an estimated 500 tigers in the Terai Arc Landscape, which also has one of the highest densities of tigers in the world. Stretching 600 miles across Nepal and India, the landscape allows tigers to disperse, conserving their natural behaviour, ecology, and genetic diversity. It has become a global priority for tiger conservation since its inception more than a decade ago. The shared monitoring results between India and Nepal will enable the development of a comprehensive management approach for tigers across the TAL for the first time. 



Mr. Rupak De, PCCF (Wildlife), Government of Uttar Pradesh said, “There are lots of challenges on both sides to address conservation issues. By working together, I believe we can leave a legacy for our children that we can be proud of.” 



Key participants of the meeting included senior officials from the governments of India and Nepal, protected area managers from both countries, Wildlife Institute of India and key NGO partners including WWF India and Nepal, National Trust for Nature Conservation and Wildlife Trust of India.
