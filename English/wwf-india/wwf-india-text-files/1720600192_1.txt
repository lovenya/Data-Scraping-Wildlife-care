New Delhi: A call for a paradigm shift of sorts in the way people, policy-makers and the judiciary perceive wildlife corridors and the need to formulate a comprehensive corridor management plan – were the two significant reflections from a two-day workshop on corridor management, hosted by WWF-India with support from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC), last week.

 

The workshop ‘Managing landscapes, corridors and connectivity for effective biodiversity conservation: Challenges and way forward’,­ aimed at highlighting the significance of wildlife corridors and their role in conservation was conducted on 18 and 19 June 2015. Hosted by WWF-India with support from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC), it brought senior forest officers from 12 states, legal professionals, wildlife and social scientists, GIS experts and conservationists on one platform to discuss strategies for effective corridor management.

 

Leading wildlife experts including Dr Rajesh Gopal, Global Tiger Forum; Mr. B.M.S. Rathore, IFS, Sr. Policy Advisor, ICIMOD; Dr A.J.T Johnsingh, renowned wildlife biologist and Sr. Advisor WWF and NCF; Dr. Sandeep Kumar Tiwari of Wildlife Trust of India, and others, participated in this interactive meeting.

 

Setting the mood for the debate on the first day, wildlife biologist Dr. Johnsingh gave an in-depth presentation on the wildlife of the Terai Arc and the Western Ghats, and the importance of corridors in landscape-level conservation. Explaining how each landscape was unique and was faced with a different set of problems, he pointed out that a watertight plan to protect the corridor would be possible only if each State is looked at differently.

 

In the ensuing sessions, status of wildlife corridors and the threats they were faced with across the country, were discussed. Among the impending threats were linear infrastructures, mining, unsustainable resource extraction, industrial and urban demands for land and resources.

 

Several concerns were raised: the need to involve people and communities in corridor management, the absence of a broad legal concept for corridor conservation, and the need to formulate a state-wise policy for corridors, were a few.

 

Adding perspective to the importance of corridors, Mr.B.M.S. Rathore, IFS, Sr. Policy Advisor, ICIMOD, conducted a simple exercise. Requesting participants to stand up and stretch out their hands for a few seconds, he asked them to share their views on the action. Responses ranged from “needed to adjust” to “encroaching into others’ spaces” and “openness”. Taking this simple exercise, he explained how sustainable development is possible if all stakeholders are willing to adjust and communicate (openness) and understand that they are encroaching into each other’s space. “We might be facing a losing battle unless we enlarge our support for conservation through incessant communication,” he explained.

 

The participants also mulled over concepts like the feasibility for non-profit organizations to raise Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds for land purchase, to secure corridors. The option of training ‘barefoot ecologists’ or communities for monitoring of corridors was also discussed. Summing up, the participants called for a proactive and forward-looking approach in corridor management.

 

On the second day of the workshop, Dr Rajesh Gopal reiterated the importance of communication by bringing up the need to involve various departments of the government, regional leaders and state authorities in corridor management. “The next step would be to hold several state level workshops and develop a charter of unanimously agreed rules, to ensure commitment. We need to motivate the local people, the primary stakeholders, to take a stand. The people can then motivate their leaders, who in turn could motivate their state ministers,” he said. He added that a multi-pronged approach is crucial for corridor management -- a system which includes short-term mitigation plans in regions facing immediate threats and a long-term strategy simultaneously.

 

  In the concluding session, a panel  comprising Dr Rajesh Gopal; Mr. JK Mohanty, APCCF, MP; Dr.A.J.T. Johnsingh; Dr. Sejal Worah, Programme Director of WWF-India; Dr Muthu Kumarvel, DCF, Golaghat and Mr. Sunil Panwar, DFD, Banerghatta TR discussed the need for a corridor management plan. It was agreed upon that the plan should be based on:

Precise mapping of all functional corridors
Assessment of current land use in the corridors and judging the feasibility of land use change that would take place in the corridor on a development pathway
Future vision based on green development strategy
Long term cost benefit analysis
Potential policy changes that are required for supporting corridor conservation, and
Scientific monitoring.

On a final note, it was observed that the stakeholders including the local communities, the urban public, the non-profit organizations and the conservation and scientific communities need to speak with one voice to ensure clarity on the issue.
