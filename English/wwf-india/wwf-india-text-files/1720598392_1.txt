To achieve goals for an India that is energy efficient and better adapted to climate change, WWF-India and Tetra Pak joined hands to launch the “Young Climate Savers” Programme – a series of workshops on climate change in schools across the country. 



The objectives of these workshops are: 



• To educate and motivate students across the country, to contribute in a meaningful manner in reducing the impact of climate change; 



• To inculcate leadership and motivation skills for promoting energy efficient lifestyles and eco-friendly attitudes. 



Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, speaking at the press briefing highlighted, “This is a unique initiative - first and possibly the largest single activity on Climate Change among students in India. The programme aims to reach over 50,000 students in 200 schools in one year and make them aware about the issues of climate change and the importance of energy efficiency. By reaching out to the younger generation, we expect to kindle the harbinger of new hope to mitigate this significant threat to our environment." 



Without doubt, Climate change is one of the most critical environmental challenges the world is facing today. The climatic changes that are taking place, and those that are predicted, are largely human induced: a small but growing number of people using too much resources and in an inefficient way. By burning fossil fuels inefficiently we release increasing amounts of Green House Gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere every year, way beyond nature’s capacity to absorb them through its natural processes. This has caused unprecedented levels of global warming leading to the problem of Climate Change. 



WWF’s recent publication ‘Climate Solutions: WWF’s Vision for 2050’ identifies key solutions and pathways for reducing the level of GHGs in the atmosphere in a planned and phased manner to avoid the probability of irreversible impacts of climate change. 



Peter Hane-Weijman, Managing Director, Tetra Pak India said "The tie-up between Tetra Pak and WWF aims at sensitizing young minds on this global issues and their contribution in saving the Earth through various educational programmes.Tetra Pak aims to reduce CO2 by 10% over a period of 5 years. We plan to achieve this by moving towards Green Energy. The tie-up is the first step towards this goal” 



Mr. Singh added “We are pleased to be associated with Tetra Pak India. We believe these workshops will encourage our future torch-bearers to take up a proactive role on this issue.”
