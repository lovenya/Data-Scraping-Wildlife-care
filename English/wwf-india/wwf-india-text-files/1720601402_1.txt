New Delhi, 20th March 2024: Ananya Panday invites everyone to be part of the largest global environmental movement, Earth Hour. She joins WWF-India as Goodwill Ambassador for Earth Hour India 2024 and shares, “Earth Hour 2024 is our chance to go beyond the iconic and symbolic switch off the lights and Give an hour for Earth. I’m giving an hour for Earth by planning more outdoor ventures to reconnect with the planet. Join me during this Earth Hour to take the tiny first steps towards living a more sustainable life. Be at the Earth Hour Festival on 23rd March at WWF-India HQ and witness the day-long event, full of sustainability and fun.”

 

The Earth Hour Festival is a day-long affair that includes conversations, art, food, photography, Oscar-nominated film screenings, and much more. This first-ever all-day conservation festival is part of WWF-India's efforts to turn a single Earth Hour into thousands of hours of action and awareness.

 

Join renowned artist Anjolie Ela Menon for an enriching live Painting Masterclass. Born in 1940, Anjolie Ela Menon is a celebrated contemporary artist known for her distinctive style and contribution to contemporary Indian art. Her work often combines realism with a touch of mysticism, creating a unique visual language. Participants of the festival will have the opportunity to paint alongside Menon as she creates one of her beloved animal motifs, a recurring theme in her iconic artworks. Don't miss this unique chance to connect with nature through art from 1:00-2:30 pm on 23rd March.

 

Wildlife photography is a great way to reconnect with the planet and every creature we share it with. Meet Latika Nath, also called the Tiger Princess of India, and Ismail Shariff, popularly known as the Snow Leopard Man of India, as they share insights into photographing elusive big cats. Join the Earth Hour Festival at the WWF-India office in New Delhi on 23rd March for an interactive session with Nath and Shariff.

 

The Earth Hour Festival will have an exclusive screening of ‘All That Breathes’, followed by an interaction with the producer, Aman Mann, and the human subjects of the documentary. The film received nominations at the 2023 Academy and BAFTA awards; it won awards at Cannes, Sundance, BFI London, IDA and Cinema Eye, and 24 other film festivals.

 

Other key attractions of the festival include an exclusive conversation between book authors Gargi Rawat and Neha Sinha, and a Nature Art Workshop that will help participants in observing the wonders of the natural world with an artist’s eye and expressing them on the page—with a pencil and watercolours alike—by Richa Kedia.

 

Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary-General and CEO of WWF-India, said, “WWF-India is hosting an exclusive Earth Hour Festival on 23rd March 2024, a day-long event on conservation, environment and sustainability, at its headquarters in New Delhi. Earth Hour is the world’s largest grassroots environment movement that urges everyone to spend 60 minutes for the planet’s future. The Earth Hour Festival intends to reinforce the campaign’s unique message that can make a significant difference to the health of the planet.”
