The pilot project of WWF-India’s programme Ek Prithvi was launched at the DIET office in Leh, Ladakh on March 16, 2016. The programme aims at building conservation leadership among students and teachers in Ladakh by raising awareness about their environment, engaging them in action for conservation and building positive attitudes towards sustainable lifestyle.



WWF-India’s Ek Prithvi has been implemented in Ladakh with the aid and support it received from the esteemed Thapar Public Charitable Trust.   



There are three publications developed under the programme for students, teachers and master trainers- Student Journal, Teacher Resource Book and Trainer’s Manual respectively. The Publications were released during the launch of the Ek Prithvi by Dr. Shah Faesal, Director of School Education, J & K State. The other dignitaries who graced the occasion were Sh. Prasanna Ramaswamy, Deputy Commissioner, Leh, Sh. Jigmet Takpa, IFS, CCF Wildlife Ladakh, Chief Education Officers and DIETs Principals of the Leh and Kargil district.



The event commenced with a formal welcome by Ms. Konchok Angmo, Principal DIET, Leh followed by a key note presentation by Ms. Radhika Suri, Director Education WWF-India. Ms. Suri in her presentation talked about WWF-India initiatives and various projects undertaken by the organization in Ladakh. She briefed the audience about various environment education programmes led by WWF-India across the country. She also expressed her gratitude towards Thapar Public Charitable Trust for the support extended by them for Ek Prithvi-Ladakh.

Students from various schools in Leh enthralled the audience with their scintillating cultural performances and added colours of joy to the whole event.



The Guest of Honour, Sh. Ramaswamy in his address emphasized upon inculcating the value of sacrifice amongst the children today ensuring that they grow more conscious about the impact of their actions on the environment and take informed decisions. The special guest Sh. Jigmet Takpa shared some alarming statistics on evolution and mass extinction and harped on the urgent need to conserve nature and its resources.

The event concluded with the address by Dr. Shah Faesal, the chief guest for the occasion. He shed light upon the traditional wisdom that prevailed in Ladakh since ages and emphasized upon reviving the folklores and legends that invoked respect for trees and animals and love for nature among the children. He also highlighted upon the significance of teachers becoming role models for their students. He acknowledged the efforts of WWF-India for introducing the programme in Ladakh and assured complete support from the state education authorities for its successful implementation. 



Post the launch, a two day training programme was conducted for 142 participants including teachers, DIET master trainers and pupil teachers from the Leh and Kargil district of Ladakh. The training was conducted by Ms. Radhika Suri, Ms. Neha Raghav and Ms. Chetna Singh Kaith from WWF-India. The objective of the training programme was to steer the teachers and trainers for implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the programme Ek Prithvi. 



Through the programme, 1200 students in 20 schools across the state will be reached out to and they will be engaged in conservational activities in and around their school.   The programme was well received by all in attendance. The teachers after experiencing the Ek Prithvi Learning Cycle through the Ek Prithvi-Teacher Resource Book believed that the programme will achieve success in meeting the objective of building conservation leaders in the region of Ladakh.



The teacher training concluded on March 17, 2016 and the participants were awarded the certificates of participation. Mr. Pankaj Chandan, Team Leader, Western Himalayas Landscape WWF-India proposed the vote of thanks and formally closed the training programme.
