Respect for human rights is key to the success of our work.



We are concerned about the inaccurate and misleading portrayal of WWF’s work and our relationship with local communities, the government and with corporates, in some sections of the media, over the last few months.



Much of our work is built upon sustained community engagement  in the landscapes where we work. We also work closely with the government authorities (across levels), civil society and community-based organizations, businesses and Institutions. We have strong policies to help ensure that both we and our partners recognize and respect rights and the well-being of tribal and local communities, for which we jointly find solutions that help mitigate environmental and social risks towards achieving positive conservation outcomes. Thus, inaccurate reports maligning our relationship with communities and businesses go against the grain of our fundamental approach to conservation.



We strongly refute these false accusations and stand steadfast in our mission to build a world in which people and nature thrive together.



We thank all our partners and associates who have stood by us and believed in our work over the years.
