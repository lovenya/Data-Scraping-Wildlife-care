Participating in Earth Hour is not just about committing for one hour on one day - it's about actively engaging every day to take care, in our small ways, of the one planet-home we all share. Everyday actions like saving water, sustainable living, reducing food wastage, eliminating plastics, and being energy efficient can help you go beyond the hour to shape a brighter future for people and the planet. 
 
Earth Hour celebrated this year on 26th  March is the largest global grassroots movement for the environment, every year brings together millions of people, businesses and leaders from around the world to shine a spotlight on the urgent need to address nature loss and climate change.

About Earth Hour 
Earth Hour is WWF's flagship global environmental movement. Born in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has grown to become the world's largest grassroots movement for the environment, inspiring individuals, communities, businesses and organizations in more than 190 countries and territories to take tangible environmental action. Historically, Earth Hour has focused on the climate crisis, but more recently, Earth Hour has strived to also bring the pressing issue of nature loss to the fore. The aim is to create an unstoppable movement for nature, as it did when the world came together to tackle climate change. The movement recognizes the role of individuals in creating solutions to the planet’s most pressing environmental challenges and harnesses the collective power of its millions of supporters to drive change. Earth Hour is kindly supported by Germany’s Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety with funding from the International Climate Initiative (IKI), as a part of the project “Scaling up Biodiversity Communication”.
