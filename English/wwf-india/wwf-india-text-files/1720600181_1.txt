Darjeeling: To celebrate the International  Day for Biological Diversity this year, WWF- India’s Khangchendzonga landscape team organised a biodiversity fair at Chowrasta in the heart of Darjeeling town on 22 and 23 May, 2015. The event was organised with the participation of organisations such as the Change Group, DLR Prerna, Himalayan Society for Nature and Science, Lanku Valley Organisation for Biodiversity Conservation, National Orchid Research Centre, NEPA, the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park and the Zero Waste Himalaya Group. Children from several local schools contributed posters and set up display stalls at the event.



Through this entertaining and interactive two-day programme, WWF-India sought to raise awareness among the local community about the wealth of biodiversity that is found in the Sikkim- Darjeeling region. Serious civic issues affecting Darjeeling, like the burgeoning garbage problem and how it threatens the biodiversity of the region, were also discussed. The event was organised as a component of Project SERVE being implemented by WWF-India in Darjeeling and funded by tea promoters Projektwerstatt Teekampagne.



The fair showcased three exhibitions on Sikkim, Darjeeling and the Himalayas according to the broad habitat types of the regions – subtropical, temperate and alpine respectively. Information on the habitat and various species that inhabit these regions was conveyed through colourful posters and paintings.



Hornbills and pangolins formed the main display for the subtropical habitat, while for the temperate habitat section, presentations and photographs of the red panda and rhododendrons of the region attracted huge crowds. The Snow leopard and the black necked crane along with a poster array on the alpine flowers made up the alpine section.



Some of the most popular displays included the butterflies stall organised by students of St. Robert’s School, Darjeeling. Interactive games, art and activities sections of the fair, including the red panda mask painting and bird painting counters, the quiz and puzzle games counter were also popular, especially among the young visitors.



Among the critical issues showcased was the agro-biodiversity stall, put up by partner NGO DLR Prerna. The section displayed the traditional food diversity of the region, and highlighted the linkage between traditional food and culture. Visitors were made aware of the nutritional values of traditional food varieties which are being lost rapidly in the face of changing consumer preferences. The zero-waste exhibition by the Zero Waste Himalaya Group generated significant interest in Darjeeling, which is grappling with a growing garbage problem.

The Biodiversity Fair was visited by over 800 students from various schools of Darjeeling, government functionaries, tourists and the general public.
