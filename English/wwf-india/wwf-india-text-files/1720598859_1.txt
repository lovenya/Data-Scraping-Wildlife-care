New Delhi: As the meeting of the Global Tiger forum (GTF) opened today, the governments of member Tiger Range Countries and other member countries showed greater desire to give an impetus to tiger conservation and steer the commitment forward.



There are 13 countries worldwide which still have tigers in the wild, although the numbers are very low. Without immediate strong action, the next few years will be catastrophic for wild tigers.



GTF is the only inter-governmental body representing countries that still have wild tigers, and it is responsible for facilitating, coordinating and strengthening these governments’ commitments and actions towards saving tigers in the wild. 



The two-day meeting at New Delhi has been convened to focus on developing a new strategy for the GTF, and to provide a platform for learning of conservation approaches across range countries and focussing on issues that can be replicated and scaled up, in efforts to galvanize political will and action to save the iconic species from extinction. Representatives from eight tiger range countries including India, renowned tiger experts from organizations working on the issue, like WTI, WPSI, WII were also present.



“GTF can play a lead role through close collaboration with tiger range countries and other organizations to check international hotspots of tiger trafficking, besides evolving a regional roadmap to strengthen global tiger conservation through respective National Action Plans, said Indian Minister of Environment, Shri Jairam Ramesh in his message. ‘The commitment from Tiger Range Countries is important at this juncture to revitalize and strengthen the forum. I appeal to all Tiger Range Countries for their active participation in this regard”, he added. 



Standardizing the methodology of conservation approaches on monitoring and habitat management, increasing law enforcement, linking critical area systems and looking at the issue of habitat fragmentation were the commonalities that emerged from among the initial discussions of the country delegates. The need to realize a sense of urgency and create awareness-raising campaigns, build capacities and tackle transboundary issues were the other pertinent points which will be discussed during the course of this conference.

 

“Development of a revised strategy for the GTF and a plan on governance and implementation are the two outcomes that will mark the success of this meeting, said HE Shri Deepak Bohara, Chairperson of GTF and Minster for Forests and Soil Conservation, Govt. of Nepal.



WWF-India, an organization that has a long history of initiatives for tiger conservation, dating back to the launch of Project Tiger in 1973, welcomed these new commitments for tiger conservation. “GTF being the only inter-governmental body for Tigers is ideally suited to offer a new paradigm for conserving this species among its range countries. We have no time to lose since the wild tiger population is at it’s tipping point”, said Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary Genera & CEO, WWF-India. “WWF remains committed to supporting range state governments as they take on this challenging task.” 



GTF was started in 1993 by tiger range states as a conduit for those countries to collaborate on a global plan for tiger conservation. Seven tiger range countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal and Vietnam) are members of the GTF as well as the UK along with some non-governmental organizations, including WWF and TRAFFIC. 



Tigers are particularly in the spotlight during this year which also happens to be the ‘Year of the Tiger’ in the Chinese lunar calendar. With possibly as few as 3,200 tigers left in the wild, WWF’s focus is on securing political commitments to double the wild tiger population by the next Year of the Tiger in 2022.
