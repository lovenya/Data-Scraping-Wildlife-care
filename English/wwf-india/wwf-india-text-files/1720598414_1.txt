WWF-India, one of the largest conservation organizations in the country, is proud to be associated with Mumbai Unplug - a voluntary campaign urging Mumbaikers to turn off the lights and unplug electrical devices for an hour on December 15, 2007 from 7.30 to 8.30 pm.
Inspired by the highly-acclaimed Earth Hour – initiated by WWF-Australia and a number of institutions, the activity aims to create greater awareness involving citizens and serving institutions of India's leading city in order to lead direct action addressing the climate crisis by turning off the lights. Numerous corporates, government institutions, not-for-profit and activist organizations have also come forward to pledge their support towards this initiative.



Speaking about Batti Bandh, Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, said, "Effects of Climate Change are being noticed in ecosystems across the country and Mumbai, being a coastal city, could be hit the hardest by rising sea water levels and a possible reduction in fish catch as a fallout of global warming. It is critical that all concerned citizens come forward and participate in this unique endeavor."



He added, "It is heartening to see a young group of concerned citizens come forward to address Climate Crisis. WWF-India encourages the spirit of responsible adventure and supports the pioneering spirit in bringing to the fore actions for betterment of the environment. We hope that this small yet powerful activity creates a greater understanding about Climate Change, and triggers larger actions by citizens and institutions to address global warming,"
