New Delhi: Syed Naushad Zaman, Gautam Kishore Sarmah and Pranjal Saikia, the remaining three WWF volunteers, were released unharmed this morning. They were part of the team of six volunteers who were abducted on 6 February 2011 near Ultapani in Western Assam. Earlier, on 8 February, three volunteers had been released. 



WWF-India thanks the Government of India, officials of the Government of Assam including those from the Bodoland Territorial Council, Police Department, Forest Department, District Administration as well as the armed and paramilitary forces who worked towards the release of our volunteers.



Throughout the crisis the people, the media and civil society of Assam showed unprecedented concern and stood together and appealed for the release of the volunteers. This confirms our faith in the people of the region. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the appeals of the All Assam Students’ Union, All Bodo Students’ Union and the Lower Assam NGOs’ Forum among others. We are overwhelmed by the widespread support from the civil society of Assam and across India during this difficult period. The media in its various forms provided its unstinting support and our special thanks goes out to them. 



We are thankful to the families of the abducted volunteers as well as the volunteers themselves, who, despite their ordeal, showed extraordinary courage and patience. WWF India thanks its team in Assam lead by Dr. Anupam Sarmah who worked selflessly for the safe release of these young people. We look forward to continuing our work for the conservation of nature and the ecological values of the region.
