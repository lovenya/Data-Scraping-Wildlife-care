Active engagement of multiple stakeholders is critical for the effectiveness of VSS

Posted on 08 April 2020

To help companies and industries make better production practices the norm, and help businesses become more sustainable throughout their supply chains, WWF-India supports the uptake of various Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS), such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

In a recent interview with Centre for Responsible Business, Bhavna Prasad, Director, Sustainable Business, WWF-India highlighted, the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach for VSS to be effective in moving the market. Industries, NGOs, think tanks and government stakeholders have supported various standards and certifications, such as those for palm oil, timber-based commodities, which has helped the standards evolve over the years.



A barrier facing the uptake of VSS is the premium price point, which many of them come at, making it difficult for smaller industry players, companies running on narrow margins to afford them, despite there being interest and inclination for the standards' uptake. Significant consumer interest in responsibly sourced and produced commodities is one way of ensuring greater uptake of voluntary sustainability standards.
