Background

Assam’s Udalguri district administered by Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) has seen a steady rise in Human Elephant Conflict (HEC) over the past decade. The district was in the news during 2009 when a total of 14 persons and 10 elephants died in the Dhansiri Forest Division, in and around the Bornadi – Neoli - Khalingduar Forest complex. Forest Department records show a total of 23 elephant deaths between 2003 and 2009 from this area, of which only four deaths were attributed to ‘natural’ causes. The rest were recorded as suspected poisoning, electrocution (both retaliatory and accidental), and falls into trenches. It was also observed that the cases of retaliatory killings of elephants went up in 2009 as human death figures also reached an all time high of 14. The North Bank Landscape (NBL) conservation programme of WWF-India has been carrying out a study in the area on the issue and the initial outcomes show a distinct shift in land cover pattern over the past decade. The unusual rise in number of causalities - both human and elephants (please see graph), can be attributed to this land cover change and forest degradation. 



Efforts by forest department and NGOs

Alarmed at the retaliatory killing of elephants, WWF-India advocated the release of an ex-gratia financial compensation for the affected families. The NBL programme extended its HEC mitigation activity to Udalguri and supported the Forest Department and the BTC to bring the situation under control. A number of awareness meetings were organized in the district and communities were sensitized on the issue. Pamphlets on ‘Dos & Donts’ during HEC situations and posters were used to effectively communicate this message to the communities living on the fringes of Bornadi Wildlife Sanctuary, Khalingduar Reserve Forest (RF) and Neoli RF. During the 2009 conflict season, NBL programme worked to implement short term measures to mitigate HEC. This was done in close collaboration with the Forest Department as well as civil society organizations of the district like Green Valley Forest & Wildlife Protection Society apart from student bodies and interested individuals. Basic support in the form of searchlights and noise creating devices were provided by WWF-India to the affected communities through the local NGOs. WWF-India intends to reduce the intensity of the current HEC levels and a mitigation strategy is underway with the Forest Department to ensure this.



Ex-gratia released for victims

In 2010, the Dhansiri Forest Division under the BTC extended a helping hand towards the people of the Udalguri district affected by HEC by releasing ex-gratia and compensation for injuries or damages to crop/ property caused by wild elephants. With the government distributing Rs. 5,89,000 for a period between 2002-2009, a total of 249 cases of injuries or damages to crop/ property were settled. Ex-gratia payment of RS. 9,99,000 was also released to 29 families who had lost their family members to wild elephant attacks outside forest areas during the same period. While Rs. 40,000 is paid in case of a human death, up to Rs. 20,000 is paid for every injured individual. In case of damage to crops, farmers are paid between Rs. 1,000 to 5,000. Also, property damage is compensated between Rs. 1,000 to 5,000.



In a meeting organized by the Forest Department on May 5, 2010 at Paneri, the cheques were handed over to the victims or the family members by Mr. Rihan Daimary, Minister (PHE), Ms. Komoli Basumatary, MLA, Mr. Mitharam Daimary, EM (BTC) & Mr. Santosh Kujur, EM (BTC). The Divisional Forest Officer, Mr. Bankim Sharma who was instrumental in the release of funds that were pending for almost a decade, expressed his satisfaction on the turn of events. The NBL programme was represented at the meeting by Dr. Anupam Sarmah and Mr. Hiten Kumar Baishya among others. Mitigating Human-Elephant conflict in Udalguri, Assam, India
