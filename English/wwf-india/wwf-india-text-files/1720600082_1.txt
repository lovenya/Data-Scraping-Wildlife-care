HSBC-India CEO along with WWF-India CEO and UP Forest Department released turtle hatchlings into the Ganges
More than 500 river turtle hatchlings were gently released by the senior officials from HSBC India, experts from WWF and riparian community members of Meerut District on the banks of river Ganga at Maqhdoompur Ghat, , where these hatchlings have a better chance to survive. The release has been a part of a collaborative turtle conservation project, jointly initiated by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department along with WWF-India in January 2013. The release day, which began early, witnessed HSBC India CEO, Mr. Stuart Milne, along with other senior delegates from the bank visiting the hatchlings in the Turtle Nursery in the Forest Department Training Centre. The delegates interacted with community members who signed-up to be Ganga Mitras and supported WWF in collecting 54 turtle nests from their farms, over a span of 4 months. The release event was attended by Mr. S.K. Awasthi, Conservator of Forests, Mr. Shushant Sharma, DFO – Meerut, experts from WWF-India including WWF-India CEO, Mr. Ravi Sing and senior officials from HSBC India.



The hatchlings, as old as 5 months were protected after WWF-India along with Uttar Pradesh Forest Department located a total of 54 turtle nests. 578 eggs were collected from the 54 nests located in the palage fields along a stretch of approximately 50 km of the river bank in the area. All the nests belonged to Batagur dhongoka. From 578 eggs, a total of 532 hatchlings survived; this records 92% hatching success. After retrieving them, they were given care and protection at the turtle nursery constructed by WWF-India at the Forest Training Centre at Hastinapur.



“Till couple of years ago, we used to throw away the turtle nest found in our farms. However after WWF’s intervention, we have started taking care of these turtle nests and regularly supporting WWF in this noble cause. These turtle hatchlings are like our children!”,said an enthusiastic Mr. Rajender Singh, one of the palage farmers from Maqhdoompur village.



In the Upper Ganga River, a total of 12 species of freshwater turtles have been identified. Of these, 6 species are considered endangered and listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Although turtles have been accorded legal protection, the laws are not effective in the field and their exploitation goes unabated. Further depletion in turtle populations is mainly due to habitat loss which is largely due to Palage (riverbed cultivation) and collection of sand from nesting sites. This also leads to loss of turtle eggs; which are also predated upon by human, stray and wild animals. WWF-India’s Rivers for Life programme has been working on conservation of 7 endangered and endemic species of the Ganga, including 3 species of freshwater turtles. In 2013, in-situ turtle conservation project was initiated by WWF-India. This project involves riparian communities (river bed cultivators) promoting them monitoring and conservation of turtle nests in their agricultural fields ensuring a sense of ownership and desire for stewardship towards biodiversity conservation. The year 2013 witnessed the release of 118 turtle hatchlings into the Ganga, number which now has increased 5 times.

“It's heartening to be part of this turtle conservation initiative and to witness the release of the turtle hatchlings which have increased five times since last year. Conservation is a complex process and this release today is a key milestone for HSBC Water Programme (HWP) and WWF India's partnership which was initiated in 2012. HWP is a 5-year USD 100 million global programme in partnership with three international NGOs, including WWF International. One of the key achievements of this initiative has been bringing together diverse stakeholders such as Government officials, riparian communities and students to take this cause of conservation forward”, said Stuart Milne, Group General Manager and CEO, HSBC India.



The nests which were collected by over 40 farmers from 8 villages along the Ganga have set a record by demonstrating community led conservation programmes.



 “This event promotes the involvement of riparian communities (especially river bed cultivators) by encouraging community-led monitoring and conservation of turtle nests in their agricultural fields, ensuring a sense of ownership and desire for stewardship towards biodiversity conservation. We hope that more number of hatchlings get release in the following year with large number of community members coming forward  to adopt this conservation initiative. Local administration plays a vital role in ensuring that these engendered species receive the much required protection,” said Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India. 532 Turtle Hatchlings released to Restore Ganga at Hastinapur
