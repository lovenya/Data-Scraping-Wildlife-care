WWF India launched its latest report 'Global Corporate Renewable Power Procurement Models: Lessons for India' at its event 'The Rise of Renewables: Are You REDE?' on 4th December 2019 in New Delhi.



The report assesses the progress of renewable power procurement in India while examining the current market framework and various challenges faced by C&I consumers. The report also reviews the global renewable power procurement options that are gaining traction in international markets the US, UK, and Australia, owing to the maturity of these markets, strong regulation, as well as growing consumer demand.



Virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), green tariffs, internationally tradable RECs (I-RECs), dedicated renewable power exchanges and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading have emerged as an attractive alternative procurement options internationally. However, some of these options are yet to be tested in India for their relevance and efficacy. WWF India launches new report on corporate renewable power procurement models
