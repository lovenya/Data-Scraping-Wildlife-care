Akhnoor, Jammu & Kashmir: With an aim to strengthen and capacitate the forest officials and frontline staff of the Jammu & Kashmir Forest Department, a week-long capacity building programme was conducted by WWF-India from 25-30 April 2016. Organised in collaboration with the State Forest Department, the programme was held in the Forest Training School at Doomi, Akhnoor.

 

The week long programme was facilitated by a joint team of WWF-India and forest officials acting as resource persons for the training. Inaugurated by the Hon’ble State Minister for Forest, Environment, Ecology & Wildlife - Shri Choudhary Lal Singh, the training programme was designed by WWF-India as per the requirements of the frontline staff of the J&K Forest Department.  

 

Sixty frontline staff, equipped with a special training kit, from various forest divisions across the state participated in the programme. The trainings aimed at orienting and capacitating the forest and wildlife guards on the operations and strategies employed by poachers and others involved in wildlife crime.  The key themes of the training included Protection and Patrolling, Basic Census Techniques, Human Wildlife Conflict, Wildlife Crime and Control, Legal issues and crime investigation.

 

Leading wildlife experts from across the country – including Dr. Rahul Dutta, International Rhino Foundation, Dr. RS Jasrotia, Chief Conservator of Forests - Working Plan, Training & Research, Sourabh Sharma, an independent lawyer; and WWF-India officials Dr. Pankaj Chandan, Harshad Karandikar, Shashank Srinivasan, Rohit Rattan and Pushpinder Singh Jamwal - trained the participants on various aspects of nature and wildlife conservation. In face of the increasing human wildlife conflict incidents in the state, focus was laid on capacitating the staff on understanding patrolling techniques and the need to give both short and long term responses. Sessions were also held on training them to document the presence of various water bodies inside the forests and on their protection. Another important session included training on detecting the advanced poaching techniques adopted by poachers and how to work on it.  

 

Speaking as the Chair in the concluding session of the programme, Shri AK Singh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Force in J&K, called upon the need to organize such well structured and effective trainings for frontline staff of each forest division on a regular basis. While addressing the participants, he said, “This training course has equipped the frontline staff with all the necessary skills which they require in their day to day activities inside the forests.”He also acknowledged WWF-India for conducting such trainings and hoped that more trainings of this nature will be organized in the near future. Dr. RS Jasrotia was of the opinion that regular trainings and refresher courses for the employees of forest department at all levels will make the department more effective and efficient in protecting the forests and wildlife.

 

By imparting such specialized training courses, WWF-India aims to protect the unique natural heritage of the state of J&K. It is hoped that the training programme will turn out to be an important step towards transforming the frontline staff in to a modern, well trained and well equipped force.
