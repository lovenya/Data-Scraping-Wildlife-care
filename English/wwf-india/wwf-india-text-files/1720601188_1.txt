Each year on 2 February, governments, non-governmental organisations and citizens around the globe celebrate World Wetlands Day to mark the date of the adoption of the Convention on Wetlands, on 2 February 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar (on the shores of the Caspian Sea). An intergovernmental treaty called ‘The Convention on Wetlands’ was signed in 1971 to provide framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. It is also called Ramsar Convention, named after the city Ramsar in Iran where it was signed. Wetlands of international importance are identified and given the status of Ramsar sites, these sites are recognized as of significant value not only for the country or the countries in which they are located, but for humanity as a whole.

 

“Wetlands and Biodiversity" is the theme for this year’s World Wetlands Day celebration, aiming at raising awareness about the importance of wetlands’ biodiversity. Wetlands are rich with biodiversity and are a habitat for a dense variety of plant and animal species and this year’s theme offers an opportunity to highlight wetland biodiversity, its status, why it matters and promote actions to reverse its loss.
WWF – INDIA’S WORLD WETLANDS DAY CELEBRATION, 2020 Highlights: 9 events Spread Across 4 States, Three Ramsar Sites
Uttar Pradesh



Haiderpur Wetland Bird Festival





WWF-India in collaboration with National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), Ministry of Jal Shakti and Environment, Forest and Climate Change Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh is organising a two-day bird festival event on the occasion of World Wetlands Day celebration in Haiderpur Wetland, Muzaffarnagar (Uttar Pradesh) from 2-3 February 2020.



During this event, activities such as bird watching, interactive session on bird identification and behaviour, drawing competition and quiz will be conducted focusing on this year’s theme “Wetlands and Biodiversity”. In addition, a technical session will also be conducted as a part of this event where subject experts representing governments, academia and NGOs will convene to discuss on the priorities for conservation and management of Haiderpur Wetland.

 

WWF – India endeavours to work towards protection of the Haiderpur wetland by developing an integrated management plan. The Conservation Planning Workshop scheduled during this Bird Festival event will be an important agenda where experts and stakeholders combined will be discussing on the conservation and management aspects of the wetlands.

ABOUT WWF – INDIA’S WETLAND CONSERVATION INITIATIVE

WWF – India recognises the crucial role of wetlands in a basin for maintaining the hydrological, geomorphological and ecological health of river systems along with the rich biodiversity they support. Through its Rivers, Wetlands and Water Policy programme, WWF – India aims to mainstream wise use of wetlands through an integrated participatory approach, combining science, policy and on-ground research.

 

WWF – India’s Integrated Participatory Approach towards Wetland Conservation:

Effective Management Of Ramsar Sites: 

Water quality assessments, Wetland Health Assessments (WHAs), biodiversity surveys (including bird, dolphin and gharial surveys)
Study on hydrology, catchment characteristics, spatial and temporal degradation of catchments and zone of influence
RMETT scoring and RAWES- tools aimed at improving the management effectiveness of the wetlands
Updation of Ramsar Information Sheets (RISs), preparation of Integrated Management Plans (IMPs), active engagement in management of Ramsar Sites  


Wetland Complexes In Flyways:

Development of model management planning framework for High Altitude Wetlands (HAWs) in the Himalayas
· Research on key wetland complexes falling on the Central Asian Flyway (CAF) including regular bird surveys and water quality assessments   


Conservation Of Urban Wetlands:

Inventorization and biophysical characterisation of urban wetlands
Preparation of brief documents for notification under wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017
Constituting and mobilising multi-stakeholder platforms to plan and implement conservation measure
Implementation of conservation activities like catchment area restoration, in situ water quality improvement measures, decentralised water treatment plants 


Integrating Wetlands In River Basin Management Plans

Ganga: Development of integrated basin management strategy with National Mission for Clean Ganga to conserve wetlands in the Ganga basin
Beas: Developing integrated basin management strategy focusing on high biodiversity value wetlands in the basin such as Harike, Kanjli, Nangal and Ropar.



Additionally, WWF-India  has been appointed as a focal point for Ramsar Convention’s Programme on communication, capacity building, education, participation and awareness (CEPA) in India.  Through its outreach and awareness programmes, WWF – India aims to create an institutional mechanism, bringing together different water users to discuss and collaboratively contribute solutions regarding water risk. The ultimate aim is that the communities will have the capacity and empowerment to advocate for change and emerge as prime change agents. With its Wetland Mitra initiative, the programme is has established a platform for bring together individuals from all walks of life contributing towards conservation and protection of wetlands in their neighbourhood along with NGOs. CSOs and the Governments. The Water Schools programme aims at nurturing young school children in the riparian community towards becoming sustainable water users and enhance their relationship with nature and biodiversity.



ABOUT WETLANDS

Wetlands are land areas saturated or flooded with water, permanently or seasonally. They are one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet and render many ecosystem services such as improvement in quality and quantity of surface and groundwater, protection against floods and droughts, nutrient recycling, as well as economic services such as livelihoods from fishery, livestock and forestry. They are also important biodiversity habitat. They can be:

Inland wetlands: marshes, peatlands ponds, lakes, rivers, floodplains, swamps, fens
Coastal wetlands: saltwater marshes, estuaries, mangroves, lagoons, coral reefs
Human-made wetlands: fish ponds, rice paddies, reservoirs, saltpans

Wetlands are declining at an alarming rate with more than 35% lost in under 50 years, a rate three times greater than that of forests. Overall available data suggest that wetland-dependent species such as fish, waterbirds and turtles are in serious decline, with one-quarter threatened with extinction particularly in the tropics. Between 1970 and 2014, populations of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles declined by 60%. Since 1970, 81% of inland wetland species populations and 36% of coastal and marine species have declined. 25% of wetland species are threatened with extinction, including waterbirds, freshwater-dependent mammals, marine turtles, and coral reef building species.



Wetlands must be at the heart of national and global biodiversity discussions, decisions and actions in 2020 – and beyond. Crucially, it is time to acknowledge wetlands’ critical role for biodiversity and the solutions they provide on climate change and sustainable development.

 

WETLAND AND BIODIVERSITY

Wetlands are rich reservoirs of biodiversity with 40% of the world’s plant and animal species living or breeding in wetlands. Over 100,000 freshwater species have been identified in wetlands so far and coastal wetlands, especially, are among the most biologically diverse places. Biodiversity loss denotes the unprecedented disappearance, degradation and unsustainable use of the ecosystems on which we and all other living things depend on to survive and thrive. Healthy, functioning natural wetlands are critical to human livelihoods and sustainable development. They offer powerful solutions for health, poverty, climate change and sustainable development as a whole. The source of our clean water, the rice that feeds 3.5 billion people daily and much of our fish, wetlands provide one in seven people with a living. WORLD WETLANDS DAY 2020
