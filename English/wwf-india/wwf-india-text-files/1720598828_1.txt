Awareness building among local communities living on the fringes of the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park in Assam has been identified to play a crucial role in garnering support for conservation and for protection of the wildlife in the park.



One such awareness program aimed at generating interest among school children towards wildlife and the Orang National Park was organized under the Indian Rhino Vision (IRV) 2020 program during April-May 2010. More than 250 students from Standard 3 & 4 (9-10 yrs age group) from 5 schools on the fringe of the Orang NP were part of the program.



In the first phase of the program, through the concept of ‘Learning by Doing’ the children were trained to draw pictures related to nature and wildlife. From this group the top ten students from each school were selected.



As part of the second phase, a second competition was organized on 16th May among the top ten students selected from each of the 5 schools. The idea of the competition was not only to find out the best among the students but to allow the young minds residing in different parts of the fringe of the park to mix and provide them a broader exposure about their own area as well as the national park. 



The students were provided an hour’s time to draw on the theme of rhino. Before this program not many of the children knew much about the animal or even attempted to draw it. During the competition it was noticed that there was a marked improvement in the drawing skills of the children with a few even coming out with commendable results. The drawings were then judged and prizes were given to the top 6 students.



As a follow up to the awareness building through art program short interactive sessions were held with students through screening of wildlife films and presentations from 18th May to 22th May. The interactive sessions reached out to more than 1000 students, 20 teachers and 200 parents in five schools on the fringes of the park.



Subsequently, through the request of the local villagers, awareness programs were also organized in two villages that reached out to over 200 villagers. 



This intensive wildlife awareness campaign organised on the fringes of Orang with support from the Assam Forest Dept. received positive response from the children, teachers, parents as well as the local villagers. It is hoped that through such programs children can be made aware about wildlife from a young age so that they can take more interest in conservation of the animals in the national park near which they live.
