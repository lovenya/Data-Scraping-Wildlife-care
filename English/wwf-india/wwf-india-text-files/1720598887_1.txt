Indulging in your desire to buy wildlife products could actually land you in trouble. Being the end consumer you are as much a partner in crime as the illegal wildlife traders or poachers. 



Illegal wildlife trade has caused large-scale damage to our wildlife, to the point where the very survival of certain species is now threatened.  



The most commonly known products in illegal wildlife trade in India include: Mongoose hair, snakeskin, Rhino horn, Tiger and Leopard claws, bones, skins, whiskers, Elephant tusks, deer antlers, turtle shells, musk pods, bear bile, medicinal plants, timber and caged birds such as parakeets, mynas and munias. 



THINK! KILL YOUR DESIRE TO INDULGE!



Did you know?

When you buy products such as statues, jewelry and other items made from ivory, you actually help pay for the slaughter of an elephant in the wild!



Did you know?

Two or three Chirus (Tibetan Antelope Panthalops hodgsonii) are killed to make one Shahtoosh shawl!



Did you know?

When you buy protected marine species and their products, you are actually buying souvenirs that contribute to the wanton destruction of our marine ecosystem!



Did you know?

A handbag, a pair of shoes, a watch strap or any other leather accessory that you buy may be made out of skin of a protected reptile species!



Possession of or trade in products/derivatives made of protected wildlife species is a criminal offence and is punishable by imprisonment of up to seven years and a hefty fine. 



It is with reference to this that TRAFFIC India, has released four Public Service Announcements (PSAs) as a part of its ongoing “Don’t Buy Trouble” campaign. The campaign targets domestic and foreign tourists, who genially buy souvenirs at the cost of the grisly treatment given to some of our endangered wildlife species.  



So the next time you’re planning to buy that gaudy snake print bag or are ready to flaunt your luxurious ivory jewelry, remember, YOU’VE JUST BOUGHT TROUBLE! After all, ignorance of the law is not an excuse! Are you a partner in wildlife crime?
