New Delhi: WWF-India family deeply regrets to inform about the untimely death of our dear colleague, Mr. Videh Upadhyay. Videh was fighting a tough battle since the last six weeks. He was diagnosed with pancreatitis and admitted at the Apollo Hospital, New Delhi. He showed immense courage with signs of recovery.  Unfortunately, as fate would have it, due to medical complications, Videh breathed his last today morning on October 27, in the hospital. He is survived by his wife and two young sons.   



Videh was associated with the Centre for Environmental Law at WWF-India for more than a year. WWF-India grieves the loss of a colleague who also became a dear friend in a short span of time. We pray for the departed soul and offer our sincere condolences to the family.



Videh’s contribution to WWF-India, by strengthening the Center for Environmental Law (CEL) team through issue-based environmental law research has been immense.  He was a lawyer and independent legal consultant for close to two decades based in New Delhi, with a practice focus on Water, Energy, Environment and Development laws, Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.



Videh’s demise is not only a loss to the organization but to the entire environmental fraternity. While his passion for environmental law was inspiring, his colleagues equally remember him as a wonderful human being. Videh was an ardent disciple of law and was always objective and non-partisan in his opinion. He was extremely fond of travelling, and in-spite of many professional commitments, he always ensured his kids never felt his absence.



Videh was not only an associate of the organization but an important member of the WWF-India family, and his untimely loss leaves a void in the organization.



We fondly remember his contribution to WWF-India.
