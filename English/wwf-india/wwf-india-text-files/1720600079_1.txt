Consultation Attempted to Seek Solutions regarding River Basin Management & Freshwater ConservationNew Delhi: With an aim to discuss approaches to address rivers’ restoration, a consortium of NGOs including WWF India, INTACH, SANDRP, Toxics Link and PEACE Institute Charitable Trust, organized the first ever India Rivers Week, 2014 as a national event in New Delhi from 24-27 of November 2014. The meeting brought together individuals, organisations and communities who have worked on river rejuvenation in different parts of the country.



Over 150 River experts, planners, researchers, artists, enthusiasts and activists from different parts of the country congregated in Delhi for 4 days to discuss, deliberate and exchange their experiences and ideas aimed at the rejuvenation of rivers in the country.



Former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh, giving the inaugural address at the first ever India Rivers Week emphasized, “Ours is a paradoxical society. While we show a lot of respect for rivers socially, we deal with rivers with utmost unconcern and disrespect.  India Rivers Week and India Rivers Forum is most welcome, will look forward to participate in it. If we want to save our rivers, the first step is to ensure that no untreated industrial effluent or sewage finds its way into our rivers.” Speaking on development objectives and the growing energy needs of India, he clarified, “Hydro projects may be a painful choice, but we cannot close our doors to it. What we can do is ensure stricter environmental regulations & their enforcement, a cumulative assessment at ‘basin’ and not ‘project’ level and the minimum environmental flow in the river itself.” He was critical of the current dispensation to dismantle all environmental regulations.



Ramaswamy R. Iyer, former Secretary to the Government of India stressed in his keynote added that rivers are, ‘more than just water, and an integral part of our social, historical and cultural fabric.’  He spoke on how we obstruct river flow, encroach flood plains, inflict pollution, and hold a economical, cavalier attitude towards it. In other words, “As an American engineer rightly said, we enjoy pushing rivers around,” he added.

The four day long consultation also showcased successful initiatives on river rejuvenation and rewarded Koel Karo, Latha Anantha and Akhil Gogoi for their remarkable track record of work on river conservation with the “Bhagirath Prayas Samman”.



The final day of India Rivers Week witnessed the presentation of ‘Delhi Declaration – let Our Rivers Live’, a Charter on  the proceedings of the four day Consultation and required steps for developing a consultative river basin management strategy, to the Union Minister for Water Resources, Shri. Uma Bharti. The Union Minister speaking in the valedictory function of the India Rivers Week hailed the first ever event on the vital issue. She emphasized “if we want to save our rivers, the first step is to ensure that no untreated effluent or sewage is mixed with treated water and finds its way into our rivers.” She assured that minimum environmental flows will be maintained in the river itself.
