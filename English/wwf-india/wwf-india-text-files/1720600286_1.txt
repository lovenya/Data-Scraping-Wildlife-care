“I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.

- Jorge Luis Borges



A book can unfold many wonders at a time. And an opportunity of a dialogue with its author reveals the seeds of thoughts out from which the book was borne.



Aspiring authors, budding nature enthusiasts and rising Earth warriors converged at WWF India's Auditorium on the bright and sunny morning of November 23rd, 2015.



Students from various schools in Delhi/NCR assembled for a tete-a-tete with the distinguished author Stephen Alter at the launch of his book 'The Secret Sanctuary' organized by Puffin India and WWF India. The session entailed a talk on 'Images of the Wildlife' followed by Stephen reading excerpts from his book. The house then opened for a question and answer session during which the students discovered an inquisitive child and a passionate naturalist in the author. The enthused students walked away with prizes they won during the pop up quiz and copies of the book 'The Secret Sanctuary' autographed by the author.
