Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) having an area of about 39 sq. km is located about 50 km east of Guwahati, Assam, India. The sanctuary is home to the densest population of Indian one horned rhinoceros. 



As part of the Indian Rhino Vision (IRV 2020), of which WWF-India is a part, 125 winter jackets were distributed to the frontline forest staff of the sanctuary. The jackets were handed over by Mr. Naren Chakraborty (retd. IFS and former PCCF, Assam) and presently the President, All India Service Pensioners Forum, Assam Branch in the presence of Mr. Salim Ahmed, Forest Range Office and Mr. Amit Sharma, Coordinator, Rhino Conservation, WWF-India. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Chakraborty said, “Very good work has been initiated under IRV2020 and I’m glad to see that the frontline soldiers are being cared for.” 



Mr. Raju Das, Forester, after receiving a jacket said, “Me and my colleagues are very happy as our request have been kept by WWF. The jackets are also very good and will provide a lot of relief to us in our duties during these cold nights.” 



WWF-India also supported the repair of the sanctuary’s patrolling vehicle and internal roads to help in patrolling activities. In addition, the fuel support and specific information being provided to the Assam Forest Department is helping the frontline forest staff in patrolling and thwarting a number of attempts made by poachers of late.
