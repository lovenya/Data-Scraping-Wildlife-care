A powerful earth quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the North Eastern region of India on September 18, 2011, with its epicentre 64 km west of Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, causing severe damage to roads, buildings and human lives. The most severely affected areas include the North District of Sikkim and the towns and villages located along the course of River Teesta of Rangpo, Dikchu, Singtam and Chungthang, which have witnessed landslides, and loss of power and water supply. The human casualties are up to 127 individuals and counting. Tremors were also felt in the nearby states of Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura, as well as far away states of Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Chandigarh and Delhi. 



While rescue teams have been working tirelessly to provide relief to the victims of this tragedy, nine villages located in Dzongu region of North Sikkim have been completely cut off due to massive landslides blocking all roads and unending rainfall cutting off all means of communication, leaving more than 1000 individuals stranded without any assistance. While none of the villages have been spared by this fury of nature, some of the most affected villages are Leek, Sakyong and Pentong. This region lies in the buffer of the Khangchendzonga National Park. 



WWF-India has been working in this area through its partners, the Ecotourism and Conservation Society of Sikkim (ECOSS); Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) and the Mutanchi Lom Aal Shezum (MLAS) to maintain the biodiversity values and cultural integrity of this landscape. After elaborate discussions with the Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department (FEWMD), the NGO partners, and compiling extensive feedback from the field, WWF-India teamed up with four other local NGOs to provide assistance to the affected villagers in this area through two relief camps in Manul and Lingzya.A team of 10 volunteers from WWF-India, ECOSS, KCC, ATREE and TMI and members of the SBFP project of FEWMD left from Gangtok to Dzongu on the morning of September 22, 2011 equipped with relief material like food rations, tarpaulin to build temporary shelters, torchlights, kerosene and provisions for drinking water. They reached Lingzya safely by the same evening and attended to the affected families’ needs. Three villages above Lingzya, i.e. Bay, Sakyong and Pentong are completely inaccessible right now, with Bay being the most affected. 



A team at the WWF-India Secretariat in New Delhi is coordinating with the team in Sikkim and have already sent 48 solar lanterns and 14 light weight tents. These are being distributed among the affected households in the areas where WWF-India has been working with the local communities for biodiversity conservation. 



Over the next few days, WWF-India’s team will be in constant touch with the District Administration to assess the damage and identify areas where further relief can be provided.
