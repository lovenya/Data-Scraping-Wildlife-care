New Delhi: WWF-India’s Khangchendzonga Landscape (KCL) Programme based in Gangtok, Sikkim has been awarded the prestigious ‘Ground Water Augmentation Award-2010’ today by the Government of India for its work on springshed development in Sikkim. The award is given every year for innovative practices of ground water augmentation. WWF-India was nominated for the award by the Rural Management and Development Department, Government of Sikkim for the support provided for the Dhara Vikash Programme of the department.



The award, consisting of a cash award of a Hundred thousand Rupees and a plaque with a citation, was presented by the Union Cabinet Minister for Water Resources and Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. Pawan Kumar Bansal and received by Ms. Priyadarshinee Shreshta, Landscape Coordinator of WWF-India’s Khangchendzonga Landscape Programme at the valedictory session of the ‘India Water Week and National Ground Water Congress’, being held from April 10th-14th 2012 in New Delhi, India.



Nearly 80% of the rural households of Sikkim depend on mountain springs as a source of drinking water, and these springs have been drying up over the years. While degradation in the catchment area from increased anthropogenic pressures was identified as the primary cause for drying up of springs in the past, an emerging new threat is climate variability. Understanding the need for working for revival of these springs, the Springshed Development or Dhara Vikas programme was conceptualised in 2008 by the Rural Management and Development Department (RMDD), Government of Sikkim in partnership with WWF-India and other NGOs to sustainably develop and rejuvenate the mountain springs in the state of Sikkim. 



The primary objective of the Dhara Vikas programme was to ensure that the surface runoff of rainwater in the springshed area is reduced and more water percolates down to recharge the underground aquifers, thus resulting in increased discharge of the springs. The programme was also conceived to work as a climate adaptation strategy for the villagers dependent on these springs. 



The actual implementation in the field was undertaken through the flagship programme of the Government of India, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or rural employment guarantee scheme. Eight drought prone areas in the South and West districts of Sikkim were initially selected for implementing the programme on a pilot scale. Field facilitators of RMDD were the main driving force at the ground level to ensure success of this project. 



With technical support from the People’s Science Institute, Dehradun, WWF-India facilitated the training of master trainers consisting mainly of field facilitators, who would undertake the Dhara Vikash or springshed development programme in their own areas. These ‘grassroots water engineers’ received training that taught them the use of GPS, identification of the catchment areas and measuring and monitoring the spring discharge, among other things. Exposure trips to the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, where similar ground water recharge initiatives had been undertaken were also organised. 



The success of this programme could be demonstrated by the discharge data of the springs that were gathered before and after the intervention. The result compared over a year after one season, clearly demonstrated that the spring discharge had increased at all the project sites even during the lean season. 



Based on the success of the pilots the Dhara Vikas programme is now being scaled up by the state government to include larger catchment areas that would benefit multiple downstream springs and streams simultaneously. WWF-India continues to support the State Government of Sikkim in independently monitoring the discharge data at the different spring sites. 



WWF also recognises the wonderful partnership between RMDD and SIRD, ACWADAM, PSI, and above all the local communities which made the Dhara Vikas Program such a great success.
