A world-renowned expert on Asian elephants and fondly known as Elephant Man, Mr. Ajay Desai spent decades studying the behaviour of Asian elephants.

 

He was associated with WWF-India as a consultant for over 15 years. With a great understanding of elephant behaviour and ecology, several studies on human-elephant interactions and elephant movements were conducted under his guidance.  With his vast scientific knowledge and a completely new perspective, he provided practical and effective conservation solutions.

 

He will be remembered as an eminent conservationist but more than that, as a great human being.

 

His passing is a great loss to the cause of wildlife conservation. Remembering Mr. Ajay Desai
