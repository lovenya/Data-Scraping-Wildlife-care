Another wave of floods has hit Upper Assam affecting people and wildlife
Introduction

After the devastating floods of June, Upper Assam is beset by floods again. The water levels of river Brahmaputra and its tributaries have risen steadily over the past few days. The Brahmaputra has crossed the Danger Level in most of the water level recording stations. The weather forecast for the next few days predicts more rain for the region. 



Latest Flood Situation (as of September 24th)

Floodwater has entered the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) and necessitated personnel in interior camps along the river to be moved out. The DFO, KNP had sent out a telephonic warning on the morning of 21st September and requested WWF-India to be on standby in case there was need for support in rescue of wildlife affected by floods. The floodwater presently (as of 3pm on 23rd Sept) is about 20-22 inches below the highest level it reached during June. However, it has risen rapidly by about 18-20 inches since last evening (5 pm of 22nd Sept). 







Given yesterday’s level at Dibrugarh and Nematighat (Jorhat) it is expected that the water level in KNP will rise over the next 24-48 hours. The river has reached the level of its banks in Tezpur, headquarter of Sonitpur district and entered low lying parts of the town.



WWF-India supported speedboats are already with the KNP authorities and will be useful during emergencies. 



The staff of WWF-India is constantly in touch with the Park authorities and monitoring the situation on the ground closely.
