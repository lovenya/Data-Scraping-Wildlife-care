The Secretary-General of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) attended a conference hosted by HRH The Prince of Wales and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson MP. The event called for action at the highest levels to stop the illegal trade in wildlife – an activity that jeopardizes not only the world’s conservation efforts but also poses a serious threat to national and regional security and the economy. Speaking on the occasion, HRH The Prince of Wales said : “The animals being slaughtered to fuel this entirely unnecessary trade provide many benefits to humans, as well as tothose other species that share their habitat. It is surely unthinkable that these creatures, which have roamed the planet for thousands, if not millions, of years, could disappear completely within a decade, or even less. As a father and a soon-to-be grandfather, I find it inconceivablethat our children and grandchildren could live in a world bereft of these animals. Humanity is less than humanity without the rest of creation. Their destruction will diminish us all. Perhaps those of us in this room will know how difficult it can be to convince others of the importance of preserving and protecting wildlife and its habitat as part of our heritage and “natural capital”. How, then, can we encourage more people to share our concern and turn that concern into action?”
