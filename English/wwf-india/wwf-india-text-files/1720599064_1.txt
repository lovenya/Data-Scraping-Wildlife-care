New Delhi: WWF- India and HarperCollins Publishers India released a book- “Billy Arjan Singh- Tiger of Dudhwa” by Shaminder Boparai today. Dr Karan Singh released the book.



‘One man in a billion - there is no other example of a person on this planet who served, lived and fought for the tiger for more than sixty years. Billy Arjan Singh dreamt of tigers succeeding in India- it is this dream we all try to fulfill.’- VALMIK THAPAR, Tiger conservationist. 



Billy Arjan Singh is the only person in the world known to have hand-reared a tiger cub and returned it to the wild. This pictorial biography is a tribute to this enigmatic character who was one of the first people t o put the spotlight on tiger conservation in India. It chronicles his controversial life and times, and tells the story of his pioneering experiments in bringing up leopard and tiger cubs, along with his pet dog, in harmony. The book is a timely publication following a year after Billy’s demise on 1 January 2010. In a world dominated by lab-coat conservationists, his voice remains a disturbing reminder of the heartfelt and uncompromising conservation values, unblemished by real politik, that are forgotten today.



Shaminder Boparai is a dedicated wildlife enthusiast, avid birdwatcher and freelance photographer. He lives in Chandigarh, but is mostly found wandering in a national park or a forest. He was closely associated with Billy Arjan Singh during the last few years of the conservationist’s life, documenting his work and achievements. 



On this occasion, Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India said “Billy Arjan Singh is a role model for all those who are working to protect the tiger. Shaminder’s book is a comprehensive record of Billy’s dedication and contribution towards tiger conservation. I hope this book encourages many to join the cause."
