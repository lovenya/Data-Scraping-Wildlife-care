Lucknow: WWF-India and Uttar Pradesh Forest Department with the support of National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) are all set to conduct the Dolphin census this year along with the ‘My Ganga, My Dolphin’ campaign 2015. The census was officially announced in a press conference in Lucknow by a panel comprising Shri. Sanjeev Sharan, Principal Secretary, Forests, Dr. Prashant Verma, Chief Conservator of Forests, Eco-Development, Uttar Pradesh Forest Department, Shri. Iqbal Singh, Managing Director, UP Forest Corporation, Shri. Anupam Gupta, Director Lucknow Zoological Garden and Mr. Suresh Babu, Director-Rivers, Wetlands and Water Policy, WWF-India. The census is scheduled to be conducted from October 5-8, 2015 in selected stretches of the Ganga, Yamuna, Chambal, Ken, Betwa, Son, Sharda, Geruwa, Ghaghara, Gandak and Rapti. Speaking at the event, Dr. Prashant Verma said, “This time, the survey will cover 3,350 KM stretch of the rivers. 21 teams have been formed comprising Divisional Forest Officials leading the teams with representation from 23 NGOs. A central team coordinated by CCF Eco-Development will oversee the campaign”. Conducted on a much larger scale this year, the census will be carried out in a decentralized manner with over 200 people involved in teams simultaneously covering 50-60 km in two shifts in a day.

 

Shri Sanjeev Sharan said “Uttar Pradesh is set to become the first state in the country to have conducted a Dolphin Census using a uniform methodology involving various stakeholders. We are launching this campaign not only to count the number of Dolphins but also to assess the ecosystem health of the Ganga and design a comprehensive strategy to ensure its conservation.” The exercise will also thereby help build the capacity of participating teams with regard to effective monitoring and data collection skills. Speaking about the ‘My Ganga, My Dolphin’ campaign, Mr. Suresh Babu said, “This campaign aims at raising awareness on the conservation of the Ganga River Dolphin, the National Aquatic Animal of India, and a unique charismatic mega- fauna, which needs attention. We also hope to build capacity of forest officials, local NGOs and communities on Dolphin identification, the assessment of threats to the species, their habitats and their conservation by helping them become Dolphin mitras (friends of the Dolphins)”



Shri. Sanjeev Sharan, Principal Secretary, Forests, will flag off the campaign from Kanpur on October 5, also observed as the National Dolphin Day. Flag offs will be simultaneously organized at Bijnore, Narora, Farrukhabad, Allahabad, Dabri, Hamirpur, Tasod, Bareh, Nepal Border, Kartniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Jalimnagar bridge, Sitapur, Barabanki, Faizabad, Doharighat, Sharavasti, Orchha, Jigani, Bilharka, and Obra. The official numbers will be announced in a closing ceremony scheduled for the 9th of October.

 

The Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) locally known as  "Susu" or “Soons” is known as the ‘Tiger of the Ganges’ since it has the same position in a river ecosystem as a tiger in a forest, its presence indicating a sign of a healthy river ecosystem.  An endemic fauna of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna river systems, the mammal prefers to stay in deep waters in and around the confluence of two or more rivers, sharing its habitat with crocodiles, freshwater turtles and wetland birds many of which are fish eaters and are potential competitors for their prey base. The species is listed endangered by the IUCN and is placed in Schedule I in the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

 

Once abundant, the species populations are reported to have declined drastically in much of its distribution range. The habitat altered remains fragmented and increasing pollution in freshwater ecosystems adversely affect animal health, and bioaccumulation may lead to serious consequences. The population of dolphin in 1982 was estimated to be between 4000-5000 in India, now it is less than 2000 with an annual mortality estimated to be at 130-160 animals. Habitat destruction and lacking of a meaningful estimate of range-wise abundance has often caused a major hindrance in developing conservation management plan. WWF-India’s ‘Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers’ programme looks at the  conservation of 7 indicator species including the Ganga River Dolphin, three species of Turtle, Gharial, Otter and Mahaseer. The Ganga River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) was adopted as one of WWF-India’s priority species in 1997. ‘My Ganga, My Dolphin’ campaign 2015 to roll out for the second time in Uttar Pradesh
