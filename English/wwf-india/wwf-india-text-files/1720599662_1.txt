WWF-India Secretariat, New Delhi – On the occasion of World Wetlands Day (WWD), wetlands across WWF’s key natural landscapes were celebrated for their unmatched ecological and cultural values on Saturday, February 2, 2013, keeping in mind this year’s theme of ‘Wetlands take care of water’. This theme set by the Ramsar Convention and UNESCO’s International Hydrological Programme, reflects the interdependence between water and wetlands and the key role that wetlands play. Making the link between wetlands and water is critical: without water there will be no wetlands – and without wetlands there will be no water!



Every year, World Wetlands Day is celebrated the world over to mark the signing of the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, called Ramsar Convention, on February 2, 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar. It is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. Actions aimed at raising public awareness of wetland values and benefits and the convention have been taken since 1997 by government agencies, NGOs, and groups of citizens at all levels of the community.



This year, highlighting the theme of ‘Wetlands take care of water’, a number of events and activities were organised.

Jammu
In collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Protection and Department of Environment and Remote Sensing, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), WWF-India celebrated World Wetlands Day at Mansar Wetland, a Ramsar site, in Jammu. The Hon’ble Minister of State for Forests, Environment and Ecology was the Chief Guest at the event. 



On this occasion, a symposium on the theme of the importance of wetlands was organised, which was attended by school students, members of panchayat, scientists, academicians, conservationists, officials from different government departments and common masses. There was also a painting competition, a photography exhibition and a film screening at the wetland. In addition, the children were taken for a nature trail to help them get interested in the outdoors. There was also a stall where the WWF team demonstrated their technical equipment for water testing. The event was attended by faculty members of Jammu University, officials from the Department of Wildlife Protection and Department of Remote Sensing. A group of students from Higher Secondary School, Mansar also present a skit before the audience pertaining to the issues the Mansar Wetland is facing and the role of local masses in its conservation. WWF-India also displayed the resource material developed by the organization for the education institutions and the equipment meant for the monitoring of wetland ecosystems.
