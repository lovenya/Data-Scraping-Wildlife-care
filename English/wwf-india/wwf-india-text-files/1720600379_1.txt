New Delhi, June: Individuals from all walks of life came together to pledge their support for fighting wildlife crime to mark the World Environment Day 2016 . The event was organised at Raahgiri, Connaught Place, New Delhi, during the early hours on Sunday by the  Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), TRAFFIC, WWF-India, United Nations Development Programme, ENVIS Centers, PETA and Maashakti.



Celebrated globally on 5 June every year, the World Environment day highlights various conservation and environmental issues, with the theme changing every year. This year, the theme -  Go Wild for Life- Zero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade’ focused on the need to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade to ensure survival of our species in the wild. Therefore the event at Raahgiri focused largely on this very important and perturbing issue.



TRAFFIC and WWF-India along with other partner organizations engaged the participants through wildlife films, wildlife quizzes, skits performed by students of law, painting competitions, slogan writing competitions, cultural programme and much more at Raahgiri. The highlight of the event was the march past of individuals around the inner circle of the Connaught Place with volunteers and supporters holding placards of various messages related to wildlife conservation and environmental protection. Another popular activity at the event was the selfie corner where cut outs of various protected species and related themes were put on display for participants to take selfies with- driving home the message that wildlife is ours to protect and not ours to consume.



There was  also a Wildlife Pledge taken by participants at the event, led by Mr. A.N. Jha, Secretary Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India to combat wildlife crime. The Pledge Wall , where more than 700 individuals pledged to say NO to buying illegal wildlife products in order to support efforts to curb poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Visitors also participated in various painting competitions quizzes and slogan writing competitions. The winners from various competitions were given attractive prices. Also placed at the event was a painting wall for individuals to paint their thoughts and ideas about wildlife conservation and protection.



Ms Tilotama Varma, Addl. Director- WCCB said, “World Environment Day has given us an opportunity to highlight the on going wildlife crime that has endangered the future of many wildlife species in India. While enforcement agencies like ours are continuously strengthening and evolving ourselves to control this growing menace it is important that we have support of the end consumers of these wildlife products. Through the event at Raahgiri on this World Environment Day we hope that we were able to send a strong and impactful message about joining hands to fight wildlife crime”.



Dr Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC India further commented, “Today, poaching is driven by consumer demand and if the consumer demand is curbed the poaching will stop subsequently. Tiger, leopard, pangolin, monitor lizard, black spotted turtles, star tortoises, parakeets and many more species are being devoured by the illegal wildlife trade markets to the extent that the future of the species appears bleak in the wild. Illegal wildlife trade has emerged as one of the most significant threats to the wildlife and engaging public support is crucial to the success of eradicating this epidemic. TRAFFIC acknowledges its partnership with the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, WCCB, TRAFFIC, WWF, United Nations Development Programme, ENVIS Centers, PETA and Maashakti and appreciates the support extended by all in organizing this event”.
