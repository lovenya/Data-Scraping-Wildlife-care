New Delhi, India: An international partnership between WWF and the forest products industry - the Global Forest & Trade Network (GFTN) - has today launched a new national arm, the Global Forest & Trade Network-India (GFTN-India).



Amongst the Indian companies that have registered , some are - Asha Handicrafts Association (Mumbai), Manglam Arts (Jaipur), TEDDY Exports (Madurai) and ITC Ltd (Andhra Pradesh) - who supply timber, wood products, and paper to Europe and the US, have applied to become the first Indian participants in this internationally renowned trade network. GFTN-India will encourage trade links between companies which are committed to achieving responsible forestry, and will aim to create market conditions that support forest conservation whilst providing economic and social benefits for the businesses and people that depend upon them.WWF-India will work closely with Government of India to promote sustainable management of forests in line with GFTN goals and aims to promote the practices to achieve this goal.



In a written statement received from the office of Mr. S. Regupathy, Hon’ble Minister of State for Environment and Forests, Government of India, the Minister welcomed the initiative and hoped that it would facilitate trade links between companies committed to achieving and supporting responsible forestry and promotion of credible forest certification in India. 



Speaking at the launch, Mr Richard McLellan, Head of GFTN, WWF International, said: “The new GFTN-India is an opportunity to protect India’s economy and its forests. We welcome the chance to encourage forest certification and responsible forestry, and we are looking forward to working with the Indian government and with industry to develop credible certification for India’s forests.”



Forests cover roughly 20% of India’s total geographical area and forestry is the second biggest land-use in India after agriculture Estimates suggest that the demand for timber in India is likely to almost triple from 58 million cubic meters in 2005 to 153 million cubic meters in 2020, and that the supply of wood will more than double from 29 million cubic meters in 2000 to 60 million cubic meters in 2020. Most of the timber currently used in India comes from plantations but, as demand outstrips supply, India’s natural forests will come under threat. 



Dr. Kirit S Parikh, Member of the Planning Commission in his key note address said, “GFTN is important in the context of Indian Forestry. GFTN can serve as a programme in which we can do forestry in a commercial and sustainable way. 



Robert Donkers, Environment Counseller, Delegation of the European Commission to India, Bhutan and Nepal noted, “New proposals with the European Parliament are under considerations to minimize the risk of illegally harvested timber and timber products entering the EU market.” He added, “It’s great that the GFTN is being launched in India before this important legislation restricts trade. Also, it is heartening to note that this initiative is more than supply- side oriented.”



“It is vital that India takes the lead in setting a course of development. The launch of GFTN-India represents a clear move in this direction and, with the support of industry both nationally and across the globe, we can make a real difference in protecting the world’s forests and the people and species that depend upon them.” Mr Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India.



India is exposed to timber imports which may have come from unsustainably managed forests or which have been illegally harvested and this, in turn, will affect India’s ability to export its manufactured wood products to Europe and the US .Recently improved legislation such as the amended Lacey Act in the US (June 2008) and the FLEGT process in Europe aim to stop trade in illegal wood and wood products from entering key markets.



WWF’s Global Forest & Trade Network and the new GFTN-India can help to address these issues without sacrificing economic growth in India. By setting up business sectors and establishing links between buyers and suppliers, the GFTN is able to drive the market for certified wood which helps to protect forests and those who rely on them for food and income. GFTN-India can help forest owners - including the Indian government who own 90% of India’s forests - to move towards forest certification, to match buyers to suppliers nationally and globally,



“Supporting India’s emerging economy is as important as protecting its forests and, in this instance; they are one and the same. The GFTN-India is an opportunity for industry and conservationists to work together to establish business networks based on certified forests and products, and create wider markets based on sustainability.” George White, Responsible Purchasing Coordinator, GFTN, WWF International.



Through the GFTN, WWF is working with industry to encourage a change in purchasing behavior and hopes to encourage a switch to the production and consumption of wood and wood products from credibly certified sustainable forests. By offering certification and its associated market advantages to the forest industry, WWF is working towards a creating a better future for the world’s forests.
