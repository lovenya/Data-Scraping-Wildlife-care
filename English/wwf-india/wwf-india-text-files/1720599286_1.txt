The entire quiz was divided into 6 interesting rounds testing the children on their familiarity with different aspects of wildlife ranging from identification of bird calls, to identification some species with the help of visual cues, their knowledge about different kinds of fish, insects, trees and much more! Mallika Sarabhai, a noted Kuchipudi dancer, film-maker, writer, a well- known social activist and a Padma Bhushan awardee was the Chief Guest and the Quiz Hostess.

Speaking on the success of the quiz, Mita Goswami, Director, Environment Education, WWF- India said, “Wild Wisdom goes beyond memorizing facts and figures about Nature, it is about celebrating the beauty and amazing diversity of our precious planet. We look forward to many more editions of Wild Wisdom and increased participation every year!”



Three teams made it through to win the final prize – a two-day trip to Jim Corbett National Park.
