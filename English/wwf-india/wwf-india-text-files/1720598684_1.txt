On November 11, an event was organized at St. Joseph High School, Kanpur, where over 500 secondary student groups attended screening of the award-winning documentary - “Agony of the Ganges”. The documentary - supported by Living Ganga Programme - highlights concerns related to present conditions and the role individuals can play to infuse life in the Ganga. Shri.

The second activity was a programme presentation followed by a Ghat cleanup drive by young cadets of 17 Girls Battalion of National Cadets Corp on November 14, 2009. Dr. Suresh K Rohilla and Shri Rakesh Jaiswal gave a programme presentation and emphasized the role of NCC cadets can play in river restoration. Col. Bireshwar Kumar, Commanding officer of the cadets, announced support to the programme and also his decision to adopt the Ghat for regular cleanup and maintenance.
