Vladivostok: WWF-Russia, Governor of Primorsky region in the Russian Far East, and the Consul Generals of India and Vietnam in Vladivostok inaugurated the International Tiger Youth Forum here on 19 November.



The 30 young Tiger Ambassadors from all Tiger Range Countries were met by students and young environmentalists from Vladivostok and nearby towns. The Forum has been popular with the local as well as national news channels covering it. Some of these have been following the delegates right from their arrival at the airport, extending the coverage to the opening ceremony as well as the field visit.



The forum providing a wonderful opportunity for Anusha Shankar and Devanshu Sood, the WWF-India’s tiger ambassadors. They met the rangers and forest officers who have managed to restore the population of Amur tiger, a subspecies of Panthera tigris. Spending five days with their counterparts from other countries is helping them to get a first hand account of plight of these big cats in all the other tiger range countries.



On the first day, participants of the forum opened the Tiger Trail on Sportivnaya queue in Vladivostok. The trail, consists of 13 black and rose granite stones, put in chess order, each with a tiger track and name of one of the countries, still inhabited by tigers – India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, China, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Russia. 



Now, each tiger range country has its own tiger track in Vladivostok, on stones laid by its young Tiger Ambassadors.
