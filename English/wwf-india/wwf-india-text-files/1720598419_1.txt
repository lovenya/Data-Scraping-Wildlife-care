Carbon Disclosure Project, the World’s Largest Investor Coalition, Seeks Further Disclosure on Climate Change and Shareholder Value

Posted on 06 February 2008

Carbon Disclosure Project requests information from 3,000 global companies on behalf of investors with assets of over $57 trillion. 



London/New Delhi: The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) a collaboration of 385 institutional investors, with assets under management of $57 trillion, has issued its 2008 information request to the world’s largest corporations. This asks companies to measure and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and report on their strategy for dealing with risks and opportunities associated with climate change. 



The resulting information will be held on the CDP website, the largest database in the world on corporate climate change information. 



Investors that have signed up to CDP include Merrill Lynch, AXA, ANZ, Banco do Brazil, Mitsubishi UFJ, AIG Investments, Barclays, RBS Group and HSBC. Legg Mason, Insurance Australia Group and the Florida State Board of Administration are among over 70 new investors to join this year. 



The collective assets under management held by CDP signatories have increased by more than 30% from $41 trillion to $57 trillion, showing that an increasing number of investors are considering climate change in their investment decisions. 



CDP in India 

Last year’s CDP 5 was the first-ever voluntary disclosure of carbon footprint by 110 large Indian corporates by market capitalisation. The CDP process was well received by the Business & Industry with many corporates voluntarily disclosing their carbon footprint. This year’s edition - CDP 6 - aims to enhance its reach and will cover top 200 companies. 



Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, speaking about WWF-India’s role noted “This is a contribution of a conservation organisation to bring to fore accounting of Green House Gas emission and voluntary disclosure thereof by the Business and Industry”. 



CDP in India is led and funded by WWF-India. 



Mr. Shirish Sinha, Head, Climate Change and Energy Programme, WWF-India said, “Working with the corporate sector to assess their carbon footprint is an integral component of our climate programme. Within the CDP framework, we envision to work with Indian financial sector to increase their level of awareness and urge them to integrate risk and mitigating measures in their business plans and investment decision of corporates.” 



YES Bank, a private sector Indian Bank, is the only signatory of CDP from India and endeavours to mainstream sustainability within the Indian context. Speaking about YES BANK’s participation, Mr. Rana Kapoor, Founder/Managing Director & CEO, YES BANK said, “I truly believe that the CDP provides institutional investors with a relevant platform to leverage their position of influencing investment and management decisions of the business community to align itself with broader sustainability goals. We at YES BANK are cognizant of our responsibility in augmenting the sustainable development of India and are committed to creating a commercially viable financial institution that incorporates sustainability within its core business focus.” 



Paul Dickinson, Chief Executive Officer of the Carbon Disclosure Project, said: “The momentum behind CDP represents the start of a unified global business response to climate change. The continued growth in investors supporting CDP and requesting the companies they invest in to respond through the CDP system demonstrates that we have entered an era when climate change has become a mainstream issue for both investors and corporations. Investors recognise that corporate engagement with climate change issues is an important indicator of good quality corporate management.” 



Recent CDP research with US signatory investors discovered that CDP information is very important to investors’ decision making. It found that: 



• 60% of investors identified which companies in their portfolio were either not responding to CDP, or were providing poor or trivial answers. The investors then used this information to further engage with these companies on the issue of climate change. 

• 26% of investors supported shareholder resolutions for better disclosure on climate change from some companies not complying with CDP disclosure. 

• All the investors interviewed agreed that the CDP data is a valuable resource and incorporated it into their decision making process at some level. 



CDP has this year requested information from over 3,000 companies, up from 2,400 in 2007. It has launched operations in five new geographies and widened its scope in many existing regions. 



Global Reach 

For the first time ever CDP will write to China’s 100 largest companies, by market capitalisation. This is a key step in leveraging investor influence to support Chinese companies in measuring and disclosing their carbon emissions and climate related strategy. CDP is working with local agent SynTao to encourage Chinese enterprises to engage with these issues. 



CDP will also launch new operations in Korea, Latin America, Spain and the Netherlands, where CDP operations are supported by the Dutch Environment Agency, VROM and ABP. 



The Information Request 

The CDP information request focuses on the following factors that may affect the value of a company: 

- Total greenhouse gas emissions 

- Regulatory risk/opportunity (e.g. limits on emissions) 

- Physical risk/opportunity (e.g. changes in weather patterns impacting operations) 

- Consumer sentiment risk/opportunity (e.g. reputation) 

- Steps taken to manage and reduce emissions 



Corporations have been asked to respond to the CDP information request within four months. The individual company responses, plus analysis of the responses, will be launched in September 2008 and made available free of charge on the CDP website at www.cdproject.net.
 All companies are encouraged to answer the information request in full. However, in order to provide maximum flexibility, the 2008 CDP information request comprises two types of questions - ‘minimum standards’ which all companies should complete; and ‘comprehensive answer’ questions which leading companies in high impact sectors will be expected to complete. 



The information request also includes new questions on how companies communicate their engagement with policy-makers on climate change issues and more detailed requests for data from those involved in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 

Investors using CDP data: 



“Sustainability issues have increased in importance with investors. The CDP supports AIG Investments’ efforts to assess and analyse trends in risks and opportunities associated with climate change and its mitigation. Climate change continues to be a major financial and investment concern for us and our clients.” Win Neuger, CEO, AIG Investments 



“The concept of low carbon footprint companies is a win-win idea. Those companies will likely have a higher quality of business management and will limit impact on earnings. Investors also have the opportunity to lower their own carbon footprint by investing in those companies.” 

Abyd Karmali, Managing Director and Global Head of Carbon Emissions, Merrill Lynch 



"As an investor, we are concerned to know whether the companies we are investing in are adequately taking account of climate-related risks. However, the data is often not available, sometimes not comparable or of poor quality. As a part of the Carbon Disclosure Project, we hope to collect more reliable data, so eventually, a common emissions measurement methodology can be developed." 

Joachim Faber, Allianz Board Member responsible for asset management 



"The specialist focus of the Carbon Disclosure Project provides a suitably rigorous structure for an overview of a company’s response to climate change, and the survey template is a very helpful management tool for us to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in our own business.” 

Sir Tom McKillop, Chairman, Royal Bank of Scotland Group

• 500 of the largest companies globally (Global 500) 

• 500 of the largest companies in the USA (S&P 500)
