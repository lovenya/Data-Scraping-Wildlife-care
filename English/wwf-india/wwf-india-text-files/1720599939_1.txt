WWF-India, Moradabad civic bodies to engage local citizens for river conservation
Moradabad: The District Administration and Nagar Nigam Moradabad along with WWF-India initiated the Hifazat Ramganga Ki, Zimmedari Hum Sabki! campaign on World Environment Day along the banks of the Ramganga, at the Kali Devi Ka Mandir in the city. This is a new phase of the Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga campaign where WWF-India along with the civic bodies will focus on action on ground—saving water, conserving water bodies and keeping the river banks clean so that the ecological impacts on the river is minimized. This year-round campaign will be divided into four phases.



The city’s mayor, Mrs Veena Agarwal including other city and senior government officials were present for the occasion. More than 300 students from 20 public and private schools participated in the event. The spirited young adults, the dignitaries, accompanied by Ramganga Mitras, NSS volunteers, school teachers and the community members enjoyed a fervent street play, enlightening them about the threats faced by the Ramganga and explaining that how little efforts like plantation on the river bank can help revive the river. 



Ms Veena Aggarwal, Mayor added, “Nagar Nigam is concerned with the state of the river and all possible steps will be taken to address this. This event is a great opportunity to recommit ourselves to the cause of the river”. Mr Vinod Aggarwal,  stated: “All of us need to work together if we want to conserve our Ramganga and our environment. Water is life. No living form can survive without water, and we need to preserve the river for survival. We are all responsible for the river’s health. But it is saddening that none of us have taken responsibility. Let us all pledge to take responsibility of the river and plant trees”.



"Over the next one year we hope that this will emerge as a model of Government-Civil Society-Community collaboration on river conservation, We are enthused by the support from the District Administration, Nagar Nigam and the local citizens of Moradabad in Ramganga conservation issue to the centre of debate,” said Mr Suresh Babu, Director, River Basins & Water Policy, WWF-India.
