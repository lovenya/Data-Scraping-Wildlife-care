WWF-India joins the entire wildlife community in mourning the demise of Dr. AJT Johnsingh. We are united in celebrating his contributions to the fields of ecology and conservation. Dr. Johnsinghâ€™s work is unparalleled, and his influence as a naturalist and mentor will continue to inspire future generations.



Dr. Johnsingh was dedicated to training several cadres of wildlife managers and researchers. He retired as Dean of the Faculty of Wildlife Sciences at the Wildlife Institute of India in 2005 and had been a Senior Scientific Advisor with WWF-India ever since.



He will be remembered as an exemplary and empathetic colleague, a beacon of the wildlife community, and a wonderful human being. His perseverance, presence, and optimism will be missed.
