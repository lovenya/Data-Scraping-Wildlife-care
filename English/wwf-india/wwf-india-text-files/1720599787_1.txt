 “The perfection & absolute beauty of nature in numerous species made me passionate about Nature. 



WWF is an organization with clear objectives and a dedicated team of professionals working towards saving our planet. The best way is to support the experts because they can utilize resources for conservation in the most effective way. For example, most Indians may not be aware of the Ganges river dolphin and how important it is for the eco-system. WWF-India is working on the conservation of this threatened species. With efforts from organisations like WWF-India, I am confident that future generations would also be able to enjoy our beautiful planet in the same way as I could.”
