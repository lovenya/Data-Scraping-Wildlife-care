Madhya Pradesh:  With an aim to provide clean energy access, WWF-India has installed a 10 kWp micro solar PV power station in the Bajgundi Forest Village, Aamgahan Panchayat, Balaghat District of Madhya Pradesh The plant, inaugurated on July 17, 2014 has been set up by WWF-India through Energy Green, the implementing agency responsible for setting up the solar PV plant in the village. 



According to Census 2011, Balaghat district has over 1.14 lakh households that are dependent on kerosene for their main source of lighting. The installed solar plant will provide an alternate to this and help provide clean energy access to 62 households, one school, one anganwadi and one community hall in the village. In addition, stand-alone solar home lighting systems are also provided for two remote households. Each household is connected with a solar off-grid distribution line, two CFL points and a mobile charging port. In addition to this, 27 LED street lights have been set up through the length and breadth of the village, which is approximately 80 km from Mandla and 40 km from the Mukki gate of the Kanha National Park. 



Working alongside local communities for the maintenance and upkeep of this project, the local youth has been trained in handling minor repairs and day-to-day maintenance of the plant. In addition, awareness and capacity building exercises have also been carried out for the villagers. 



One of the most unique features about this installation is that the plant is operated and maintained by the Eco Development Committee of the village, the members of which are selected from among the village itself. Energy usage charges are decided by the community so as to take care of the operational costs of the plant. Load limiters have also been installed in each household of the village which ensures availability of the specified quota of electricity round the clock, and no overdrawal of power by any individual household. 



Mr. Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF-India, on the occasion said, "The micro solar power plant in Bajgundi empowers the lives of the village community by providing them basic access to electricity in a clean and sustainable manner. This in turn helps in mainstreaming the community by enhancing educational opportunities and telecommunication accessibility. The model demonstrated here has significant potential for replication and there are opportunities for further collaboration amongst the various stakeholders.”
