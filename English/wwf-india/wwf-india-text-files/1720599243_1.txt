Background

Straddling the foothills of the mighty Himalayas with the pristine River Ganges adjoining it towards the east, the Rajaji National Park is distinct for its scenic beauty and rich bio-diversity. Located between the towns of Haridwar and Dehradun the park is a paradise for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts and has carnivores like tigers and leopards as well as ungulates like the spotted deer and goral. This area is also the north-western limit of Asian elephants. The park came into existence in 1983 when the three sanctuaries in Uttaranchal’s Shivalik Range, representing the Shivalik Ecosystem - Rajaji, Motichur and Chila, were amalgamated into a large protected area and named after the famous freedom fighter Late Sri C. Rajgopalachari; popularly known as "Rajaji". Spread over an area of 820.42sq. km, Rajaji is the beginning of the vast Indo–Gangetic plains, representing vegetation of several distinct zones and forest types like sal forests, riverine forests, board–leaved mixed forests, scrubland and grassy. It is also home to over 300 bird species. The park is a part of the Terai Arc Landscape (see map), where WWF-India has its activities focused through many field offices. 



WWF-India’s support

Keeping in mind the park’s strategic location in the landscape, the importance of its tiger population and the pressures it faces, WWF-India provided a 4-wheel drive pick-up vehicle (M&M Bolero Camper) to the Rajaji National Park authorities for effective mobility of the park’s patrolling staff. This will strengthen the tiger conservation in the park. The keys of the vehicle were handed over on 16 September 2011 at the office of the PCCF (Wildlife) - Uttrakhand by Dr. Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF-India to Mr. S. S. Raseilly IFS, Director, Rajaji National Park in the presence of Mr. Shravan Kumar, Deputy Director, Rajaji National Park, Dr. Harish Guleria, Head, WWF-India’s Terai Arc Landscape, Park Officials and WWF representatives. 



On the occasion, Dr. Worah informed that WWF-India will work with the Uttarakhand state Forest Department to maintain the connectivity through different wildlife corridors and strengthen the protection regime in the Park by providing support for anti-poaching and habitat restoration as well as help with tiger and prey monitoring. She told that WWF-India will provide field equipment for frontline staff to effectively patrol as well as help with capacity building of the field staff for effective protection and better law enforcement. Mr. Raseilly thanked WWF for this support and said that this will help in better mobility of the park’s field staff.



WWF-India also provided the youth of the local communities with 10 binoculars, who are working as eco-tourism guides in the park. Strengthening Tiger Conservation in Rajaji National Park
