October 24 is globally celebrated as the World Dolphin Day with an aim to raise the profile of this highly endangered mammal whose population has been continually declining due to habitat loss and poaching. WWF- India joined the celebrations by organizing a series of programmes on the occasion to create awareness about the species and its status in the River Ganges.



India is home to Ganges River Dolphins which are threatened by reduced water flows, pollution and entanglement in fisheries nets. Alterations to the river due to barrages are also separating populations. A recent survey conducted by WWF-India and its partners identified fewer than 2,000 individuals in the entire distribution range in Ganga and Brahamaputra river systems (in a stretch of 6,000 kms of river approximately). 



WWF-India has been working for the conservation of the Ganges River dolphin since 1997 with an objective to ensure that habitat degradation and fisheries bycatch do not threaten the species.



To mitigate the identified threats, WWF has been working to encourage the local communities along a 164 km stretch that serves as an important dolphin habitat in the upper Ganga region, to use natural fertilizers; not to dispose domestic sewerage in the river; to improve sewerage management; to reforest the river bank; and to develop policies to stop commercial fishing and sand-mining activities. WWF also monitors dolphin populations and threats in other important dolphin habitats in the country.



It is in this context that WWF-India organized activities involving general public, students, locals and forest officials in this area. Over 3000 students from several primary and secondary schools of the Upper Ganga region (Anupshaher, Narora and Debai) participated in events like poster and rangoli-making, boat safari in the Ganges to visit the dolphin’s site, street plays, a rally that involved several community members along with students from various schools and much more. The students hoped that these activities will help their voice reach the policy makers and common people alike and bring about positive change towards dolphin conservation.
