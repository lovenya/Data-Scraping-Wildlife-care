Moradabad: District Administration of Moradabad along with World Wide Fund for Nature-India’s (WWF-India) Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers Programme, organized a momentous Ramganga walk to raise awareness about the degrading state of the river and to understand the challenges faced by it. The purpose of the walk was also to actively engage the citizen’s of Moradabad in the planned upcoming Ramganga conservation activities in the city. Rivers for Life is supported by HSBC Water Programme.



The much celebrated walk was flagged off from two locations. Mr. Sanjay Kumar, IAS, District Magistrate in the presence of Mr. Praveen Mishra, Additional District Magistrate along with Mr. Suresh Babu, Director, River Basins & Water Policy, WWF-India flagged off the walk from the Block Office, Moradabad. They were also joined by several other government officials and key government dignitaries. The second flag off took place at the Ramganga Bridge, Katghar and was led by Mr. S.K. Singh Moradabad Municipal Commissioner, Mr. B B Banerjee, Additional Municipal Commissioner, officials of the Pollution Control Board and members of civil society. Other dignitaries who were present included Shehar Emam, Mr. Ramdas, Mr. K.K. Gupta, Sardar Gurbinder Singh, Block District Officers, Rotary Elite Moradabad, other leading civil society organizations, technical experts & practitioners, representatives from industries (brass), gram pradhans of the neighboring villages, college & school students and media professionals. 



The walk which saw active participation by all, paved its way from Block Office, covering Ambika Prasad Inter College, Thana Nagfani, Nawabpura Ghosian, Kaharon Ka Mandir, Jama Mazid Chauraha, Rishikul Inter College while finally culminating at Kali Mandir. Diverse set of participants wearing blue caps which stated ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’, waved blue colored flags signifying a pristine blue vision for Ramganga river, distributed pamphlets and sang slogans based on ‘Ramganga Conservation’. A friendly ghariyal mascot (a freshwater crocodile) was seen interacting with the public, thereby informing the people about the diverse set of aquatic biodiversity which exists in the upper reaches of Ramganga.



At Kali Mandir, one witnessed hundreds of participants taking pledge and signing-up to become ‘Ramganga Mitra’. The pledge which was led by Mr. Sanjay Kumar, District Magistrate, Moradabad made the participants undertake complete ownership of the well being of the ecological health of Ramganga thereby making them active agents of change. Encouraging this initiative, the District Magistrate added, “It’s the time that we, as environment conscientious citizens of this district and particularly of this city, take responsibility to conserve and protect Ramganga on World Earth Day. The district administration of Moradabad is committed to join hands with the stakeholders to bring glory back to the river. Today, lets all pledge to protect and conserve this river. With this zest, enthusiasm and belief, that day is not far when the citizens of Moradabad will be able to achieve their vision for a healthy Ramganga and have their own set of ghariyals and dolphins dancing in the river!” 



Mr. S.K. Singh Moradabad Municipal Commissioner, who flagged off the walk from Ramganga bridge added, “Communities, industries and Government need to develop a shared vision and work together to bring the river back to life. Communities need to think on how to be water efficient in their households, whereas industries need to look at ways of improving productivity with low water consumption and no pollution.” 



Ramganga River– a major tributary of the Ganga presents some complex and nested challenges in water resource management. The upper reaches of the Ramganga River (above Harewali Barrage) is inhabited by endemic and endangered aquatic species including ghariyals, dolphins, mahasir etc. However, the 300km stretch of the river, from Kalagarh to where it meets the Ganga, is lean, badly polluted and demands immediate attention. This river is impacted by abstraction and diversion of flows, unsustainable water use (surface and ground), increasing water footprint of cities, industries and agriculture leading to pollution and degradation in aquatic biodiversity. Growing water footprint of cities and industries has been a matter of concern. Water use in major cities as well as industries has gone up resulting in enhanced pollution. 



“It is heartening to see so many citizens of Moradabad coming together offering their full support for the river’s restoration. We look forward to engaging with this multi-stakeholder group, including the State Government of Uttar Pradesh, and people of Moradabad to work a multi dimensional approach comprising water management, sustainable agriculture, pollution abatement and community involvement for the revival of this degraded river. This walk is part of WWF-India’s campaign titled – ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’ which envisions for reviving hope and inspiring action to restore Ramganga river. This Ramganga walk was first step towards connecting people of Moradabad back to their river. We strongly believe that if we all work together, the river’s health can be restored!” added Mr. Suresh Babu, Director River Basins & Water Policy, WWF-India.



The ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’ campaign aims for engaging stakeholders (communities, industries and government officials) to aspire for taking complete ownership for the ecological wellbeing of the river and working towards its restoration. WWF-India’s Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers programme has been working on Ganga conservation since 2007 and envisions it as a healthy river system that is rich in biodiversity, and aims to provide long term water security to communities, businesses and nature. The programme also endeavors to maximize and implement effective basin management in the Ramganga river– the first major tributary of the Ganga. 



“Seeing hundreds of young adults, government officials and citizens of Moradabad coming together for Ramganga, ensures this river’s hopeful tomorrow. This walk would inspire many others to stand for their river and work towards its restoration!” said an elated Sardar Gurbinder Singh, one of the leading social activists of Moradabad city.
