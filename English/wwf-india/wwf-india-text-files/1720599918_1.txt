Overwhelming support for the inaugural World Wildlife Day on 3 March 2014 has come from countries across all regions and organisations dealing with agriculture, development, nature conservation and maritime matters to Customs, justice and police as well as the economy, finance, trade and tourism. Civil society groups from across the globe and many committed individuals have also expressed their enthusiastic support for wildlife as has the private sector. 



"While the threats to wildlife are great, we can reduce them through our collective efforts. On this inaugural World Wildlife Day, I urge all sectors of society to end illegal wildlife trafficking and commit to trading and using wild plants and animals sustainably and equitably", U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said in declaring the inaugural World Wildlife Day. CITES Secretary-General John E. Scanlon said “We are thrilled by the enthusiasm and overwhelming support for wildlife coming from so many places and people. It gives us great hope that we can secure a sustainable future for wild plants and animals, as well as for ourselves”.
