WWF-India’s camera traps give a sneak peak into the diverse wildlife of Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary, Darjeeling, India



Senchal Wildlfie Sanctuary

It may be small in size, covering an area of 38.60 km2, but the Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), nestled in the Darjeeling hills in West Bengal has a rich history behind it. In fact, it is perhaps one of the oldest wildlife sanctuaries of India, being declared as one as far back as 1915! It also holds great importance for Darjeeling, as the two lakes within the sanctuary are the primary drinking water sources for the town. Despite its small size, the sanctuary is home to a varied high altitude flora and fauna including the Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus), and Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis).



The Eyes in the Jungle

In partnership with the West Bengal Forest Department, WWF-India initiated a camera trapping study in the sanctuary. The study was conducted in two phases with each phase lasting about 45 days. 



The aim of the camera trapping exercise was to study the distribution patterns of the Himalayan black bear and analyse its habitat. In addition, the study will also determine the scale and tendency of human-bear conflict.



What the Cameras Saw

The camera traps revealed a wide variety of wild denizens inhabiting the sanctuary. From the ubiquitous barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak) to the lesser known Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar). From the characteristic red faced Assamese macaque to the beautifully coloured yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula), the camera trap photos gave a sneak peak into the diverse wildlife of Senchal WLS. The Himalayan black bear with it characteristic white chest mark and the target species for this study was also captured by the cameras in good numbers at different locations within the sanctuary.



Sanjeeb Pradhan, Senior Project Officer, WWF-India Darjeeling Field Office elaborates, “If we know the areas frequented by the Himalayan black bears we can undertake plantation of more fruiting trees in such places. It is believed that this will increase the food sources for the bears and help in reducing conflict as they won’t wander out of the sanctuary in search of food.”



Mitigating Human-Bear Conflict

One of the main reasons for conflict between bears and humans in Senchal WLS is because of locals venturing into the sanctuary to collect fodder for their livestock. The camera trap results can help determine the locations most frequented by bears. Such data can then be used to sensitize the locals about the need of avoiding such areas to reduce conflict. 



In addition to the camera trap study, WWF-India’s Darjeeling Field Office is also conducting a survey in the villages surrounding the sanctuary to assess the level of human-bear conflict within them.



Deependra Sunar, Project Officer and Pemba Tshering Bhutia, Field Officer of WWF-India are undertaking both the camera trap study and the village survey.



Future Directions

The long term aim of the camera trap study and village survey is to determine the scale of conflict, how to solve it and ultimately help develop a conservation plan for Senchal WLS in partnership with the Forest Department. 



As Mr. Bhuwan Giri, Range Officer, Senchal WLS, East concludes, “Camera traps are being used for the first time in this sanctuary to understand the habit and habitats of Himalayan black bear. The findings of this project will be crucial in the process of establishing Senchal as a black bear sanctuary in future.” Surveying Senchal
