Survey Planned to Understand the Pollution Threats posed in the River’s Restoration
District Magistrate of Moradabad, Shri Sanjay Kumar (IAS) conducted an inspection of Ramganga river along with senior government officials, including the City Commissioner, Shri S.K. Singh and WWF-India’s experts. The objective of the survey cum inspection was to identify the key threats adversely impacting the river’s ecological wellbeing, thereby making its water importable for domestic consumption. The survey which began from Vivekanad Hospital, upstream of the city ended at Khatghar Railway Bridge, Moradabad, while crossing drains from MIT, TDI, Chakkar Ki Mallak along with witnessing dumping of sewage from other major drains of the city. 



Moradabad city generates about 133 million litres per day of domestic sewage, i.e. 149 litres per person of waste water. Currently, the city does not have a sewerage treatment system in place, and all of this waste is disposed in the river Ramganga. 2/3rd of the city’s waste is carried to the river by 5 major drains of Moradabad. The survey also highlighted the pollution load brought in by Dhela river, adding further ecological degradation of Ramganga.



The survey was part of the ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’ campaign, initiated by WWF-India’s Rivers for Life programme for Ramganga’s restoration in the city of Moradabad, in partnership with its District Administration. The revival strategy for the river envisions for communities, industries and Government to work together to bring the river back to life (improved ecological health). The programme has devised a detailed awareness generation activities calendar as part of the restoration plan that includes River Trails or River surveys and nature walks to expose local community members, young adults and Government officials to the existing threats to the river and inform/involve/engage diverse communities living across Ramganga basin for taking complete ownership for the ecological wellbeing of the river. 



“This survey has yet again highlighted the fact that this river plays a major role in the lives of the community people living across its basin, thereby playing a vital role in their respective lives. Synergized work plans and working together with members of the civil society and community groups is a key aspect of Ramganga revival strategy. We all need to work together to achieve a collaborative effort for the river basin management in order to restore the river. We also feel that by fixing a small stretch of the river’s pollution, there can be a marked improvement in its health,” added Shri. Sanjay Kumar (IAS), District Magistrate Moradabad.
