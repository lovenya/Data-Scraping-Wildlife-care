New Delhi: WWF-India and Tetra Pak today concluded their three-year-long “Young Climate Savers” programme with a closing meet held at WWF-India. The event witnessed participation from the eleven schools that have been part of this awareness raising initiative. 



What started as a simple awareness programme on climate change and energy for students has today turned them into Young Climate Savers geared up to tackle the impacts of climate change in cities across India. Young Climate Savers was a climate change and lifestyle education programme based on sustainable development and people’s participation. The programme was a collaborative effort of WWF-India and Tetra Pak. It was launched in 2007 and has targeted more than 2,50,000 students directly and indirectly across 10 cities in India. 



A short presentation on YCS reflected the three phase development of the project and evolvement of various state initiatives during the programme. It was followed by discussions about the three years of YCS programme: its successes, results and remarks from teachers, students and parents from all over the country. 



On this occasion the Grow a Green Gene Book was also released. This book talks about the need to make shifts in one’s attitude in our day to day life for living a greener lifestyle. 



Acknowledging the support from schools, teachers, students and Tetra Pak, Mr. Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF- India said, “Such initiatives provide an opportunity to understand the tremendous power that the youth of today possesses. It’s encouraging to see the students come up with such innovative projects in their respective cities. I congratulate all Young Climate Savers.”



Tetra Pak South Asia Markets Communications and Environment Director Jaideep Gokhale said, “Children today are aware of the drastic changes taking place in the environment and seek out opportunities to make a difference. Tetra Pak is proud to be part of an initiative that gives children the chance to become the agents of change and promote sustainability.”
