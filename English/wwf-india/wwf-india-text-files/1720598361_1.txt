New Delhi, March 20, 2007: The world’s top water suppliers - rivers on every continent - are drying-out threatening severe water shortages. Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever, says WWF. 



In its latest report, World’s Top 10 Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (March 22) the global conservation organization lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of over extraction, climate change, pollution and dams. 



“All the rivers in the report symbolize the freshwater crisis, signaled for years, but the alarm is falling on deaf ears,” says Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India. “Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.” 



Two of the ten rivers are in the Indian subcontinent – Ganges and Indus which are severely impacted by over extraction and climate change respectively. The other rivers are Yangtze, Mekong, and Salween in Asia, Europe’s Danube, the Americas’ La Plata and Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa’s Nile-Lake Victoria and Australia’s Murray-Darling. 



The Ganges is facing serious threat owing to increased water withdrawals. In India, barrages control all of the tributaries to the Ganges and divert roughly 60% of river flow to large scale irrigation. Over-extraction for agriculture in the Ganges has caused the reduction in surface water resources, increasing dependence on ground water, loss of water-based livelihoods and the destruction of habitat for 109 fish species and other aquatic and amphibian fauna. 



The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people’s livelihoods. 



“Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,” Mr. Singh adds. “Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.” 



In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given the resources to make them work, says WWF. 



“The freshwater crisis is bigger than the ten rivers listed in this report but it mirrors the extent to which unabated development is jeopardizing nature’s ability to meet our growing demands,” says Mr. Singh. “We must change our mindset now or pay the price in the not so distant future.” 



WWF-India, through its Freshwater and Wetlands programme, works for sustainable management of wetlands for biodiversity conservation and human well being across the country. Additionally as part of an upcoming regional initiative, WWF-India is working towards generating better understanding of climate change impacts on Ganga River ecosystems and vulnerable communities for the development of adaptation strategies helping towards minimizing impacts upon ecosystems, people and livelihoods.
