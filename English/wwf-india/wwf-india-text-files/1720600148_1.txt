New Delhi: Sony India today announced its partnership with WWF-India to undertake conservation initiatives for the red panda and the snow leopard in western Arunachal Pradesh, as a component of Sony’s broader CSR objectives. Additionally, Sony has also lent equipment and technical support towards the production of audio visual content showcasing WWF-India’s tiger conservation programmes across different landscapes in the country.

 

The snow leopard is one of the world’s most elusive species, often nicknamed “the ghost of the mountains”, owing to its habitat preferences at altitudes over 3000 meters, and their rare sightings. In India, snow leopards occur in J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Snow leopards are listed as “endangered” on IUCN Red List of threatened species, and are often hunted in several Asian countries that promote the trading of fur, bones, meat and various body parts for medicinal and other purposes. Within India, red pandas are found in Sikkim, northern West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh and it is the state animal of Sikkim. They presently number less than 10,000 individuals worldwide. Both the aforementioned species share similar threats due to poaching and degradation of their habitat, with red pandas also facing the additional threat posed by free ranging dogs.

 

The partnership will support the conservation projects of WWF-India in the western Arunachal landscape through initiatives being conducted at three Community Conserved Areas (CCAs). It entails assessing and establishing baseline data on the population status of the two species, their habitat requirements and the threats they face, as well as develop and implement effective human-wildlife conflict prevention and management measures, specifically in the case of snow leopards.

 

Additionally, the projects will focus on the development and promotion of sustainable livelihoods for local communities in these regions so that they are not solely dependent on forest resources, thereby mitigating the potential for human-wildlife conflict and reducing the degree of habitat loss for these species. The projects will strengthen the existing CCA management committees through capacity building efforts, supply of resources, training, and advocacy for favorable policies at the state level.

 

Sony and WWF-India will also work together to produce audio visual content showcasing tiger conservation programmes implemented by WWF-India in conjunction with government agencies and civil society organizations.The goal of this audio visual content is to bring much needed public support and political will to strengthen tiger conservation efforts in India. The content will aim to highlight the issues that threaten tiger survival, interventions, counter-threats being conducted, and narrate success stories thus far in the battle for conservation.

 

Speaking on the initiative, Sanjay Bhatnagar, National Head, Corporate Human Resources, Sony India said, “The rare Snow Leopards and Red Pandas need much attention due to their threatened existence and we are glad to have the opportunity to partner with WWF-India for their conservation. Sony has the technical know-how and equipment such as camera and projectors to enable documenting research work, creating videos and spreading awareness towards this cause. The project is also extended for the cause of sustained livelihoods for the local community. Towards this effort, we hope to make a positive difference to the lives and survival of these species and community at large. We are glad to have partnered with WWF for the humble cause of conserving endangered species – the snow leopards and red pandas.”

 

Welcoming the support of Sony India, Mr. Ravi Singh, SG & CEO WWF-India said, “WWF-India looks forward to the opportunity to work with market leaders such as Sony on conservation awareness projects. It is our goal to contribute towards the much needed strength and support of the community conservation areas in the Western Arunachal Landscape. This will enable us to scale up and carry out conservation objectives for key wildlife species in this region -- the snow leopard and the red panda. We are also eager to work with Sony on films for children and communities to spread awareness on tigers and other wildlife conservation initiatives across the country. It is encouraging to see Sony participating in such important themes."
