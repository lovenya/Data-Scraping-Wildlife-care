Poaching of wildlife in the dense forests of Simlipal Tiger Reserve, located near Baripada in Odisha in eastern India has emerged as one of the most significant threats to various wildlife species in the tiger reserve. Abundant with natural resources and wild flora and fauna, Simlipal is home to Tigers, Elephants, Leopards, various deer species, Gaur, Giant Squirrel, and bird species like the Red Jungle Fowl, Hill Mynah, Peacock, Alexandrine Parakeet, Crested Serpent Eagle, reptile species like the King Cobra among other wildlife species.



Illegal wildlife trade that has evolved into an organized criminal activity extends beyond borders and threatens our national security in many ways. It is therefore imperative to enforce the laws stringently and take the actions tactically to combat poaching. TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network, in collaboration with the Orissa Forest Department (OFD) organized a specialized capacity-building training programme for the enforcement officials of the Simlipal Tiger Reserve and the police forces. The training programme is aimed at strengthening the skills of the enforcement officials, enhancing tactical collaboration and understanding the wildlife crimes and illegal trade in curbing these growing threats. 



The workshop held on 22-23 January 2014 was attended by about 90 officials of the Odisha Forest Department, the police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). 



Mr Anup Kumar Naik, IFS, Regional Chief Conservator of Forests cum Field Director of Simlipal Tiger Reserve, Baripada , Odisha, while inaugurating the training workshop said that this type of training helps to inculcate knowledge among the ground staff on present scenarios of wildlife crimes. It provides deep insight into the current trade dynamics and new methods adopted by the illegal trade operators that cause poaching and illegal killing of targeted species in protected areas.



Mr Nikhil Kumar Khanoriya, IPS, SSP, Baripada, Odisha who attended the inaugural sessions and deputed a large number of police officials for the training said it is necessary for the police and the forest to cooperate in curbing wildlife crime. The support provided by the police further augments the initiatives undertaken by the forest department and enables enforcement agencies to work together. 



Dr Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC in India who led the training programme with his colleague Mr Dhruba Jyoti Dutta informed the participants that TRAFFIC has recognized the need for training the enforcement officials and prioritized this workshop for Simlipal in Odisha due to the reserve’s strategic location and specific vulnerability. 



The participants were provided an overview of what is meant by illegal wildlife trade, the current trade dynamics and international illegal wildlife trade trends. They were also introduced to various latest tools and techniques available to the enforcement agencies in fighting this crime. An integral part of the training was focused on understanding the use of forensics in successful wildlife crime investigation. The participants were also taken through various domestic and international laws and conventions that have implications on illegal wildlife trade. Resource material related to this was also distributed among the participants.



Dr Niraj, further added, “Capacity-building training programmes have been conducted in the past and have had a significant impact on the enforcement initiatives of various agencies. It is important to bring various agencies together to share experience and knowledge. We appreciate the support provided by the police and forest department for this training programme”.

Mr Varun Kapoor, Inspector General of Police, an important TRAFFIC resource person conducted an exclusive session on police techniques in combating wildlife crimes, tools and techniques of intelligence collection, collation for improving preventive and investigative techniques for combating wildlife crimes. 



The event was covered in national newspapers and electronic media. It was impactful for it created a buzz among the participants that the Odisha Forest Department headquarters lost no time in sending a quick request to TRAFFIC to conduct a similar training programme for a multiple enforcement agency groups of the state.
