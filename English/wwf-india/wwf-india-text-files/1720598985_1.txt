New Delhi,  With an aim to promote sustainable wood trade practices in the country, WWF- India today announced the first ten SMEs that are now the members of the Global Forest and Trade Network (GFTN) initiative. 



After a series of successful business to business (B2B) meetings, training workshops, seminars and field visits, WWF- India was instrumental in bringing together, for the first time, ten SME’s from all over the country to pledge their support for responsible wood trade. 



In India, the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) play a pivotal role in the promotion of trade and economic development of the nation. By recognizing this, WWF- India has become a partner in implementing a project “Sustainable and Responsible Trade Promoted to Wood Processing SMEs through Forest and Trade Networks in China, India and Vietnam” with the support of the European Commission under its SWITCH ASIA programme.  



The ten Indian SMEs - including Basant Exports, Jodhpur; Manglam Arts, Jaipur; Attic Products, Jodhpur; Heritage, Jaipur; Pink City Furnitures, Jaipur; Atheena Exports, Kochi; Turakhia Overseas Pvt Ltd, Gujarat; Teddy Exports, Madurai; Royal Wood Handicrafts, Nagina, Uttar Pradesh; Star Handicrafts, Nagina, Uttar Pradesh- who supply wood and handicraft products in the global markets, are the first ten SMEs indentified from India to become the participants in this internationally renowned trade network.  



WWF has established the Global Forest and Trade Network (GFTN) to facilitate trade links between companies committed to achieving and supporting responsible forestry and thereby creates market conditions that help conserve the world’s forests while providing economic and social benefits for the businesses and people that depend on them. GFTN-India was launched on 3rd December 2008 with a view to facilitate Indian companies to join this global network.  



This initiative is a part of the project supported by the European Commission under its SWITCH Asia programme in three States, (Kerala, and Rajasthan & Uttar Pradesh) with the aim to build capacity amongst the small and medium scale wood processors and traders to meet the global market standards.



A major objective of this project in India to build capacity among SMEs in wood processing sectors of Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh States to provide certified sustainable forest products to national and international markets. The increased demand for forest certification and environmental measures (e.g. The Lacey Act in US, FLEGT in Europe) are likely to affect the economic prospects of many industries, particularly wood based industries, plantations, including farm forestry/agro-forestry systems in India unless adequate preparations are taken to comply with such measures. This is why a need was felt to build the capacity of SMEs in order to comply with the global standards and enhance market access. 



Addressing the multi-stakeholder audience and media a the launch, Dr. T. R. Manoharan, Head of Forestry Programme of WWF-India explained the benefits of GFTN, “GFTN-India is a part of the global alliance, established with the objective of promoting and facilitating environmentally, economically and socially sound forest conservation and management practices in India.”



On behalf of the European Union, I am pleased to learn about the progress of the GFTN India programme, which we are happy to support. I am also encouraged to see the participation of companies, especially the SMEs who have committed themselves to take part in this initiative. I am sure that with the active involvement of these operators, the objective of GFTN will be achieved” said Mr. Robert Donkers, Minister Counselor, Environment, Delegation of the European Union to India and also the Chief Guest of the event
