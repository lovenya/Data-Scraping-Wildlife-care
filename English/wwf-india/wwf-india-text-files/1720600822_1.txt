The National Interpretation Working Group (NIWG) formation ensured that all due processes, communications and actions taken were properly documented. TransGraph Consulting has been appointed as the secretariat for the NIWG.



The RSPO National Interpretation document for India on RSPO Principles and Criteria 2018 (P&C 2018) has been developed after a comprehensive process which included two consultation rounds with working group members.
