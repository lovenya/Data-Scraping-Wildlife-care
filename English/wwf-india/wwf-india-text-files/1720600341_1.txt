For the first time in the Ramganga, 82 freshwater turtle hatchlings were released from the banks of Bareilly. The release event, part of a turtle conservation project under WWF-India’s ‘Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers’ supported by the HSBC Water Programme was conducted in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department, District Administration and local communities. The event also witnessed the coming together of school students from Rohilkhand Nature Club, Bareilly and 60 Ramganga Mitras from Bareilly, Moradabad and Shahjahanpur who have been involved in ongoing river conservation activities of the programme in their respective districts.



Chief Conservator of Forests, Ruhelkhand Zone, Bareilly, Mr. M.P. Singh added, “It is very important for people to understand the role that turtles play in maintaining the ecological health of the river. Their awareness of what this small species can do, will motivate them to participate in protecting them from threats like poaching. It gives me much happiness to know that a turtle conservation programme that brings together various stakeholders including communities, the District Administration, the Forest Department, is being conducted in Bareilly. The Forest Department will continue to extend its support to WWF-India to ensure that conservation initiatives like these are sustained”



In April 2015, 8 turtle nests were located in pallage fields along a stretch of approximately 90 km of the Ramganga and 102 eggs were rescued with the help of 7 riverbed farmers who volunteered in locating these nests and transporting them safely to a turtle hatchery constructed on the banks of the river at Firozpur village. By 15th June 2015, the eggs hatched and 82 hatchlings survived out of which 78 hatchlings belong to the Three Striped Roof Turtle (Batagur dhongoka) species and 4 hatchlings belong to Indian Tent Turtle (Panghshura tentoria) species. We are grateful to the District Administration, the Forest Department and the local communities who have supported us in this initiative and we look forward to their continuous support in the coming months said Dr. Asghar Nawab, Senior Manager, Biodiversity, Rivers. Wetlands and Water Policy WWF-India while talking about the journey of the in-situ turtle conservation project in Bareilly.



After their hatching in June, the 82 turtles were kept in a temporary pond constructed at the Additional District Magistrate (E) Mr. Arun Kumar’s residence compound in Bareilly for six months before being shifted to a pond at Mayur Van Chetna Kendra. The hatchlings have been taken care of in the center since December till their release into the wild today back at Firozpur village on the banks of the Ramganga.



Additional District Magistrate (E) Mr. Arun Kumar in his heartwarming account of living with the 82 hatchlings for six months shared, “It was an eye-opening experience for me and my family to watch these turtles grow and to learn about their unique behavior in such detail. We also had the opportunity to share this knowledge with school children and other people who would come frequently to see these hatchlings. A year ago through various panchayat level meetings it was our collective dream that a hatchery would be set up in Bareilly. With today’s release of the hatchlings back into the river, that dream has come true and we are a step closer to our vision of a healthy Ramganga”



Divisional Forest Officer, Bareilly,  Mr. Dharam Singh shared, “I would like to congratulate each one of you Mitras gathered here today for participating in such a programme and I would urge you to continue lending us your support in looking out for these nests in your fields to rescue the turtle eggs. Initiatives such as these require continuous efforts from all stakeholders. Children especially are key change agents and if they learn the importance of conservation at a young age, we can look forward to a future where people make better choices to protect the environment.” 



 “Watching these little turtles make their way into the river makes me feel responsible for their well being, awareness campaigns like the one we conducted during the Choubari Mela, provide a good opportunity to inform people about the importance of conserving biodiversity in the Ramganga” said Praveen Bhandari, a Ramganga Mitra who owns her own NGO in Bareilly.



As part of the in-situ turtle conservation project started in 2013 under the ‘Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers’ programme, WWF-India along with the Uttar Pradesh Forest department and local communities, works to conserve three species of freshwater turtles including, Three Stripped Turtle (Batagur dhongoka), Brown Roofed Turtle (Pangshura smithii) and Indian Tent Turtle (Pangshura tentoria circumdata) along with 4 other indicator species namely the Gharial, Dolphin, Mahseer and Otter. In Hastinapur, WWF-India in collaboration with Uttar Pradesh Forest Department (UPFD) is already in its fourth year of Turtle Conservation Project wherein more than 1000 turtle hatchlings have been released into the Ganga so far. The initiative in Bareilly is a first of a kind along the Ramganga stretch. The Ramganga welcomes its first batch of rescued turtle hatchlings from the banks of Bareilly
