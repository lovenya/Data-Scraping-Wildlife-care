The CITES Secretariat has urged Parties to publish results of scientific research on correlations between use of the internet and rate of wildlife crime and share these results with the CITES Secretariat. The CITES Secretariat urges Parties to assess the extent of and trends in commerce of CITES listed species via the Internet and submit such information for analysis. Any changes in trade routes and methods of shipment that have been observed as a result of increased use of the internet to promote trade in wildlife would also constitute the information the Secretariat is seeking.
