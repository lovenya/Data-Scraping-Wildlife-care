New Delhi: WWF-India in collaboration with UP state forest department and University of Tokyo has for the first time ever in the world launched an underwater study of Gharial behavior with the use of bio-loggers. 

Two Gharial- a 4 year old and 2 year old- were identified for this project. The Gharial were brought from Kukrail Breeding centre Lucknow where they had successfully undergone testing under laboratory conditions. The animals were released into the Ganga at Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, U.P.

Ecological studies on Gharial have been conducted earlier, but the use of bio-loggers will help contribute to their conservation and better understanding of their under water behavior and ecology.

Speaking on the occasion Mr Ravi Singh SG&CEO ,WWF-India said “ the data collected through the bio-loggers would prove to be beneficial in conservation of these highly endangered species.
