WWF-India's waste management efforts at, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve protects local forests and tigers
In India, people often associate the tranquility and natural beauty of forests to represent spirituality. In ancient times, hermits and ascetics of various religious faiths, including rishis, munis, fakirs and monks, would often frequent forests. As a consequence of this association, several religious sites have been built in such areas acquiring great religious significance over the years. 



One such religious site– the Siddha Baba Temple, is located in India’s most recently declared Tiger Reserve – the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
The Pilibhit Tiger Reserve
The Pilibhit T.R.is filled with a wealth of biodiversity including tigers, leopards, hog deer, hispid hare and the Bengal florican among several other species. These forests are a part of WWF-India’s Terai Arc Landscape (TAL), which encompasses an area of 52,000 km2across Uttarakhand and eastwards to Bihar.The forests of Pilibhit act as a fulcrum linking the Shukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in Nepal with the Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary in India.



Although the recent declaration of this area as a Tiger Reserve bodes well for tigers of the region, several threats continue to threaten their long-term survival. The religious attraction of the aforementioned Siddha Baba Temple has resulted in an ever-increasing influx of people into the forests, which invariably leads to the creation of garbage in the form of plastic and other solid waste. This pressure from a large human gathering during the season of worship poses a severe risk to the Reserve’s integrity as a Protected Area.
Siddha BabaTemple: Pilgrims and Tourists Polluting Forests
During the annual season of pilgrimage observed between May and June, a large number of people congregate in the area. Traditionally, visits to the area are, marked by tying knots in the nearby grasses, with each knot signifying their wishes. Return visits are usually observed if a person's wish comes true, upon which they return to offer food to their friends, relatives and family members, to complete the ritual. 



Gatherings have been estimated to have over 1500-2000 people who visit the area, invariably leading to increased littering of plastic packets and other garbage. Enterprising local businesses have also sprung up in the area to sell to these large crowds, also creating their own waste, all of which ultimately pollutes the forests. The primary issue observed has been the prevalence of plastic garbage that is littered in the forests.
The ‘Towards Zero Plastic’ Initiative
In June 2010, WWF-India carried out an initiative to promote a ban on the use of plastic in the area. The initiative was undertaken in partnership with the Indian scouts team of Pilibhit and volunteers from local communities and a joint action team was formed. Pamphlets, posters and signage were created and distributed to create awareness amongst the pilgrims and visitors on the hazards posed by disposing waste in the forests. On various occasions, volunteers monitored the various gatherings in the region and initiated dialogue with visitors who were observed to be carrying plastic materials, offering to dispose of the materials on their behalf. In some rare cases when gatherings did not adhere to notices regarding plastics, volunteers would also confiscate them entirely, in these extreme cases. Further to these initiatives, WWF-India also partnered with local schools to educate and mobilize students to help spread awareness on the issue in the form of awareness rallies and clean up exercises.
‘Towards Zero Plastic’: Attaining Success
Although initial interventions were met with hostility from pilgrims and worshippers, the joint action team was ultimately successful in implementing a ban on the use of plastic. In the past 4 years, the use of plastic has been reduced by approximately 95%, as a direct consequence of frequent inspections and vigilance by local forest officials and WWF-India volunteers. Regular checking schedules were established for this purpose, especially during the pilgrimage season, and pilgrims were searched to ensure that they were not carrying or disposing plastic in and around the forest.At present, the team is working towards the elimination of plastic waste consisting of snack food wrappers and other such sources of waste.



Dr. Rajeev Mishra, DFO, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve remarked that, “The plan to eradicate non-biodegradable waste has been very successful. This program has been very beneficial in reducing the use of polythene in the forest and has conveyed a message to people that there is another agency apart from the forest department who keeps vigil on destructive activities of visitors in the forest”.



Local shops and establishments in the area have also given up the use of plastics. Instead, the ‘Towards Zero Plastic’ initiative has led to the use of stainless steel plates, glasses, and vessels. Furthermore, vehicles in the region have been discouraged from playing loud music in an effort to curb high levels of noise pollution that was a potential source of disturbance for local wildlife.
Impact on Tiger Conservation
The forests from the said area are reported to have tiger movement and we hope that reducing pressures on forests will ultimately help them.



“We started this annual campaign in the year 2010 in collaboration with the forest department. Since then, the biggest challenge has been to promote a change in attitudes in the people visiting the fair. At present, it is re-assuring to see the good condition of the forest even after a month long fair and it appears that our efforts have yielded great success” remarked Mr. Mudit Gupta, Landscape Coordinator, WWF-India. 



At present, there still exists a need for greater regulation and rules to govern the visiting of tourists and pilgrims to the region in a way that enables peaceful co-existence with local wildlife. Ensuring effective patrolling by forest staff is also a vital step to prevent issues, which create direct or indirect disturbances.
