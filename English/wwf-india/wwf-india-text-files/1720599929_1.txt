Solar street lighting at Manas National Park could help prevent human-wildlife conflictWith the twin objectives of preventing human-wildlife conflict and promotion of green energy, the Manas Ever Welfare Society (MEWS) in Assam in partnership with WWF–India, installed four solar streetlights along the southern boundary of the Manas National Park.



Situated at the foothills of the Bhutan Himalayas in Baksa and Chirang districts of Assam, the Manas National Park is home to a variety of wildlife - like one horned rhinos, tigers, wild water buffalo, Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden langur and pygmy hog. The park is surrounded by thickly populated villages to its south. Park authorities are often faced with the dual challenge of protecting the wildlife as well as ensuring minimal loss of harvested crop from animal depredations. 



After a careful survey of stray elephant movement and community consultation, MEWS identified 20 critical locations along the southern boundary road under Basbari range of the Park in a stretch of about 12 km, where the lights have been put up.



The lights, which will help illuminate the entire stretch from Gyati gaon to Katajhar at night, have been installed in the villages of Roharpam, Barengabari, Katajhar Bathan and Daoraibari.



The latest installations are in addition to the six solar lights already installed under a project supported by the ‘SEED Division’ of the Department of Science & Technology, New Delhi. This is the first time that solar street lights have been setup around Manas and this initiative was a direct result of constant interactions between members of MEWS and WWF-India staff for new ideas to reduce human-wildlife conflict in the area. The solar-powered streetlights will not only facilitate safe movement of forest personnel and fringe villagers along the park’s southern boundary, but will also help reduce crop damage in the adjoining areas. 



Ms. Sonali Ghose, IFS and Deputy Field Director of Manas National Park said that this initiative will lead the park to a new dimension and remains hopeful that other national parks will also adopt the new technology to help address depredation problems. “It will not only help to reduce man and wild animal conflict, but will also help improve the park-people relationship,” Ms. Ghose added.



Mohan Pathak, a villager from Roharpam, who is actively involved in the installation process and maintenance of the solar panels, said, “Stray animal sightings in our village vicinity have come down considerably since the first set of lights were installed earlier in 2013.” Mr. Pathak, who suffered losses himself last year after leopards took away three of his five goats, said every week he travels to neighbouring communities to give a demonstration of the solar panels and help introduce the new technology.



Haripad Medhi, a forest ranger at Palsiguri camp of the National Park said that these lights would help them to do patrolling duty more efficiently and confidently at night.



WWF-India will continue to work with park authorities, local communities and NGOs to develop and implement such long term solutions tackling human-wildlife conflict around the World Heritage Site of Manas National Park.
