Every year, on May 9 and 10, World Migratory Bird Day is celebrated across the globe to highlight the importance of conserving migratory birds and their habitats. This year, WWF-India in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Protection, Government of Jammu & Kashmir organised an awareness camp for the school students of Ladakh. As part of this, an inter-school painting competition on the theme ‘Migratory Birds and their Habitat’ was organised at Lamdon Model Senior Secondary School, Leh.



In addition, the children were taken on a bird watching trip to Shey Marshes near Leh, where were introduced to various bird watching techniques. They got to see various migratory birds which visit Ladakh in the summer months.



The camp helped the children learn about migratory birds and their habitats in high altitude areas like Ladakh. The programme was coordinated by Ms. Nisa Khatoon and Mr. Phuntsog Tashi, Project officers at the WWF-India Field Office at Leh.



At present, migratory birds are under severe threat due to habitat degradation owing to unplanned developmental activities and the emerging problem of climate change.



Shri Saleem-ul-Haq, Wildlife Warden of Leh was the main resource person during the programme.
