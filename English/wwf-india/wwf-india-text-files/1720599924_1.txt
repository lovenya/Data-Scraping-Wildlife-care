WWF-India, Shimla and India Water Portal celebrated the World Water Day with film screenings and interactions with students of the Bishop Cotton School (BCS), here today. Around 60 students of the school attended the event along with their teachers. 



‘Renukaji in Delhi’s taps’, a film by Kurush Canteenwala, talked about the possible impacts of the proposed Renuka dam project in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh. After watching the film, students questioned the necessity to build the dam that will quench the thirst of Delhi but will destroy the livelihood of local residents in Sirmaur. Manu Moudgil from India Water Portal briefed them on the reasons for water scarcity in Delhi. “Around 40 per cent of the water supplied in the national capital is lost during distribution. Also, it gets 800 mm of average annual rainfall which literally goes down the drain. If Delhi government can check the wastage and harvest rainwater, it won’t need to spend crores to build the dam and transport water from over 300 km,” he said.



Another film, ‘Green Warriors’ by Dr Gaurav Chhabra, focussed on a heritage pond in Chandigarh which was under threat of getting acquired for building a club for IAS officers. The film talked about the efforts of school students in preserving the pond which used to serve as their practical learning ground being home to a vast variety of flora and fauna. After watching the film, student participants discussed the need to conserve ponds all over India since they can help recharge groundwater. Aarti Gupta from WWF-Shimla, told the students about water harvesting structures in Shimla. “The demand on the natural resources is rising due to increasing population and tourist inflow. This is why it’s all the important to do our best in conserving water and energy,” she said.



Ravinder Kaul, the teacher incharge of the nature club at BCS, talked about rainwater harvesting structures on the campus and how the infrastructure helps them ward off water scarcity even during summer season besides reducing the water bill. WWF-India and India Water Portal also decided to collaborate for future activities, including film-making and comics workshops, around water in the city.



WWF-India also organized the film screenings and other activities at St Thomas School in the city and Government Degree College at Seema in Rohru. It was in 1993 that United Nations declared March 22 as World Water Day, since then several countries, including India, have been celebrating it. The theme for the year 2014 was ‘Energy and Water’.
