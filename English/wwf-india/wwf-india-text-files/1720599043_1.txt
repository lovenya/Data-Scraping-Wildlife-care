Civil society in Assam including NGOs, student organizations, media persons, WWF staff and the family members of the three abducted volunteers carried out a candlelight vigil on 13 February 2011 in Kokrajhar town demonstrating their concern and support for their early release. Contact has been made with the three boys and they are reported to be safe. WWF India continues to be in touch with their families who are coping bravely with the situation. We have also been in touch with the three female volunteers who were released on 08 February 2011. These girls have shown exemplary courage and expressed their keenness to continue to work for conservation even after their ordeal. State authorities and police continue to work towards speedy release of the volunteers. We thank the Bodoland Territorial Council, local administration, civil society groups, print and electronic media and others for their continued support towards resolving this crisis.
