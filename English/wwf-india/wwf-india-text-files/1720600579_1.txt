Indian Express has recently published an article on the seven years since establishment of the National Green Tribunal, titled 'Inside the NGT'. The article has covered NGT's journey of being a fast-track environment tribunal and its stringent approach to environmental issues around the country. It also comments on the limitations and shortcomings of the Tribunal considering the implementation status and its jurisdiction vis-a-vis the High Courts.



The data used in the article, other than the NGT website, has been sourced from an ongoing research study between CEL, WWF-India and Vidhi, Centre for Legal Policy. The study titled 'Civil Liability on environmental damage' is an attempt to critically map the trends of NGT's approach to civil liability. This was done primarily based on the methodology adopted by the tribunal in adjudicating on provisions of compensation and relief under the NGT Act 2010. The study is due to be published early next year.
