We in WWF India are greatly saddened at the passing of Padma Shri Sh. P K Sen of Covid.  Deeply committed to the cause of conservation, Shri Sen continued to contribute greatly to the endeavor to protect India’s wildlife and their habitat even after he left Government service post an illustrious career as an Indian Forest Service Officer. Outspoken and not one to mince his words when it came to conveying his concerns at the threats to our natural heritage when in Government or outside, Shri Sen’s passing leaves behind a big void in the conservation sector.
 
Even after he handed over the baton of Director of WWF India’s Tiger and Wildlife Division over a decade ago, Sh. Sen continued to be closely associated with WWF India as a sounding board and well-wisher.  His regular visits to the office, gradually reducing in frequency over the last three years as he grappled with multiple health challenges, will be cherished by staff members, who were often left marveling at his experiences, which he narrated with great humour and irreverence.
 
WWF India and the Indian conservation fraternity has lost a dear friend and member.
