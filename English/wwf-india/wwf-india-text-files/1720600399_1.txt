Meerut: The Uttar Pradesh Forest Department in association with WWF-India, initiated a process to prepare an aquatic biodiversity management plan for Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (HWLS). Declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in the 1980s, Hastinapur is quite unique with the presence of UP’s State animal (bara singha) and State bird (sarus crane). Spanning across an area of 2,073 km2, the sanctuary is home to several endangered fauna including Ganga River Dolphin, Gharial and several species of turtles. In addition River Ganga flows through 173 kilometer within the sanctuary offering rich habitats for Gharial, Ganga River Dolphins, many species of turtles and fishes.

 

This Workshop on “Devising a management plan for the freshwater habitats and species in the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary” was attended by over 100 participants from the Forest Department, local communities, researchers, NGOs, students and educationists from Bijnore, Muzzafarnagar, Meerut, JP Nagar and Hapur is supported by HSBC Water Programme. Inaugurating the workshop, Mr. Umendra Sharma (IFS), Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, UPFD said “This process of devising the management plan involving the key stakeholders will go a long way in developing a plan which will ensure sustainability of the HWLS by creating a sense of ownership amongst all. He suggested focusing on creating platforms for local stakeholders to engage in managing the HWLS and to develop monitoring mechanisms.”

 

Declared a sanctuary in 1986, the HWLS faces several threats which include land use changes and habitat destruction, including shrinkage of wetlands and marshes, lean flows in the Ganga, over fishing, sand extraction, pollution to name a few. Mr. Mukesh Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests Meerut said, “The wild life sanctuary lie in the Ganga Basin and conservation efforts will contribute to the larger objectives of the Ganga rejuvenation. Due to its proximity to Delhi eco-tourism opportunities will create livelihood opportunities for local communities and help conserving this important archaeological and biodiversity hotspot”. He said that the ongoing gharial and turtle conservation programme with WWF-India is a classic example of how community, civil society and Government partnership can yield benefits to nature. This model can be scaled up to address the threats. Mr Sushil Kumar Awasthi, Conservator of Forests said that there are many threats but the management plan should address issues around protection of flora/fauna, habitat destruction, eco-tourism and eco development.

 

Mr. Suresh Babu, Director, Rivers, Wetlands & Water Policy, WWF-India said “UPFD and WWF-India’s aquatic species programme which saw reintroduction of 606 gharials in Ganga in HWLS and turtle conservation programme highlighted the fact that local communities (villagers, fishermen, farmers) can play a crucial role in monitoring of the species and habitats. It is important to analyse the external threats (land use changes and changes in the flow regimes) and arrive at a mechanism to engage with various district administrations and line departments.” Today’s workshop is aimed at agreeing at the framework of the management plan and the process for developing the same.



Prof B.C Choudhury, Former Senior Scientist, WII shared his experience in developing the Chambal Sanctuary Management Plan and said this management plan will need to be for Ganga, floodplain mosaic in the Hastinapur landscape. He emphasized on the need for restoration and recovery plan, capacity building and institutional coordination as the landscape spreads over 5 districts.”

 

Mr Mahesh Chandra Gupta, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Rajasthan and Dr RK Sharma, Research Officer, Madhya Pradesh Forest Department, Dr Affifullah Khan, Aligarh Muslim University, Tarun Nair, ATREE, TK Roy shared their experiences. Lessons from National Tri State Chambal Management Plan were also discussed. A core group chaired by CCF Meerut and Working Group comprising 5 Divisional Forest Officers were formed to work on the Plan.
