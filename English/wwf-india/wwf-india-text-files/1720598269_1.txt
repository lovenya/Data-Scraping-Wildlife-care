Today, six of the seven living species of marine turtle are classified as “Endangered” or “Critically Endangered”. Concerted conservation efforts have seen turtle populations recover in some areas, but without urgent global action the future of these animals looks increasingly grim. 



Marine turtles have swum in the world’s oceans for over 100 million years. They are the only widely distributed marine reptiles and many species migrate for thousands of kilometres — and even across entire oceans — between feeding and nesting grounds. Regional cooperation is essential to ensure that turtles are protected at different stages in their life cycles. 



Marine turtles have also been fundamental to the culture of coastal societies for millennia. 



“Human activities over the past 200 years have massively tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners,” says Elisabeth McLellan, WWF Asia Pacific Marine Turtle Coordinator. “Slaughtered in the thousands for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, they suffer from poaching and over-exploitation, as well as from capture in fishing gear and habitat loss. But there are places where concerted conservation efforts are making a difference to turtle numbers. We hope that this initiative galvanises countries to act together before it’s too late.” 



Countries involved are Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Comores. Eritrea. Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Kingdom, United Rep. of Tanzania, United States of America and Viet Nam.
