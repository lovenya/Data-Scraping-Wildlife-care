New Delhi: On 22nd September 2016, WWF-India celebrated with much gusto one of India’s  unique species – the greater one horned rhino – across all rhino bearing habitats in the country on the occasion of World Rhino Day.

The celebrations aimed at creating awareness among the masses on the uniqueness of the species; and its importance. WWF-India teams in Assam and Uttar Pradesh organized various awareness generating events in close collaboration with the local Forest Departments and the community. Special focus was also laid on reaching out to the local media fraternity in garnering support and spreading the conservation message.

In Assam, the day was celebrated across three locations of the Kaziranga National Park, Manas National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. About 1300 school students along with 100 local community members attended these events organized by WWF-India. As a part of all the three programs, the team organized essay-writing, open quiz, poster making competition, and drawing competition among the students. In Kaziranga NP, the program was organized in collaboration with the Kaliabor Press Club and the Forest Department. In Pobitora WLS, the program was organized with the Pobitora Eco Tourism and Development Society; and in Manas NP the team joined hands with Manas Ever Welfare Society (MEWS) in Bansbari range. A documentary film on rhino conservation was also screened. Speaking on the occasion, in Pobitora WLS, Mr. Tarani Kanta Singh, traditional King of Mayong kingdom, appealed to the people for securing the rhinos.



In Uttar Pradesh, the team celebrated the World Rhino Day in collaboration with the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. The event was attended by forest officials, front line staffs, local community members and children. The children were enthused to meet and interact with the front line patrolling staff specially the mahouts. A rhino documentary was also screened during the occasion.



Despite a steady increase in the population of rhinos, poaching, habitat loss, and other risks like disease, in-breeding, and mass mortality remain some of the important threats to their survival. To support rhino conservation in the country, WWF-India works in close coordination with the state governments, the media fraternity and local communities. In Assam, WWF-India is also implementing the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 Program, along with other partners, to manage and secure the rhino bearing habitats, and conduct range expansion to establish new rhino population.



The World Rhino Day was launched by WWF-South Africa on September 22 in the year 2010. The day is internationally observed across both African and Asian rhino bearing countries.
