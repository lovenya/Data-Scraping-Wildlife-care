Leading Indian companies are demonstrating global best practices in disclosing their carbon emissions and setting performance targets for mitigation of GHG emissions. 
51 Indian companies have responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) this year. In the disclosure, companies reported on their carbon emissions data, emissions reduction targets, associated risks and opportunities and increasingly board level and managerial resources are spearheading the execution of climate change strategies within their organisations. 
The most significant change from last years’ is that the responses have been improving both in terms of content and comprehensiveness.

Mumbai: Just weeks before the crucial UN climate talks in Cancun, close to 100 senior leaders from Indian business and industry came together to release the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Report 2010 - India 200. This is the fourth edition of the CDP India report since it was first published in 2007 and is based on the top 200 companies in India based on market capitalisation.



The CDP report substantiates the significance of climate change to India’s corporate boardrooms from a policy framework, changing climate and business opportunity perspective. The report brings out the challenges Indian companies are facing and outlines how they are integrating the long term value and costs of climate change impacts into their assessment of the financial health and future prospects for their business. The disclosures are based on their commitments towards the environment and averting climate change. The process was carried out by the CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development and WWF-India in partnership with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The project is supported by the British High Commission, New Delhi. 

  

The foreword to the Report was provided by Shri Jairam Ramesh, India’s Minister of State for Environment & Forests [Independent incharge]. He applauded CII, WWF and CDP in enabling this initiative, and its importance in supplementing the efforts of the Government of India in meeting the new-age challenge of climate change. 

  

The report was released by Mr. Suresh Shetty, Minister for Public Health & Family Welfare, Environment, Protocol, and Additional Charge of Sports & Youth Welfare, Government of Maharashtra. Praising the voluntary disclosure by business, the Minister stressed the importance of voluntary measures in mitigating and adapting to climate change, and sought greater industry participation. The event was attended by heads and representatives from leading businesses in the country. 

  

Mr. Jamshyd Godrej, Chairman of CII’s National Council on Climate Change, said “This year’s report saw a marked improvement in the quality of the disclosure. Also, there is a requirement of a higher level of understanding of the subject and implications for all businesses. Such disclosures are expected to become mandatory in the near future, and CII has started several initiatives to address this challenge.”. 

  

Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, “CDP provides a global mechanism for Indian companies to voluntarily disclose their actions to address climate change. WWF is very pleased with the marked improvement in the quality of responses we have received this year. It shows the level of ambition and transparency that Indian business is demonstrating towards addressing climate change.” 

  

Mr. Peter Beckingham Deputy British High Commissioner to India, “The British government already had made firm commitments to reduce the GHG emissions; 30% cut by 2020, and 80% lower by 2050. The initiative such as the CDP would help to demonstrate the seriousness of such commitment. There is a great window of opportunity for Indian and British business to collaborate in this regard.” 

  

Mr. Paul Simpson, Chief Executive Officer, CDP said “We are encouraged by the continued improvement in quality of the response by leading Indian companies who demonstrate best practice on par with their global peers. We look forward to deepening engagement on the solutions to climate change with Indian financial institutions and companies in the coming years.” 

  

The results of the fourth CDP India Report 2010 continue to build on the positive findings from 2009. ACC, Ackruty City, Financial Technologies, Gillette India, IndusInd Bank, Procter & Gamble Company, Tech Mahindra and Titan Industries are some of the additional companies that came on board this year. 

  

In CDP 2010, the information request was backed by 534 institutional investors, with more than US$ 64 trillion assets under management (more than half the worlds invested capital). Indian institutional investors such as HDFC Bank Ltd, IDBI, IDFC, Reliance Capital and Yes Bank Ltd. were part of these 534 global institutional investors. 



Key findings of the analysis: 

Compared to 62% in CDP 2009, 85% of the responding companies disclosed their GHG emissions. 
With growing levels of participation, the total GHG emissions reported to CDP 2010 is 114 million tonnes, compared to the 68.9 million tonnes (in CDP 2009) and 36.3 million metric tonnes in CDP 2008. 
Nearly 97% of the respondents identify opportunities arising from climate change, in comparison to 80% identifying risks, as a result of regulatory, physical or commercial drivers. 
CDP 2010 finds that a very high percentage of Indian responding companies are taking action to reduce GHG emissions and this trend is comparable with the best in the world. 
Although in total only 10 companies disclose monetary savings as a result of their actions, the reported amount stands at a staggering Rs. 3,933 million (ca. US$85 million) and of the achieved emissions reductions come to 6.2 million metric tonnes of CO2-e per year. 
In keeping with these trends and with an intention to further encourage and reward high quality responses, this year sees CDP India introduced the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) in India. The CDLI is based on a disclosure score and ranks the organisations in terms of the quality and completeness of their disclosure. Companies in the Indian CDLI are: Wipro, Jubilant Organosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Chemicals, Tata Steel, Larsen and Toubro, ACC, Mahindra and Mahindra, Ambuja Cements and Sesa Goa. 

The fourth CDP report has clearly brought out that while all responding companies acknowledge that climate change has become an imperative, some of them have acknowledged this as an opportunity and are taking initiatives that will encourage many more companies to follow examples of good practices in disclosing emission and formulating reduction plans. Companies who have not responded this year will be asked by more of their investors than ever to respond next year. India inc. leaders emerge: building a low carbon economy
