New Delhi, 3rd March 2023: Delhi is the second most bird-rich capital city in the world.  Home to a staggering diversity of resident bird species, the bustling metropolis also welcomes winter and summer visitors and passage migrants who stop by on their incredible journeys. What’s more? Sanjay Van, a reserve forest in the heart of Delhi, supports 200+ species of birds.

 

WWF-India has curated the Sanjay Van Bird Festival as a series of events, experiences and an exhibition for the people of Delhi to experience and celebrate birds in our city. This is an extended commemoration of World Wildlife Day (3rd March 2023)

 

Mr. Peush Kumar, Deputy Director (Landscapes), DDA, said: "The strategic partnership between DDA and WWF India has gone a long way in imparting nature-based education amongst citizens and inculcating an understanding of the environment. DDA hopes that the number of initiatives being undertaken shall continue to bear fruit. We are committed to nurturing this relationship and facilitating connections between humans and nature. We have a lot to learn from birds - patience, resilience, resourcefulness, teamwork, perseverance, adaptability, vigilance and creativity. The Sanjay Van Bird Festival is an endeavour to 'Work with Nature, rather than against it…'. We successfully held a Moth Festival, Dragonfly Festival, as well as numerous nature trails on flora & fauna with experts in the Sanjay Van Forest.”

 

The event will be attended by officials from the DDA, WWF-India and people in Delhi at large.
