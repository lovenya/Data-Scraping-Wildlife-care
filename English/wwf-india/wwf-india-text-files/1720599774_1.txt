For years rhinos have been widely slaughtered for their horn – making poaching one of the primary reasons why there are only around 2500 rhinos left in India and Nepal. Despite attempts to keep poaching under check, rhino killing is on the rise. 21 rhinos were reportedly poached in the year 2012 and till end May this year an alarming 14 rhinos have been killed. 



One such poaching incident resulted in the killing of a female rhino on 2 April 2013 in Manas National Park Assam. The rhino had recently given birth and her calf had been spotted by the WWF-India officials just a few days earlier. To save the calf, a complex search and rescue operation was mounted, involving staff of the Assam Forest Department, veterinarians, local villagers and members of WWF-India’s rhino monitoring team. The calf was successfully rescued and brought to the elephant training centre in the Bansbari range of the Park where it is now being raised with the help of rescue and rehabilitation experts. 



WWF-India remains committed to conservation of rhinos through the IRV 2020 programme and will work with the Assam Forest Department and other stakeholders to ensure that the remaining rhinos in Manas are better protected.



IRV 2020 

WWF-India initiated the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) in partnership with the Assam Forest Department and other organizations in 2005 with the aim of increasing the total rhino population in Assam to about 3000 by the year 2020, by ensuring distribution of rhinos over at least seven protected areas. So far, a total of 18 rhinos have been translocated from the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and the Kaziranga National Park to the Manas National Park.
