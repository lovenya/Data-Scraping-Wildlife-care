With record numbers in attendance, the conservation and management priorities for wild plants and animals took centre stage at the 65th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), from 7 to 11 July, in Geneva. These are some outcomes that are relevant to India:



Pangolins - Outcome SC65: The severity of the growing trends in illegal pangolin trade to Asian consumer markets within Asia, and increasingly from Africa, was a key issue at this meeting. At SC65, an inter-sessional working group was established, which will pay serious attention to the threat posed to pangolins over the coming year. 



Tigers and other ABCs : Tigers and other Asian big cats (Leopard, Snow Leopard, Clouded Leopard and Asiatic Lion) - Outcome SC65: Data presented to the Standing Committee showed a significant increase in the illegal trade of Asian big cats, in particular Tigers. As with other species affected by illegal trade in wildlife, Asian big cat crimes cannot be addressed by one authority or one country alone. Strong cooperation with a multi-disciplinary approach amongst range, transit, and destination countries is vital. Multiple decisions were taken including on taking targeted demand reduction strategies and the implementation of measures to effectively regulate the activities of captive breeding facilities. The Committee further requested China, India, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand and Viet Nam to take specific actions to address illegal trade in these species. 



The CITES Standing Committee meeting also took cognizance of the fact that Indian wildlife laws do not provide adequate protection for non native species protected under CITES.
