New Delhi: WWF awarded the two winners of its short film competition “Life. Nature. You. Make the Connection.” launched in the context of WWF’s 50th anniversary celebrations, at the prestigious CMS VATAVARAN Film Festival today. 



The award ceremony witnessed participation from independent filmmakers, students, film commissioners, nature TV channel executives and film enthusiasts. The presentation of awards was followed by the screening of the winning entries and a panel discussion that broadly dealt with the topic "'Environmental Filmmaking - Challenges of Funding and Audience Building". 



The distinguished guests on the panel included Mr. Ralf Quibeldey , Commissioning Editor - Wildlife & Nature, Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Germnany; Mr. Evert van den Bos, General Manager, Nature Conservation Films; Mr. Adam Schmedes, Managing Director of Loke Film; Mr. Dennis Aig, Program Director - MFA Science & Natural History Filmmaking, Montana State University, Bozeman, USA; Mr. Keertan Adyanthaya, Managing Director, National Geographic Network and Fox International Channels; Mr. Chris Miller, Regional Coordinator, South Asia, TV/E and Ms. P. N. Vasanti, Director, CMS. 



The panellists offered their respective perspectives on what are the challenges one faces while looking for funding, marketing their film to the right audience and also reaching out to the largest possible audience using both traditional and new media. Besides the panel discussion, the event provided an opportunity to network with around 270 invitees and delegates from the film festival.



The film competition was aimed at emerging talent, asking filmmakers to produce original films, up to a maximum of 2 minutes, on the theme “Life. Nature. You. Make the Connection”. WWF was looking for films that would inspire people to value and protect their natural environment. 



The winner of the jury’s prize- “The Runner” is a film by Neil Losin and Nathan Dappen that focuses on breaking down the distinction between the man-made world and the natural one. The other winner, chosen by popular vote -“Life. Nature. You ” is a film by Myles Thompson. This film encourages people to connect with nature, starting with places or things which are close by, in this case, a small patch of grass in a back yard.

“Inspirational filmmakers have helped us to celebrate WWF’s anniversary in style producing innovative and moving short films that put people in touch with the environment,” said Sudanshu Sarronwala, Executive Director of Communications and Marketing at WWF International.



The two winners will be commissioned to create short films for WWF in 2012 for a minimum budget of 10,000 USD.
