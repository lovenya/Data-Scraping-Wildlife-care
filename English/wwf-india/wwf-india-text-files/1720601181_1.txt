WWF India is hosting a webinar on Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs) for Corporate RE Procurement on Dec 21, 2021 at 2:30-3:30 PM IST. Globally, VPPA has emerged as a popular tool for corporates to enhance their renewable electricity uptake. Large corporate groups like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, to name a few have successfully used this model to meet their renewable electricity targets internationally. The webinar aims to deliberate on the opportunities available for the effective implementation of VPPAs in the Indian RE market and discuss the challenges that could hinder its uptake in the current scenario.



Mr Rajesh Kumar Mediratta, Director, IEX and Mr Rahula Kashyapa, Head of Business Development, Renew Power will speak during the webinar.
