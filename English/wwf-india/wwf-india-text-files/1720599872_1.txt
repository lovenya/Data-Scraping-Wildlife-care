On 20 December 2013, the 68th session of the United Nations General Assembly decided to proclaim 3rd March, the day of the adoption of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as World Wildlife Day, to celebrate and raise awareness of the world’s wild fauna and flora. Welcoming the news, CITES Secretary-General, Mr John E. Scanlon, said, “World Wildlife Day is an ideal opportunity to celebrate the many beautiful and varied forms of wild fauna and flora and raise awareness of the multitude of benefits that conservation provides to people.



At the same time, the Day reminds us of the urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime, which has wide-ranging economic, environmental and social impacts. We invite all member States, relevant organizations of the United Nations system as well as all other interested organizations and individuals -- from airports to museums to schools -- to get involved in this global celebration of wildlife." The CITES Secretariat has also created a dedicated World Wildlife Day Facebook page to share news and stories of the Day, which can be followed at https://www.facebook.com/WorldWildlifeDay
