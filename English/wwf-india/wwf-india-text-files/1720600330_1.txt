LACHEN, SIKKIM: Adopting an innovative approach to spread the ‘waste-free environment’ message, Lachen, a tourist destination in North Sikkim district, brought in the Tibetan New Year this year with a zero-waste event. Losar, an annual festival celebrated in several parts of the Himalayas to bring in the New Year, was organized in Lachen by the Lachen Dzumsa and Lachen Tourism Development Committee from 12-14 January 2016, with support from WWF-India and other non-profit organizations.



Declared a zero-waste event, the Lachen Losar festival this year banned disposable materials, and encouraged the use of reusable materials. To promote sustainable living and showcase traditional cuisine, locally-made snacks were also promoted over fast food. Local handicrafts were on display. Several women’s self-help groups also showcased products made by them from re-usable waste materials.



An interactive exhibition set up by WWF-India during the festival, informed and promoted conservation of the unique local biodiversity of Sikkim. It displayed camera trap photographs of wildlife in North Sikkim – the outcome of a camera trapping exercise that WWF-India conducted as part of a wildlife survey in the North Sikkim Plateau in collaboration with the Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department of the Government of Sikkim. Photographs of snow leopards in North Sikkim district, as well as pictures of other wild ungulates were appreciated by the locals. Awareness was also provided to the community on following zero-waste principles.

The two-day event was visited by many enthusiasts including community members from Lachen, Chaten and Thangu villages, Army personnel and tourists.



The Hon'ble Minister for Forests, Govt. of Sikkim Mr. T.W. Lepcha who paid a visit, encouraged the ‘waste-free’ message and said that such efforts will go a long way in promoting sustainable tourism and making Lachen a highly acclaimed tourism destination in Sikkim.
