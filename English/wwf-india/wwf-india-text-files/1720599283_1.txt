In the face of Climate Change, there is an urgent need for the Himalayan nations to build resilience to buffer the impacts of Climate Change and generate resources for adaptation, capacity building, and technology transfer. In the Himalayas where the impacts of Climate Change are manifesting at a rapid pace, the time for action is running out. Recognizing this, the Governments of Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh and India have agreed to come together to participate in the Climate Summit of a Living Himalayas which is being hosted in Bhutan, the land of the Thunder Dragon on 19 November 2011. 



The summit is a high level meeting that aims for a joint declaration on conservation of ecosystem services between India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. While the process is independent of the UNFCCC, the Summit offers an interesting opportunity to communicate the impacts of Climate Change in the region.

Climate Summit for a Living Himalayas Bhutan 2011 brings together the efforts of the Royal Government of Bhutan along with support from WWF and other partners with the aim of arriving at a framework of regional cooperation to help protect the region’s biodiversity and ecosystem services.



Broadly speaking, Nepal, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are holding the summit to work out a regional agreement that will help support adaptation to the impacts of global Climate Change in the Himalayas. The four nations hope to accomplish this by addressing four themes: securing the biodiversity and ensuring its sustainable use; ensuring food security and securing livelihoods; securing the natural freshwater systems of the Himalayas; and ensuring energy security and enhancing alternative technologies. 



WWF staff participated in the inauguration ceremony held on 14 November morning at the newly made Youth Complex in Thimphu. The main guest of the day was the youngest Princess of Bhutan accompanied by high government officials that included Dasho Paljor Dorji- Advisor, National Environment Commission, Bhutan.



WWF’s main event will be held on the 17 November and will focus on two main issues- snow leopard conservation and Climate Change and vulnerability of people and ecosystems to changing climate in the Himalayas. 



WWF-India has been working in the Eastern Himalayas to preserve the biodiversity of the area, conserve the High-Altitude Wetlands, and endangered species like the Snow leopard and Red panda, apart from species like tiger, rhinos and elephants.
