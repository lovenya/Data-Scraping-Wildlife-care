The London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade that took place from 12-13 February, 2014, was an opportunity for governments to commit to finally ending the illegal trade in elephants, rhinos, tigers and other endangered wildlife species whose very survival is in crisis due to rampant poaching for illegal trade.



The event was hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Heads of State, Ministers and high level representatives of 46 countries, including those most heavily impacted by poaching and illegal trade of wildlife, have committed to taking “decisive and urgent action” to tackle the global illegal wildlife trade.The strongly worded declaration was issued following two days of closed-door negotiations hosted in London by the UK government. Their Royal Highnesses, Princes Charles, William and Harry also participated in the event.



WWF and TRAFFIC welcomed the post-conference “London Declaration” for recognizing the significant scale and detrimental economic, social and environmental consequences of illegal wildlife trade. "The benefits of working together in a constructive and pragmatic manner were evident earlier this week with the release of the results of Operation Cobra II, a highly successful collaborative operation between 28 States in Asia, Africa and North America" said CITES Secretary General, Scanlon.
