The World Wetland Day celebrated each year on 2nd February, marks the anniversary of the signing of the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention) in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971. The first wetland day was celebrated in 1997. Since then government agencies, non-government organisations and community groups have celebrated World Wetlands Day by undertaking actions to raise public awareness of wetland values and benefits and promote the conservation and wise use of wetlands.



The theme for this year was “Wetlands and Tourism”, and in keeping with this theme the Tsomgo Pokhri Sanrakshan Samiti in collaboration with WWF-India, Khangchendzonga Landscape Programme celebrated the event in Tsomgo with an aim to sensitise the tourists. An exhibition of posters related to Tsomgo lake and its biodiversity and cultural values, threats and conservation measures was put on display for the tourists. Along with this, members of Pokhri Sanrakshan Samiti also explained through posters all the activities that PSS had conducted over the years, and explained to the tourists how the Rs.10 that they had contributed as conservation fee was being utilised. 



A “Wetlands Tour Quiz” that took tourists on a tour of the various wetlands in the state, while being quizzed about Sikkim and its environment was the highlight of the day. This gave participants a chance to know about the other wetlands of the state and understand their importance. Gifts of posters, book marks, postcards, stickers, badges, caps and t-shirts ensured tourists interest in the activities and at the same time learning about environment. 



The programme was also supported by Officials from Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management and Police Department and the local communities.
