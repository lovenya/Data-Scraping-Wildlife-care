New Delhi: WWF-India participated yesterday upon a special invitation at the 74th Annual Session of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) currently underway in the city of Guwahati, Assam. Dr. A. Christy Williams, Coordinator, WWF AREAS programme presented on the mitigation measures that could be undertaken during construction of linear infrastructure to minimize their negative impact on the local flora and fauna. The members of the IRC received the presentation and the proposed mitigation measures very positively and WWF was also invited to become part of the IRC to help mainstream such mitigation measures for linear infrastructure projects across India.
 
This is the first time that WWF-India was given a chance to present at the IRC and it was possible through the generous support extended by the Assam Public Works Department. The Nature Conservation Foundation-India provided additional support and inputs for the presentation.
 
Given the developmental pressures facing India’s forests, this has the potential to be a watershed moment for WWF-India’s efforts to get mitigation measures for linear infrastructure mainstreamed. The IRC produces technical manuals that are used by all government agencies in India. These range from numbering milestones to building culverts, flyovers and bridges. The IRC is also the main technical advisory agency for the Ministry of Roads and Transport, Government of India. 
 
“The IRC is the premier technical body on roads in India. Through our presentation here and through further collaboration we hope IRC, WWF and other stakeholders can put in place guidelines for mitigation measures for linear infrastructure projects across India that will be incorporated into every project in future.” said Dr. Christy Williams. 


WWF-India will initiate steps to work with the IRC to come up with a technical manual on structures such as underpasses, overpasses, and canopy bridges to mitigate the impact of linear infrastructure on wildlife. The release of such a document would ensure that such mitigation measures and budgets for the same would be integrated at the project planning stage itself for all linear infrastructure projects across India. 



For future IRC sessions, WWF-India will stress on preparation of actual designs and technical specifications of mitigation measures and also push for laying down guiding principles on how and when a road is needed through a forest area.
