New Delhi: The Delhi Ridge, forming the northern extension of the Aravalli Range, stretches 35 kms from Tughlaqabad near the Bhatti mines to Wazirabad on the west bank of Yamuna. The smallest part of the Ridge, called the Northern Ridge, is a flourishing Reserve Forest in the Delhi University area, rich in floral and faunal biodiversity. 



In an effort to maintain the biodiversity supported by this forest, members of the NSS of Delhi University have initiated a week long clean-up drive of this area under WWF-India’s Cities For Forests campaign. Kick starting this project on 20th October, more than 100 students from various colleges gathered early morning opposite St. Stephens College to participate in a nature walk around the Northern Ridge organized by WWF-India. The students were led by Dr. Surya Prakash, Professor at JNU and a familiar name amongst Delhi’s birding groups, AVM Vinod Rawat, an expert in floral biodiversity, and Dr. Oswal who has been associated with the Delhi Ridge for many years. 



Through this walk, students were introduced to the natural world around them, and sensitized about the importance of this forest and its role in supporting the city. Covering the entire Ridge in the one hour walk, they observed different species of birds, trees, plants, insects, reptiles and mammals supported by this forest. Ms. Mita N. Goswami, Director, Environment Education, WWF-India, said, “The Northern Ridge forms the green lungs of our city, and harbours rich biodiversity. It is a perfect example of a forest thriving within a bustling city. We need to inculcate a sense of responsibility amongst the youth towards protecting such urban forests which play an important role in maintaining our city’s ecological balance. Nature walks like these help to create a connect with the environment in the minds of students.” During the walk, students recorded their observations which they will later share through stories, pictures and videos on the campaign website www.citiesforforests.in. 



The clean-up drive will start from tomorrow, where groups of students from different colleges will divide the area amongst them and strive to remove all non-biodegradable waste during the course of seven days.
