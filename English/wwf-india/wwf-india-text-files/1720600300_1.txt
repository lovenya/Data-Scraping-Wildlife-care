New Delhi: A truly sustainable solution can only be provided when the ecosystem factors are spoken about in the same breath as the actual implementation of solutions, says a WWF-India & SELCO Foundation report, released today.

 

The study, Deployment of Renewable Energy Solutions for Energy Access: An Ecosystem Approach, provides a broad ecosystem based approach for providing clean energy access and promoting productive uses of energy solutions that enhance livelihood opportunities using renewable energy solutions. It formulates an inclusive renewable energy implementation model that takes into account the complete business ecosystem, i.e., technology, finance (capital and end user), capacity building, institutional framework, policies and livelihood aspects of renewable energy application(s).

 

This study combines literature reviews and the experiences of energy enterprises and other organizations presently engaged in addressing developmental challenges, to develop a framework that provides an understanding of the challenges and opportunities. The framework was applied to two districts each in Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, to validate its applicability. The final framework document incorporates inputs from field research and other stakeholders to provide a structure and a process that can detail the energy scenario and the readiness for energy access solution deployment.

 

Dr Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF-India, said, “One of the main challenges in scaling up energy access solutions and reaching out to larger populace is the lack of a strong foundation of the various factors – or the ecosystem – that enables the long-term functioning and sustainability of solutions. The study would help organizations to design large-scale decentralized renewable energy solutions key rural and ecological landscapes.”

 

On the release of the report, Mr Harish Hande, CEO, SELCO Foundation, remarked, “This report comes at a timely moment after COP 21 and displays our commitment as a country to creating energy access solutions that simultaneously address developmental and environmental challenges. The interventions proposed can be replicated not only in India but also in other parts of the developing world.” 

 

The unique part of the proposed framework is its ability to easily identify gaps and opportunities in the energy access ecosystem. Convergence of subsidies and incentives across schemes, combined with the introduction of energy as a metric of impact within the existing tribal, forest and rural development programmes, can go a long way in building the ideal structure for energy access. Most importantly, the study would help various organizations, including industries that have CSR obligation, to design interventions which promote large-scale replication of renewable energy applications in rural and remote areas through an innovative roadmap and business plan.

 

About SELCO Foundation:

Set up in 2010, SELCO Foundation engages in field-based research and development of holistic solutions and ecosystem building for the deployment of clean energy solutions that alleviate poverty amongst tribal, rural and urban poor communities. The Foundation works closely with practitioners in the social sector, energy entrepreneurs and partners from various developmental sectors, to develop holistic models (combining technology, finance and community aspects) that are based on field conditions and the needs of end users and grassroots entrepreneurs.
