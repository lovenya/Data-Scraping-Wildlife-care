Guwahati: WWF-India and Assam state Forest Department presented two ‘WWF-Assam Forest Department Vanya Prani Mitra Awards’ to twelve forest staff of the Assam state Forest Department for their exemplary service towards the protection of Assam’s wildlife at a special event organized today at the Guwahati Zoo in Assam, India. The awards were presented by the Honourable Minister of Forest and Environment, Government of Assam, Mr. Rakibul Hussain. One award in the individual category carried a citation and a cash award of Rs.25,000 whereas the group award carried a citation and a cash award of Rs.5,000/- to each of the 11 members of the group. 



Mr. Monomohan Das, Forester I was awarded the individual prize for significant contribution towards the rescue of a wild elephant stranded at Pancharatna Reserve Forest in the Goalpara Division. Showing resourcefulness and courage, he developed an acquaintance with the wild elephant within a day which helped in the successful rescue. He also attended to other wildlife emergencies and crises without hesitation and went out of his way to raise awareness among local communities for conservation of wildlife. 



A team of 11 frontline staff from the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park was given the team award for showing great courage under fire by bravely engaging with armed poachers while on a patrol in the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park. In the resultant encounter, a .303 rifle, an axe and four bags were recovered from the location and the poaching incident was averted.



Speaking on the occasion, the Honourable Minister said, “These awards will create a positive atmosphere for wildlife conservation in Assam and boost the morale of our frontline forest staff. In spite of the many difficult challenges facing them, the forest staff is doing a great job and this is reflected in the praise our conservation work is getting from around the world.”



“I thank the Assam Forest Department for joining WWF-India in this initiative to recognize the dedicated work of the frontline staff through these awards”, added Mr. Ravi Singh, CEO and Secretary General, WWF-India. Mr. V. K. Vishnoi, IFS, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) and Head of Forests, Assam and Mr. Suresh Chand, IFS and PCCF, Wildlife Assam and Chief Wildlife Warden, Assam were also present at the event. 



“I’ve been working for wildlife conservation for the past decade and I’m really happy that I’ve been selected for this award. Forests will exist only if the wildlife within them is protected and I hope to continue to do my bit to ensure this”, said Mr. Monomohan Das, Forester I, Goalpara Division. 



“It is difficult working for wildlife conservation in the field. With the help of my team’s efforts we have ensured zero poaching in Orang in the last one year by thwarting a number of attempts made by poachers. My whole team is thankful for this award and for the help WWF-India provided in the field”, added Mr. Chakrapani Roy, Forest Ranger, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park on behalf of his team.



These awards constituted jointly by WWF-India and Assam Forest Department continue the long standing partnership between the two in working for the conservation of Assam’s rich wildlife, especially under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) program. Under this program, previously 18 rhinos have been successfully translocated from Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and Kaziranga National Park to Manas National Park, where they are monitored regularly. In addition, WWF-India is also collaborating with the Assam Forest Department for managing human – elephant conflict and tiger conservation including monitoring tigers, co-predators and prey in different Protected Areas and Forest Divisions of the state.

About Vanya Prani Mitra Awards

The ‘WWF-Assam Forest Department Vanya Prani Mitra Awards’ were jointly constituted by WWF-India and Assam Forest Department in 2011 to recognise outstanding contribution to wildlife conservation in Assam by the frontline staff of Assam Forest Department or an individual, group or agency outside the Forest Department who made a significant contribution towards conservation of wildlife in the previous 12 months. Two awards are presented annually and carry a cash prize of Rs. 25,000 each and a citation. 



About IRV 2020

The IRV 2020 is a joint programme of the Department of Environment and Forests – Government of Assam, WWF-India and the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) with support from the Bodoland Territorial Council, US Fish and Wildlife Service and the local communities. 



The programme’s vision is to increase Assam’s rhino population to 3000 by 2020, which will be done by wild-to-wild translocation from Kaziranga National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary to Manas and Dibru Saikhowa National Parks as well as Laokhowa and Burachopari Wildlife Sanctuaries. Assam accounts for the largest population of Indian rhinoceros. Though rhino numbers in the state have grown from 2000 in 2005 to over 2500 in 2012, more than 90% of these live in just one Protected Area, which is the Kaziranga National Park. The IRV 2020 programme aims to secure the long term survival of wild rhinos in Assam by expanding their distribution to reduce risks like disease, in-breeding depression and mass mortality.
