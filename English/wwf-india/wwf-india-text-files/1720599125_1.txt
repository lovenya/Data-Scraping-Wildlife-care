Kathmandu, Nepal - The Green Hiker campaign was formally launched on May 29, 2011 by Honorable Khadga Bahadur Biswakarma, Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Government of Nepal at an event organised to commemorate the 4th International Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) Day at Nepal Tourism Board. The Green Hiker campaign is a WWF initiative to conserve the Himalayan high altitude wetlands, founded under its 'Saving Wetlands Sky-High! programme. It is already running successfully in India in the five Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 



In Nepal, Nepal Tourism Board, Government of Nepal, is a partner to this campaign. In addition, the year 2011 is the Year of Tourism in Nepal. 



Targeted primarily at tourists and tour operators, the campaign is an awareness drive to promote responsible tourism in the high altitude areas. Tourism is a strong revenue generator for Nepal and its communities, with Nepal's natural riches being the major attraction for tourists. To sustain tourism and tourist flows, protection of the natural habitat is an imperative, hence this campaign to encourage tourists to undertake environment- friendly actions and contribute to local economies while travelling through this fragile eco-region. Merchandising, interpersonal communications and events will be the major tools used in this campaign. 



Speaking at the event, Dr. Ghana Gurung, Conservation Program Director of WWF Nepal, opined that tourism gains cannot be at the cost of the environment. “We need to ensure that Nepal's natural heritage is passed on from generation to generation; collective effort of the government, development agencies and the private sector under the Green Hiker campaign is expected to contribute to this end,” he added. 



Representing WWF-India at the launch, Ragini Letitia Singh spoke about the origin of the campaign in India, how it was implemented and received and its achievements and future plans. She summed up with the clear message “Nature leaves a mark on you, don’t leave one behind.” Green Hiker launched in the land of the Everest!
