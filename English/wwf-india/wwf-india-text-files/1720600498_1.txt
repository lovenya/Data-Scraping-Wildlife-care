Bengaluru: WWF-India, in partnership with CII, organized a regional workshop on “Climate Solver+: Fostering Cleantech Innovation in SME sector in India” in Bengaluru on 15 March 2017. This is second among the series of regional workshops, reaching out to cleantech entrepreneurs working on sustainable energy solutions. The workshop included key representation from government, venture capitalists, incubation centres, SMEs, universities, financial institutions, industry associations and other stakeholders from the southern region.

 

WWF’s Climate Solver platform recognizes Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), whose innovative technologies significantly reduce carbon-dioxide emissions or provide improved energy access to rural or urban poor. Over the last four years, the India chapter of this platform has recognized 15 promising innovators and conferred the Climate Solver award to them. Some of these winning companies have also been listed in the top 100 innovators listed in Sustainia100 – an annual guide that identifies projects, initiatives and technologies that are at the forefront of sustainable innovation from around the world, based on a review of more than 1500 projects and businesses from six continents.

 

In its fifth year, WWF-India has expanded this platform to the “Climate Solver +” platform, and through this intends to strengthen the cleantech innovation ecosystem in the country by enhancing networking amongst SMEs and other relevant stakeholders such as the finance community, incubation centres/accelerators, and government bodies. SMEs in India, especially at grassroot/regional level, still encounter barriers that hold them back from scaling up. This initiative therefore seeks to address these barriers by building on the successes of the Climate Solver initiative in India to scale climate innovation among SMEs by growing the pool of clean energy innovators, providing a select group of innovators with business and financial planning, and building a community of clean energy innovation practice.

 

Mr Kamal Bali, Chairman, CII Kanataka State Council & MD, Volvo India remarked, “Opportunities are available both at the national and global to comeout with innovative technologies through local and national incubation centers, national and global research centers, and business platforms. Small and medium enterprises, being a major consumer of energy, have a lot of potential to use methods and technology that is not only energy efficient but also reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SMEs in India, especially at grassroot /regional level, still encounter barriers that prevent them from having the significant impact on energy access and carbon reductions. This project therefore seeks to address these barriers by building on the successes of the Climate Solver initiative in India to scale climate innovation among SMEs by growing the pool of clean energy innovators, providing a select group of innovators with business and financial planning, and building a community of clean energy innovation practice.”

 

Holistically analysing the clean technology innovation landscape in India, Dr T.S.Panwar, Director, Climate Change & Energy, WWF-India, emphasized on the need to reach out to different regions in order to have a deeper understanding of the ecosystem, and strengthen linkages of the SMEs with the various orchestrators in the innovation space.

 

Mr Sanjeev Sharma, Vice Chairman, CII Karnataka State Council said, “WWF, CII & Government have come together for Making Clean and Green energy products for sustainable future. Radical innovation is the key to reducing emissions over the medium and long term, but it will not stop climate change from getting worse in the meantime. This is where the realism comes in: many people will have to adapt to a hotter Earth, and some of them will need help.  Pragmatism should replace green theology. The climate is changing because of extraordinary inventions like the steam turbine and the internal combustion engine. The best way to cope is to keep inventing. Keep innovating new ways to produce energy. Perhaps, we could be inspired by Nature’s way of sustaining life. Coal now supplies 41% of the world’s electricity and 29% of the world’s energy—the bigger share than at any time in at least four decades. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is 40% higher than it was at the beginning of the industrial revolution. Public subsidy, of about $800bn since 2008, has distorted the market. It came about for noble reasons: to counter climate change and prime the pump for new, costly technologies, including wind turbines and solar panels. But subsidies hit just as electricity consumption in the rich world was stagnating because of growing energy efficiency and the financial crisis. The result was a glut of power-generating capacity that has slashed the revenues utilities earn from wholesale power markets and hence deterred investment.”
