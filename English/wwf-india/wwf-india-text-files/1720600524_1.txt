While in Sikkim, the day was observed with a screening of the film “Pokchi-The Red Panda” in East Sikkim. The screening was organised by the WWF India team for students of various schools located along the fringe of Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary in East Sikkim, 30 km from Gangtok. The short film that talks about the biodiversity of the region and the different habitats found in Sikkim was well received by all the students. The students were also informed on how a well-managed tourism sector can contribute significantly in reducing threats which could help in maintaining or increasing the key wildlife populations and biodiversity values through tourism revenue.

 

After the film, an open quiz was conducted for the students based on the information given on the film, and the winners were given away prizes like bookmarks, badges and Red Panda notebooks. The team traveled to 5 schools during the course of the event interacting with more than 400 students. This programme was organised in coordination with a women’s self help group from Pangthang in Sikkim.
