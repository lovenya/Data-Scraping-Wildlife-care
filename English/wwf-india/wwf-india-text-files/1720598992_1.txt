New Delhi: The Salim Ali Visitor Interpretation Centre, Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur, India, was conferred the Best Asian Wetland Centre Award 2010 on November 23rd, 2010 by Wetlands Links International (WLI) at its third international conference. The Centre inaugurated in 2006, at Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur has been established as a partnership between WWF-India, the Rajasthan Forest Department and D Swarovski & Co. The conference was held to bring together those working on wetland education and engagement across the globe. The network currently has over 100 members, and an active committee of leading wetland professionals. WLI encourages wetland centers to deliver the message on importance of wetlands, to bring about behavioral changes in the public and build capacity for Communication, Education, Participation and Awareness (CEPA) programs on wetland conservation. This year, the participants at the conference included representatives from several countries including China, Japan, Philippines, Hongkong, Iran, Iraq and Malaysia.



A team from WWF- India received the award from Mr. Chris Rostron, Head, WLI and Dr Maketab Mohammed, the President of Malaysia Nature Society during the Wetland Link International Symposium held in Malaysia from 22-25 November 2010. The aim of the award is to identify and reward best practice wetland centers in Asia. The criteria included the range of interpretation materials and displays, work engaging the local communities in the center’s activities, extent of events and activities aimed at broad cross-section of visitors, involvement in active conservation of species and habitats and the development of innovative approaches. As Mr. Rostron said, “Salim Ali Visitor Interpretation Centre has been awarded the award due to its great range of work, from education sessions with schools, to outreach work to local communities excluded from the park, and even working with local people working in the park itself.” Thus, the award was given in recognition of the role played by the Centre in conserving KNP and building awareness and stakeholdership amongst local communities and visitors for its preservation. 



 WWF-India’s work at Keoladeo National Park

WWF has been involved in core conservation work for the National Park since 1994. This includes working in partnership with the Forest Department to protect the wetland ecology and habitat that ensures that the Park is able to support the vibrant biodiversity. 

  

In 2006, the Salim Ali Visitor Interpretation Centre was established to reach out to a wide range of people and provide information on the wetland and its unique characteristics through exhibits, nature trails, trainings and other resource material. The Centre has been named after Dr Salim Ali, India's renowned ornithologist, who was in many ways a pioneer in his field in the country through his systematic and scientific documentation of Indian birds and who led the initial research and later, the development of the Keoladev National Park. Since its inception, the Rajasthan Forest Department has taken leadership in managing the Centre.  

  

However, in view of the increasing problems caused by repeated water shortages, due to lack of rain and a reducing monsoon and the resulting threats to the ecological integrity of the ecosystems, a project was designed to address this issue so as to ensure sufficient water availability for the Park. 

  

Thus began a long-term community engagement program called the Water for Life, in partnership with the Forest Department and D. Swarovski & Co. An essential component of this program is the Water School works with children in the villages situated around the Park on environment awareness, especially the wise-use of water resources. This program has engaged over 1800 children in the past 2 years and is supported by the Young Environment Leaders program, which hones the skills of those children that show a keen interest in environment conservation. Both programs together have yielded positive results and have seen children taking on activities on their own initiative.
