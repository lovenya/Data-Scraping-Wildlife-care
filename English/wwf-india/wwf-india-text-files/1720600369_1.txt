Madhya Pradesh: An exposure visit to prepare and guide the forest staff of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (TR) for an upcoming tiger translocation plan in the western segment of the reserve, was organized at the Panna TR, Madhya Pradesh, from 19-22 April 2016.

 

Organised by WWF-India in partnership with the Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh State Forest Departments, the four-day exposure visit trained a 12-member team comprising of the Assistant Conservator of Forest, Rangers, wildlife veterinarian, foresters and forest guards from different ranges of the Rajaji TR.

 

With its noteworthy success in tiger translocation (the first of which was in 2009), Panna TR was a creditable choice for translocation training and preparation. Panna TR has seen an exponential increase in tigers from 2009—the initial numbers of five females and two males have now increased to 35 tiger individuals. This number is derived after subtracting dispersed tigers, proving that Panna tigers are now a source population for neighbouring forests.

 

The field-based training was supervised by Mr. Bhagat (Range Officer) and Mr. Amar Singh (Deputy Ranger), both from the Hinotha Range of Panna TR. The four-day training started with a history of Panna TR and a chronological summary of each translocated tiger. Experiential learning was shared in describing challenges and successes associated with each translocated individual. This was complemented with thorough field training in use of radio collars, telemetry and data interpretation.

 

Amar Singh took the group to all ten ranges of Panna TR, plotting the movements of each radio-collared tiger (there are currently ten radio-collared tigers in the reserve). Emphasis was placed on exhaustive 24-hour surveillance of each tiger, choice of appropriate vehicles and equipment, and involvement of every single forest guard and watcher. Panna TR also involves members of the tribal Gond community in tracking collared tigers and driving vehicles, demonstrating partnership with the local community through livelihood engagement.

 

The Rajaji team learned about measures undertaken by Panna TR staff to avoid any human tiger conflict situations in neighbouring village hamlets. The reserve has been successful in avoiding human fatalities since the introduction of the first collared tiger. In addition to tiger monitoring, the team also learned about the protection regime of Panna TR and experienced examples of engagement of locals in tiger conservation.

 

The exposure visit encouraged the staff of Rajaji TR to prepare western Rajaji for tiger reintroduction, giving them a realistic presentation on the processes and challenges that they should anticipate. Many conditions are similar, like low tiger populations to start with, good populations of prey species, and comparable protection-related impediments; while divergent conditions are the  different terrain and forest type, presence of elephants and proximity of dense human habitation. This visit motivated the Rajaji TR staff to plan and prepare the site for tiger translocation, addressing the unique challenges and expending the learning from Panna TR. Asish Kumar, forest guard, Chilla Range, Rajaji TR, said, “The trip has encouraged the frontline staff of Rajaji TR to be part of tiger reintroduction programme and contribute in every little way possible.”

 

The visiting team appreciated the importance of site preparation, staff dedication, staff coordination and cooperation, staff motivation and morale boost, and efficient protection regime for tiger reintroduction and monitoring program.

 

In addition, this trip helped identify unforeseen challenges in Rajaji TR from the perception of tiger reintroduction, and motivated the staff to address these issues as part of site preparation and post release monitoring. The issues include: elephant country, low visibility, hilly terrain, dense human habitation, limited access to vantage points and limited road network.

 

Considering the importance of such exposure visit for knowledge exchange among tiger landscapes for better conservation implications, WWF-India plans to facilitate similar exposure and training programs for two more teams to Panna TR in the coming months; to ensure that every forester is prepared for the upcoming translocations.
