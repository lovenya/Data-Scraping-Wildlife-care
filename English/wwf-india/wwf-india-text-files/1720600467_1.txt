Darjeeling, West Bengal: The Zero Waste Himalaya group is a platform of organisations and individuals concerned with the increasing problem of waste across the fragile Himalayan landscapes.The group advocates for better waste management across the Himalayan region. In Sikkim - Darjeeling, the group is spearheaded by organisations and institutions like DLR Prerna, ECOSS, KCC, SIRD, RMDD and WWF-India.



The group works with local self-government institutions, community groups, educational institutions, and media in promoting zero waste practices. Continuing this effort, a cleanliness campaign was organised by WWF-India and the Zero Waste Himalaya on December 3 and 4, at Singalila National Park, which is one of the strongholds of red pandas in the Eastern Himalayas. The campaign was organised mainly to highlight the issue of waste accumulation in the park and get all stakeholders on board to come up with long term solutions for addressing the issue.



Singalila National Park located at an altitude of about 7000 ft in Darjeeling district is known for its trekking route to Sandakphu, the highest peak of West Bengal. Owing to this, littering by trekkers, tourists as well as hotels and eateries had led to a huge accumulation of polythene packets, plastic and glass bottles. About 100 Volunteers including participants from state Forest Department - Wildlife and Territorial Division, Society for Highlander Guides and Porters, North Point College, India-hikes, ATREE, Tourism Department, Dhotray Nature Guides’ Association, Real Rimbik Society, Landrovers’ Association, SSB and Sirikhola Social Organisation and Welfare Society joined hands to clean up the entire range.



Along the trail leading up to Sandapkhu, volunteers and residents picked up litter that had been discarded by trekkers, and cleaned dumping sites of the villages to recover recyclables. Interactions with the lodge owners, SSB personnel were also organised on their current practices and their suggestion for putting a waste management system in place were also taken. During the interaction, the lodge owners said that most hotels and establishments burn their plastic waste. They expressed their willingness to pay a certain amount for garbage pick-up service, if a system could be worked out.



Approximately two hundred large sacks of wastewere recovered from the entire area of the Singalila National Park. An alarming proportion of electronic waste consisting of CFL bulbs and tube lights, etc. was also found irresponsibly dumped in the National Park. The collected wastes were segregated into recyclables which was later handed over to the scrap dealers in Siliguri for recycling. The segregation exercise was carried to illustrate how most of the discarded items could actually be recycled or reused, and much of it also reduced by replacing with ecofriendly options. Moreover, if those waste materials were allowed to decay within the Park, it would have severely impacted the wildlife habitat and watershed services of the area.



The 2 day cleaning drive ended with a meeting of the participants at the Forest Interpretation Center in Sangalila National Park, where they stressed on the need to have a sustainable waste management system in place in the park. Participants shared their experiences about how the cleaning drive served as a motivation to reduce the volume of waste they were themselves generating. Some of the suggestions were to have garbage bags for every vehicle going up, organisation of awareness programmes for tourists, strict rules for tourists for proper waste disposal, invest in segregated bins for clusters and a garbage pick- up service which could bring down the waste from the park area on a routine basis. It was shared that plans for construction of a resource recovery at Maneybhanjyang by the Forest Department was already underway, which would be the first step towards achieving the status of zero waste in Singalila National Park. As a way forward, WWF-India will work with key stakeholders (SSB, Hoteliers, and shops, nature guides) in the park area to look at segregated collection points at various clusters within the park. The waste will be brought down at regular intervals and handed overto scrap dealers for recycling. Sensitisation programmes with taxi drivers, nature guides, and tourists will also be conducted as part of the programme.
