The 15 days old calf of Rhino 17 that was killed by poachers on 2nd April has been successfully rescued yesterday in Manas National Park in the Indian state of Assam. In a rescue operation involving thirty frontline and senior staff of Assam Forest Department, veterinarians, twenty local villagers and members of WWF-India’s rhino monitoring team divided into three elephant borne teams, the calf was caught about 3 km south of the area where its mother had been killed. It was then brought to the elephant training centre in the Bansbari range of the Park. The calf was administered oral rehydration and is currently under observation of the veterinarians. 



“It was a challenge getting hold of the calf as it was very scared but thankfully it is fine and doing well now”, said Mr. Deba Dutta, Senior Project Officer, WWF-India and one of the members of the rescue team.



Work will start shortly to construct a boma, a special fenced enclosure to which the calf will be transferred within a week. The rhino will be raised with the help of a rescue and rehabilitation expert from WTI.



While the rescue of the calf was undertaken successfully the larger challenge of ensuring the safety of the translocated rhinos in Manas remains. Rhino 17, the mother of the rescued calf, is the fourth translocated rhino to have been lost to poachers in Manas in the last two years and the 16th rhino killed in Assam so far this year. It was last seen alive on 28th March with its calf. Out of the 18 rhinos translocated to Manas National Park only 14 remain alive now. The rhinos had been translocated under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 programme (IRV 2020).



The high demand for rhino horn from East Asian countries through the illegal wildlife trade continues to pose the greatest threat for the rhinos of Assam. A multi-pronged strategy is needed to tackle the poaching menace. Apart from an inter-governmental approach, through CITES, to stem the rising illicit demand for rhino horn, which is wrongly believed to be a miracle cure in countries like Vietnam, the need of the hour is greater coordination between enforcement agencies and the Assam Forest Department in India to prevent poachers from targeting rhinos so easily.



“In Manas National Park itself, monitoring, patroling, intelligence and protection regimes need to be strengthened and implemented on ground in a time-bound, verifiable and accountable manner”, said Dr. Dipankar Ghose, Director, Species and Landscapes Programme, WWF-India.



WWF-India remains committed to conservation of rhinos through the IRV 2020 programme and will work with the Assam Forest Department and other stakeholders to ensure that the remaining rhinos in Manas are better protected.

About IRV 2020: 

The IRV 2020 is a joint programme of the Department of Environment and Forests – Government of Assam, WWF-India and the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) with support from the Bodoland Territorial Council, US Fish and Wildlife Service and the local communities. 



The programme’s vision is to increase Assam’s rhino population to 3000 by 2020, which will be done by wild-to-wild translocation from Kaziranga National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary to Manas and Dibru Saikhowa National Parks as well as Laokhowa and Burachopari Wildlife Sanctuaries. Assam accounts for the largest population of Indian rhinoceros. Though rhino numbers in the state have grown from 2000 in 2005 to over 2700 in 2011, more than 90% of these live in just one Protected Area, which is the Kaziranga National Park. The IRV 2020 programme aims to secure the long term survival of wild rhinos in Assam by expanding their distribution to reduce risks like disease, in-breeding depression and mass mortality.
