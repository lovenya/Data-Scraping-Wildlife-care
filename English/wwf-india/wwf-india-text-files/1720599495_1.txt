New Delhi: To help in strengthening the enforcement capabilities of India’s forest staff a new publication ‘Strengthening Enforcement: A Handbook for Forest Area Managers and Field Staff’ was released at the WWF-India Secretariat by Dr. Rajesh Gopal, IFS, Member Secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority today.



The handbook has been authored by Brig. Ranjit Talwar (Retd.) and published by WWF-India. Drawing on the rich experience of the author in enforcement matters while serving in the Indian Army, and in conservation and monitoring illegal wildlife trade while working with WWF-India and TRAFFIC-India the book is divided into five chapters that offer detailed insights on varied aspects such as planning security of Protected Areas, patrolling and surveillance, interpreting jungle signs, crime scene management and radio telephony. 



“This handbook will greatly help our frontline forest staff in imbibing essential knowledge and skills and thereby enhance their enforcement capacity.”,stated Dr. Rajesh Gopal after releasing the book. He also hoped that the book would be translated into Hindi and other vernacular languages so as to be accessible to forest staff across the country.



The handbook is meant to aid in improved training of forest field staff in anti poaching skills. The improved training should help in apprehending and bringing to justice a greater number of poachers thereby acting as a deterrant to others.



As Mr. P.K. Sen, IFS (Retd.), Former Director, Project Tiger in his opening message to the book mentions, “The publication covers good practices in investigation procedures, field craft and technical aspects like radio communications and fulfills a long felt need.” 



In the foreword, Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India adds, “The book addresses some vitally important aspects of anti-poaching training of the forest field staff and covers subjects that have not been formally addressed.” 



Writing in the preface, Brig. Talwar hopes that the book will help in strengthening the effectiveness of India’s forest staff in the field.

Notes to Editors



About Brig. Ranjit Talwar (Retd.)
