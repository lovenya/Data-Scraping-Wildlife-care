New Delhi: Two Indian SMEs with innovative cleantech solutions were awarded the winners of the sixth edition of WWF-India’s Climate Solver Awards held on 8th October 2018. Awarded by the Chief Guest, Sh. C. K. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Govt. of India, the two ventures – Carbon Masters India Pvt. Ltd. and Chakr Innovation Pvt. Ltd. have been conferred with the Climate Solver awards under the GHG Reduction category and have the potential to, together, substantially reduce GHG emissions, by 40 million tonnes by 2027, if implemented globally, whilst also addressing the critical environmental issues being faced in the country pertaining to air pollution and waste management. With this year’s edition, the number of Indian entrepreneurs on the Climate Solver Platform stands at 19 among the 107 honoured so far globally.

 
Climate Solver - WWF’s global innovation platform, recognizes transformative innovations in technology and business models that substantially contribute towards mitigating climate change and enhancing clean energy access. Climate Solver platform also complements the Mission Innovation (MI) efforts by the Government of India to accelerate the pace of innovation in the country and make clean energy reliable and affordable.

 
Carbon Masters India Private Limited was recognized for its innovative take on managing organic waste by collecting and converting the waste into clean fuel. Carbon Masters collects the waste generated in their bio-CNG trucks from various bulk waste generating establishments, and treats the waste anaerobically to produce methane gas and organic slurry. The gas is compressed and bottled to form Carbonlites which is used as a substitute to LPG for cooking and as fuel in vehicles, while the slurry is treated to produce organic manure which is used as a replacement to chemical fertilizers. Right from collection of segregated waste till the production of Carbonlites and organic manure, Carbon Masters ensures that it collects the organic waste using bio-CNG trucks and manages it to produce clean fuel through a 360-degree waste management approach.

 
Chakr Innovation was awarded for its technology- Chakr Shield which is a retrofit solution that captures up to 90% Particulate Matter (PM) from Diesel Generator(DG) thereby reducing the black carbon emissions to the atmosphere and improving the quality of air. The device is installed over the exhaust pipe of the DG that captures the exhaust and cools it to cause agglomeration of the soot particles. These soot particles, which primarily consist of PM, are collected as raw material for making inks and paints for use in merchandise.

 
The award event was followed by the launch of the Climate Solver Hub - a virtual interactive platform to bring together the key stakeholders of the clean energy ecosystem- innovators, corporates and the investors. The hub is an exclusive platform for the Climate Solver innovators in India with an objective to strengthen the climate innovation entrepreneurial ecosystem. The Hub aims to create a platform for innovators to showcase their technology, and network with potential investors, as well as for investors and corporates to discover, finance and adopt innovations by SMEs in the clean energy space.

 
Speaking at the event, Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India, said, “The Climate Solver platform showcases innovative climate solutions emerging from the SME sector from across different regions of the country. While these solutions have potential to reduce global GHG emissions, they also address key local environmental challenges. These awards, together with the launch of the climate solver virtual platform for knowledge-sharing and collaboration amongst different stakeholders, will help in strengthening and broad-basing the cleantech ecosystem in the country.”

 
In his address, Sh. C. K. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Govt. of India said, “India is a crucial player in the journey to combat climate change and SMEs play a critical role in it. However, global learning and local solutions are the key with solutions emerging from within the country itself. It is imperative to reward and encourage SMEs, and for the government to create a conducive ecosystem to help them scale up. The narrative is to work together towards development and ecology conservation for which the government and industry must work in collaboration.”

 
Notes to the Editor:
WWF's Climate Solver platform first began in Sweden in 2008 and launched in India in 2012 which further expanded to include countries like China and South Africa. WWF-India has been partnering with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), New Ventures India, Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship (IIM Ahmedabad), Indian Angel Network, National Innovation Foundation and Technology Development Board (Department of Science and Technology, Government of India) for the Climate Solver initiative.
