On the occasion of ‘World Environment Day’, Mayor, District Magistrate and City Commissioner come forward to encourage students as they create illustrations on ‘Think. Eat. Save Ramganga. Save Planet’
Moradabad: The city of Moradabad celebrated the World Environment Day is a unique style, with over 200 school children painting their vision for the Ramganga river and pledging for its restoration. ‘Think. Eat. Save Ramganga. Save Planet’ painting competition was an exceptional event that aimed to celebrate, recognize and reward young students’ interpretation and creative skills by giving them opportunities to enhance their understanding on the issue of environment conservation.



Through this competition, WWF-India’s Rivers for Life programme aimed to bring attention to the fact that more wastage of food is also equivalent to wastage of water -both impacting Ramganga River. ‘Think. Eat. Save Ramganga. Save Planet’ drawing competition got several thought provoking illustrations on food and water wastage’s impact on the ecological wellbeing of the river. WWF-India, with the support of the District Administration of Moradabad, created this competition to nurture emerging young talent in the city and to provide a platform for engaging them in Ramganga conservation activities.



“District Administration is taking up conservation of Ramganga as a priority. To achieve our shared vision it is vital to mobilize young adult’s participation in conservation activities and develop a coordinated framework for collaboration between all stakeholders. It is imperative to pause and think about the existing exploitation of the environment and the fact that none of us are productively contributing for its betterment. The thumb rule of environment is that it reaps what one sows. The painting competition on the theme ‘Think. Eat. Save Ramganga. Save Planet’ tries to highlight the growing food wastage and brings the thought to the forefront that we can reduce the wastage of water by reducing the food wastage. Also, lets pledge today that we would reduce our consumption of polythene, would plant one sapling each year and ensure the conservation of water at our respective households!’, said Shri Sanjay Kumar, IAS, District Magistrate.



According to a recent study done by United Nations, most part of the world water consumption depends on food production. Every year 30% of it is wasted. We can reduce the wastage of water reducing the food waste. Also, United Nation’s theme for 2013 World Environment Day celebrations is. ‘Think. Eat. Save’, which is an anti-food waste and food loss campaign that encourages everyone to reduce one’s food print. 

The winners of the competition, Ms. Richa Jaitely, Ms. Fabiha Khan and Ms. Ashkara received much appreciation by the senior Government officials present at the event. “The winning paintings beautifully encourage everyone to become more aware of the environmental impact of the food choices one makes and empowers everyone to make informed decisions. My blessings are with all the children for their bright future ahead,” said Mrs. Veena Aggarwal, Mayor, Moradabad. The Winner and two Honorable Mentions each received WWF-India mementos from the city’s Mayor. Additionally, all the participants received a certificate of appreciation from the District Magistrate and City Commissioner, Mr. S.K, Singh. City commissioner added ‘’Children are the future torch bearers of our society and it is important that we make them aware about the increasing pollution levels and various ways to counter this issue.”



Mr. Suresh Babu, Director, River Basins & Water Policy, WWF-India added, “Being aware of one’s own water and ecological footprint is the first and the most important step towards conserving Ramganga. At WWF-India we believe that these fun activities are powerful means of engaging young adults in tackling development challenges, and hold the potential to transform the pace and nature of development. Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga campaign also aims to engage with students as they are the future change makers for our society.”
