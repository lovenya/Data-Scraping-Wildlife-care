The soldiers patrolling the border of India are not only protecting their mother land. They are now saving red pandas too!



On 5th April ’09, a team of soldiers from Sasastra Sema Bal (An army battalion which guards India’s borders with Nepal and China) rescued a female red panda from the jaws of a dog. This dog, which belongs to a yak owner from across the border in Nepal, had inflicted serious bite wounds on the neck of the red panda. Dogs are used by locals here to protect their yaks from attacks by wild animals while grazing illegally inside the park.





The soldiers after rescuing the highly endangered red panda took her to their camp where they provided her with emergency medical care. Later, personnel from the Forest Department with the help of a volunteer from WWF-India helped to transport the injured red panda in a jeep to the Darjeeling zoo for further treatment. 



WWF-India has been working in these regions for the last five years to conserve the little red panda population left there. Through project-S.E.R.V.E (Save the Environment & Regenerate Vital Employment-Darjeeling), WWF has been working to preserve the environment of Darjeeling Hills, restore critical habitats and create awareness in environmental conservation since last 13 years. Initiatives have also been made to improve the livelihood of the local communities. 



During November 2008, WWF-India, Project S.E.R.V.E in collaboration with Wild Life Division l, Forest Department, Government of West Bengal organised various camps for sensitising SSB (Sasastra Sema Bal) personnels on wildlife crime control along the Indo-Nepal Border of Singalila National Park, Darjeeling. The focus was to apprise them of the Wildlife Protection Act and more important was to make them aware about their role and responsibility in controlling wildlife trade and crime along these border regions, a hotspot of criminals who use the border to escape the law. A pocket size field guide book displaying major species of this Park and some information on Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972 was also provided to them. 



Since, the terrain is hostile is, especially in the monsoons, WWF has proposed to train the soldiers to rescue wild animals here. Because in case of such an eventuality, the rescue team could take upto 2 days to reach the spot. Through this training, the soldiers who are present here throughout the year could treat the endangered animals in distress and could provide them with immediate medical treatment. WWF will provide requisite medicines to the SSB camps for this purpose.



Every year many red pandas get killed due to such attacks. WWF is also in talks with the Forest Department to remove these illegal dogs because they pose a serious threat to the existence of red pandas here and other important species here. Soldiers Save a Red Panda from Near Death
