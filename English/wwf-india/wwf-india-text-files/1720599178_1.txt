The 9th annual convention of the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI) held in Srinagar from September 12-15 brought together adventure tour operators from the whole country, particularly from the states of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Kerala. Sponsored by the Jammu & Kashmir Tourism department and supported by Incredible India, the convention focused on the clear objective of ‘creating opportunities, marketing, networking and capacity building for the Indian adventure tourism industry’. 



At the inaugural ceremony of the convention were present the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir, Mr. Omar Abdullah; Secretary, Ministry of Tourism, Mr. R.H. Khawaja; Minister of Tourism and Culture, Jammu & Kashmir, Mr. Nawang Rigzin Jora; and renowned explorer, adventurer and travel writer, Mr. Garry Weare. 



“We can’t treat the Himalayas as a huge adventure playground. We need to be responsible,” said Mr. Garry Weare, while talking about how adventure tourism can be revived in India, and especially in Jammu & Kashimir. Mr. R.H. Khawaja added to that saying, “Safe, honourable and sustainable tourism is what we need. How many of us think about individual social responsibility?”



As part of the Adventure Tourism exhibition, WWF-India set up a Green Hiker awareness stall, drawing attention to the importance of responsible tourism practices in the industry. While the convention emphasized greatly on how to revive and boost adventure tourism in India, Green Hiker brought in a balanced perspective, one which tour operators cannot afford to ignore. Journey of a Green Hiker – the Green Hiker animation film was screened at the stall during the course of the convention, reaching out to tour operators and government officials at once. 



The Green Hiker pocket booklet called ‘Green hiking in the Himalayas’ recently published was very well received by the delegates of the convention, who were seen going through it with great interest. It is hoped that this would help them to infuse sustainable ‘green hiking’ measures into their businesses.



As adventure tourism revs up to make its presence felt in India, inviting more tourists to opt for it, attention is being paid to growing, but growing in a sustainable manner. Green Hiker at the 9th Annual Convention of ATOAI
