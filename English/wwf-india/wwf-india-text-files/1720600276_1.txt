Tumkur, Karnataka: A three day Walkathon, ‘Namma Nagini, Namma Jeeva Dani’  was organized by WWF-India under the aegis of HSBC’s Aadhrabhoomi- Wetlands for Life programme to sensitize key stakeholders on the importance of wetland rejuvenation. Flagged off by Shri H.C. Balakrishna MLA Magadi Taluk in Srigiripura, the ceremony witnessed the coming together of 200 people including government officials, Gram and Zilla Panchayat members, students from Hemadri college, local community members, 15 participating NGOs and HSBC employees.



“There is an urge to conserve and revive the nearest wetland systems that are accessible to communities as the loss of cascade tanks has adversely impacted their livelihoods and water consumption. This can be leveraged with support from the government and NGOs to develop a collaborative action plan to begin the restoration of wetlands” said Ramchandra Gowda, MLC Bangalore Rural. Speaking on the Walkathon, Mr. Suresh Babu, Director, Rivers, Wetlands and Water Policy, WWF-India said, “The Walkathon aims to bring together local communities, policy makers and other key stakeholders at a common platform to discuss and plan action that can be taken to restore the Nagini rivulet. Kere Sanrakshana Samitis were formed at the villages as the first step to developing a wetland management plan”  



The group passed through the villages of Srigiripura, Gunndigare, Hulikal and Mysandra stopping periodically to interact with people and generate dialogues on the importance of rejuvenating the Nagini stream. Their perceptions on the health of Kunigal Doddakere and solutions to address them were also recorded through informal discussions. In each of the villages, people came forth to express their commitment by signing a pledge to join the collaborative conservation efforts. These resolutions would be compiled and presented at the multi stakeholder meeting on the last day of the Walkathon at Kunigal which will culiminate in the setting up of a Wetland Restoration Committee that implements the wetland rejuvenation plan. 35 km Walkathon to Spark Dialogue and Action on Wetland Restoration flags off in Tumkur District, Bangalore
