In the wake of the 15th meeting in Doha in 2010, the Conference of Parties suggested that progress in Rhino range countries would have to be examined with regards to curtailing illegal trade in Rhinoceros parts and derivatives. The Secretariat currently is urging all parties to submit information measures taken to reduce the illegal trade in Rhinoceroses and their parts and derivatives. The Secretariat also solicits information on measures taken to enhance existing controls on trade in Rhinoceros horn products and live Rhinoceroses to ensure the long term survival of the species. The Secretariat in a notification in February, 2012 recommends that parties should submit this information by 15 April 2012.
