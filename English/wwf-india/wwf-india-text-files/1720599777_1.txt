India is currently the fourth largest primary energy consumer in the world. Due to its rapidly growing economy and rising population, this would mean that India is in urgent need of low carbon growth − economic growth that has a low carbon footprint and so, has less environmental impact. 



The need of the hour is to access current state policies and encourage formulation of policies that promote low carbon growth, and development that is sustainable. 



Towards this purpose, the Low-Carbon Growth Policy Tracker study highlighting low carbon policies and interventions in 10 states of India was launched by WWF-India on 30 April 2013. 



Developed with technical inputs from Ernst & Young LLP, the tracker assesses low carbon policies across various states in India, evaluates their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encourages new policies that promote low-carbon development in the states.
