WWF-India launched its retail report "Global Practices in Environmental Sustainability: A Roadmap for Indian Retail" on 5 February 2014 at the RAI Leadership Summit in Mumbai. The launch was followed by a panel discussion on Emerging Trends: Sustainability in Retail, also organized by WWF, with the objective of drawing the link between retail, supply chain and WWF Conservation agenda, highlighting their linkage to the key commodities.



The report was launched by Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO-President, WWF-India, who highlighted the importance of sustainability in retail sector. He pointed out that, “Over the next few years and with the entry of global retail giants like IKEA, Marks and Spencer, Carrefour and others, the organized retail industry in India will change considerably and move from looking at sustainability as a cost center to perceiving it as an opportunity to reduce risk, improve relationships with customers & employers and deliver better products.” 



The report provides contextual insights that traditional perceptions of environmental sustainability in India need reconsideration. It keeps a strict focus on global practices in environmental sustainability and throws light on initiatives undertaken by some of the largest retailers around the world. It also provides examples from nine global retailers that focus on the key areas of: energy conservation and emission reduction; green and sustainable products; packaging; supply chain; waste reduction and recycling; biodiversity conservation water conservation; presence of environmental policy; green buildings and environmental reporting.

The report showcases how sustainability has become a core consideration for most of the global retailers and has led to long term profitability to the businesses. Citing examples of nine global retail giants like Carrefour, H&M, IKEA, Inditex, M&S, Tesco, Walmart. Whole foods and Woolworths, the report throws light on the initiatives taken by these large retailers which can be translated in the Indian retail industry as well. The report provides a roadmap for the Indian retail industry to improve on the existing understanding and also expand the scope of sustainability in retail. 



The report concludes with recommendations such that Indian retailers may take advantage of the changing trends in the retail industry and can become more competitive in the increasingly globalized marketplace.

WWF-India has been working to transform the way businesses operate and reduce their ecological footprint and develop innovative sustainable solutions. Through its sustainable business programme, WWF-India aims to transform the markets by promoting sustainability in the trade of various key soft commodities that have a high footprint in a national and global context.
