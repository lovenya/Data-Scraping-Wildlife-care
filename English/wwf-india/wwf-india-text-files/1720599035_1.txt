WWF-India’s six young volunteers, including three women, were abducted on Sunday 6th February while conducting field monitoring for the All India Tiger Estimation Project in Chirang Forest Division of Western Assam. Three of the abducted women volunteers were released in the evening of 8th Feb and are well. WWF-India has sought the support of the government authorities at the highest level and working towards a safe release of the remaining three male volunteers. 



We continue to believe that our intentions of conservation are in absolute good faith and have no bearing on any political agenda. We are hopeful that our values and work in the region will prevail soon and help us in our efforts to solve this crisis. We understand the enormity of the situation and are working with the authorities to come to a resolution to the crisis at hand.



WWF-India is thankful to the Govt of Assam as well as the local community and civil society groups for stepping in with their support and hopes for their continued attention till the crisis is resolved. 



We, along with the families of the volunteers, strongly appeal to all our partners, media and individuals towards continuing the support that they have shown in the last three days, in trying to maintain tranquility and move towards a quick end to the situation.
