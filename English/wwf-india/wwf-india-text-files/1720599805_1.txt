WWF-India helps strengthen wireless communication networks in the Western Ghats
The Western Ghats

The Western Ghats has a spectacular assemblage of large mammals - around 30% of the world’s Asian elephant population and 17% of the world’s existing wild tigers call this area their home. Protection for these is extended through several nationally significant Wildlife Sanctuaries, Tiger Reserves, and National Parks. The region is also a global Biodiversity Hotspot and includes a diversity of ecosystems containing numerous medicinal plants and important genetic resources such as the wild relatives of grains, fruit and spices.



WWF-India has been active in the Western Ghats since the early 90s and has been working to identify and map critical wildlife corridors, manage human-elephant conflict, strengthen Protected Area management, promote sustainable livelihoods and assess the status of key species like the tiger and Nilgiri tahr outside Protected Areas and to develop conservation strategies for them.



The importance of wireless communication 

The modern age is defined by the spread of communication technologies that enable rapid and efficient information transfer. Wireless communication is one such technology that is a critical requirement for India’s frontline forest staff and enables them to respond to challenges quickly. The extensive use of the wireless protocol as a quick and efficient method of communication has been in place for many years along the entire strip of the Nilgiri range in the southern Western Ghats region. The purpose of these wireless tools is to enable better and timely sharing of information from the field and coordinate responses. However, interference caused by increasing usage of mobile telephony affected the efficiency of the wireless communication network used by the Tamil Nadu Forest Department.







Working of Wireless Repeaters
Say A, B and C are the routers and X, Y and Z are its corresponding repeaters. Routers have a certain network range, which only stretches as far. The repeaters are placed in such a way that it picks up signals from two or three routers and distributes it to a longer range. 



Thus, the network spreads over the entire box with the help of repeaters. Far corners on either side of A get full range and forest staff is able to communicate without any interference issues. Remote locations get proper coverage in this manner.






The efficiency of wireless communication can be improved by deploying wireless repeaters (see box). By installing such repeaters, the network and reach of the installed routers expands massively. Communication in areas with no routers installed becomes easier and clearer. Therefore, after discussion with the Tamil Nadu Forest Department, WWF-India helped in implementing wireless repeaters across the Nilgiris, in areas such as Glen Morgan, upper and lower Sigur plateau, Moyar Valley and the Sathyamanglam forests. 



“There is a remarkable change in the communication network after the installation of these wireless repeaters. This helps the forest staff in efficient patrolling. Also, areas which were earlier remote for wireless communication are now well connected due to the appropriate location of these repeaters”, said Mr. Boominathan, Landscape Coordinator, Western Ghats Landscape, WWF-India.



To make sure that the system functions without any hitch in the long run, WWF-India is also undertaking regular training of the forest staff in the usage of wireless sets. The staff will also be trained and equipped to undertake regular maintenance checks and basic repair work of the components making up the repeater system. 



“Installation of wireless repeaters by WWF-India has helped in bridging the time gap between the control center and the field team. Information on incidents of poaching are now passed on to the base camp at the shortest possible time, resulting in a planned response to the event,” said Mr. Rajkumar, DFO, Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.



WWF-India will continue to work with the individual state forest departments in the Western Ghats and support such innovative initiatives that will help the frontline forest staff better protect India’s rich biodiversity.
