Tsomgo Pokhri Sanrakshan Samiti (TPSS), the first Lake Conservation Committee formed in Sikkim, was given the best NGO award for their work on cleanliness campaigns on the occasion of World Tourism Day on 30 September 2013 by the Honourable Chief Minister Dr Pawan Kumar Chamling.



“The prestigious state award for best NGO in the cleanliness campaign for PSS is recognition of all the efforts of PSS so far. Receiving this award makes us feel encouraged to do more in the future”, said Ms Rinzing Doma, President, Tsomgo Pokhri Sanrakshan Samiti. 



TPSS was formed in 2008 under the Lake Conservation Guidelines notified by the Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department. Tsomgo Lake is one of the most visited tourist spots in Sikkim, with an estimated 3,00,000 tourists visiting the wetland every year. While tourism boosts the local economy by providing jobs and income for the locals, it also had an impact on the environment of Tsomgo. To enhance community partnership for management and conservation of the wetland, TPSS was constituted by the state government with support of NGOs like The Mountain Institute, Sindrabong Khangchendzonga Ecofriendly Society and WWF-India. Since its formation, WWF has been supporting TPSS through capacity-building programmes and also in effective functioning. 



The committee includes one person from each household in the vicinity of the lake catchment as member. The panchayat of the ward is the President and the Range Officer of the Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department (FEWMD), Government of Sikkim is the member Secretary of the Samiti. The Samiti has executive members from Taxi Drivers’ Association, Tourism Department, Police Department, Shopkeepers’ Association and locals. 



TPSS is given the power to be the local custodian of Tsomgo Lake and entrusted with the collection of a conservation fee from each tourist visiting Tsomgo. Fifty per cent of the collected conservation fee is deposited with the State Environment Agency. The money is again given back for conservation of the lake and other threatened wetlands that need immediate attention. The remaining 50 per cent of the collected fees is used for various conservation activities budgeted under the Annual Lake Conservation Plan. So far, TPSS has collected around INR 8.2 million from tourists visiting Tsomgo Lake. 



An Annual Lake Conservation Plan is prepared in consultation with local communities which is shared with the government stakeholders for their inputs. The plan includes various activities like awareness programmes, capacity building, garbage management and community development work. Since their formation, TPSS has been actively involved in various activities for managing the lake, as well as for conservation of culture and tradition of the communities living there.



One of the biggest achievements for the conservation of the lake was relocating the shops by the state government from above the lake side to a shopping complex that was constructed at a different location near the lake, which would not have been possible without the cooperation of TPSS. This relocation has greatly reduced the pressure on the lake. 



The other successful intervention where the continuous efforts of TPSS made a difference is the management of garbage around the lakeside and shopping complex. Working under the principles of zero waste they have come up with a well planned Resource Recovery Centre in Tsomgo where the garbage coming from each shop is segregated to minimize the volume of discards, which is later transferred to the landfill sites. For further reduction of voluminous plastic waste, TPSS have also provided water filters in the shops to cut down on the use of packaged drinking water. 



TPSS members regularly conduct awareness generation programmes with the Tsomgo community, and all important days for conservation like World Environment Day, World Water Day are observed with great energy and enthusiasm. Similarly, the revival of the Bhadaurey Poornima festival, one of the most celebrated festivals in Tsomgo in the past was one more achievement of the TPSS in conserving local culture and traditions as well.



“It is a great achievement for TPSS to have received this State award. It is an acknowledgement and recognition of the hard work they have put in for conservation of Tsomgo since 2008. We hope this will also be a good motivation for the members of TPSS to excel further in carrying out their responsibilities”, added Mr NT Bhutia, Divisional Forest Officer, Territorial Division, East District, FEWMD.



Today, though major threats have been reduced, Tsomgo still needs the dedication and effort of all its stakeholders. WWF-India will continue to support TPSS to ensure that the natural beauty of the lake can continue to be appreciated by tourists in a sustainable and responsible manner.
