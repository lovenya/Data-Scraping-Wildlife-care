Justice Madan B Lokur, Judge of Delhi High Court, delivering the IX Green Law Lecture at the convocation ceremony of Centre of Environment Law students (CEL) of WWF-India, emphasized on the need of strong environmental legislation and its enforcement for renewed conservation effort. 



Speaking on the occasion, Justice Lokur said, “In India, it is quite clear, and unfortunately so, that the development of environmental jurisprudence has been mainly due to the efforts of the Supreme Court due to the inefficiency of the current environmental regime, since even though the statutes and legislation are well defined and stringent, their implementation and enforcement have not been efficient. 



He added, “A major problem with the application of the environmental laws is the conflict of values and interests – the value of protection of the environment in the interest of all, versus production (industrial and otherwise) for the good of all. The right jurisprudential approach to environmental legislation would only be one that seeks a resolution to the conflict of these values. Ideally, the regulators of the environment and the producers who use natural resources must be one and the same. Only laws which lead to this end can be said to have the right spirit.” 



CEL organizes the annual Green Law lecture as a part of its convocation ceremony for outgoing students of its diploma course. The topic for this year’s Green Law Lecture was: Environmental Law: Its development and jurisprudence. Eminent lawyers, academicians and judges of High Courts have delivered lectures in the past. 



Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, “It is a proud moment for us to confer the diploma in environmental law to this year’s CEL students. Introduced in 1993, the Diploma is the first such comprehensive programme of environ-legal education for India and the South Asia and continues to contribute learned professionals in the field of environmental law.” 



Dr. Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF-India, “We expect that like other CEL graduates, this batch will also go on to be strong advocates of environment and will also become long-term associates of WWF-India”
