G8 leaders turn towards Copenhagen but road map still missing

L-Aquila, Italy- G8 leaders today recognized the need to keep temperature increases below the two degree limit recognised as presenting unacceptable risks of catastrophic climate change - but have yet to outline immediate actions to achieve this goal.



WWF welcomes the leaders’ initiative but the lack of an agreement on ambitious midterm emissions reduction targets, clear financial commitments and a date for global peak and decline of emissions could turn the 2 degree commitment into an empty statement, the global environment group said.



“World leaders have come down to earth. We welcome them back here but why have they failed to tell us how they want to achieve what they promise,” said Kim Carstensen, the leader of the WWF Global Climate Initiative. 



Carstensen said the G8 commitment to reduce their emissions by 80 per cent or more by 2050 is welcome news, but it does not compensate for the lack of clear and ambitious short-term targets. “What are they going to do between now and 2020?” he asked.



An ambitious midterm target for 2020 of developed countries is needed to ensure immediate action and so far the emission reduction pledges by individual industrialised countries did not add up to the level of action needed.



"Without setting the path to reduce emissions, the actual obligations of countries will be watered down, and staying below 2 degrees will be impossible," he said.  



WWF believes the group of industrialised countries should cut emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. The US should take a comparable target, in nature, legal form and effort.



The global conservation organisation also asks developed countries to put forward a financial commitment of 160 billion USD a year for emission cuts and adaptation to climate impacts in the developing world.
