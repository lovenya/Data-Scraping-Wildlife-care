JGLS and WWF India comes live with the alumnae of LL.M. (Environmental Law, Energy and Climate Change) to “Decode Specialization in Green Laws”.  Three alumnae of JGLS-WWF India will share their experience and take us through the programme by decoding the specialization for prospective applicants interested in pursuing the LL.M. in Environmental Law, Energy and Climate Change. Environmental laws or 'green laws' encompass a wide spectrum of legislation, regulations and policies surrounding the protection, preservation and conservation of different forms of life on earth and their interaction with the natural environment. Environmental laws have become now an integral part of any project, initiatives and services, taken up by businesses, NGOs and governments across the world. Green laws help create regulatory structures  for environmental management and assist in managing, suppressing, controlling, and limiting detrimental  environmental impacts. Most importantly, green laws encourage and foster environmentally conscious attitudes and behavior.
 
We present to you Ms. Vidhi Thukral, Environmental Lawyer; Mr. Neeraj Nachiketan, Advocate, Supreme Court and Delhi High Court; and Mr. Divya Abhishek, Ex-Deputy Manager, State Bank of India. Come join us on this journey of unravelling the specialization in green laws.”
