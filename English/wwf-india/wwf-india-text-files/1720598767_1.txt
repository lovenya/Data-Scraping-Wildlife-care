New Dehli, India: WWF welcomes the early lead on continuing climate negotiations and the level of commitment shown by the BASIC group of countries to a fair and effective UN-based outcome to climate change this year.



 “It is highly encouraging that these key emerging economies intend to further outline their voluntary mitigation actions by January 31, and that they now declare an intention of taking climate action together in areas like technology, adaptation and research”, says Shirish Sinha of WWF India.



“This presents a good challenge to developed countries, who must also meet the end of January deadline with their own announcement of carbon emission reduction targets, and who must also live up to their promises of providing financial support to the vulnerable countries,” said Kim Carstensen, Leader of the WWF Global Climate Initiative.



“WWF will watch them closely to see whether their commitments actually match their assertions in Copenhagen that they are committed to keep the world below the level where the risk of climate catastrophe becomes unacceptable.”
