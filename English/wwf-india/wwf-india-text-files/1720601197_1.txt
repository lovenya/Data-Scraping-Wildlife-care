New Delhi: Owls are commonly found in the illegal wildlife trade in India due to various superstitions and taboos attached to them. Despite the immense ecological role of owls in our ecosystem, these endangered birds are trapped in large numbers for sacrifice and use in multiple rituals often promoted by local mystic practitioners.

 

In light of this, TRAFFIC and WWF-India’s new identification (ID) tools for strengthening owl protection were launched on 3 March 2022 on the occasion of World Wildlife Day by Mr Bharat Jyoti, Director-IGNFA; Dr AJT Johnsingh, Emminent Wildlife Scientist; Mr Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF-India; Ms Nidhi Srivastava, Principal, CASFOS; and Dr Saket Badola, Head, TRAFFIC India at CASFoS (Central Academy for State Forest Service), Dehradun.



The owl identification tools are in the form of ID cards to enable law enforcement authorities to accurately identify 16 commonly found owl species in the illegal wildlife trade. The ID cards are available in English and Hindi and will be distributed free to wildlife law enforcement agencies across India.

 

Authored by Dr Saket Badola, IFS, Head of TRAFFIC's India office and Dr Merwyn Fernandes, Coordinator, TRAFFIC's India office, the new ID tools provide essential information related to the species' legal status, habitat, and distribution. They provide valuable tips on identifying the owls at species level and highlight common threats.

 

On this occasion Dr Saket Badola said, "The main strategies to recover key wildlife species is to provide them a safe habitat and protect them from the threats of poaching and illegal trade. Protecting owls will support ecosystem restoration and biodiversity. Therefore, echoing with this year's theme of World Wildlife Day (WWD), "Recovering key species for ecosystem restoration", we are releasing these ID cards that will help wildlife law enforcement officials in their endeavours to protect the wildlife of India."



India is home to about 36 owl species, all protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, making their hunting, trade, or any other form of utilisation a punishable offence. All owl species found in India are also enlisted under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts their international trade.



Despite the legal protection, owls are often seen in the illegal wildlife trade. Since 2019, at least 20 seizure incidences related to the poaching and trafficking of owls have been reported in India, while many more go unreported. 

 

Mr Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India, adds, "Owls play an essential ecological role in our ecosystem. They enhance agricultural productivity by keeping a check on the rodent populations. Unless trafficking and illicit trade of owls is controlled, the owl populations will remain under threat. Adequate conservation and protection efforts for owls and other endangered species is crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem".

World Wildlife Day (WWD) is celebrated every year on 3 March, and this year's theme is "Recovering key species for ecosystem restoration". The celebrations will seek to draw attention to the conservation status of some of the most critically endangered species of wild fauna and flora and to drive discussions towards imagining and implementing solutions to conserve them.
