The Jungle Gang is the first Indian wildlife film series that has been made exclusively for children and young adults. The mission of the film series is to expose them to the diverse wild flora and fauna of India and encourage them to actively participate in wildlife conservation.



The film has three animated animal characters – Bo- the Bar Headed Goose, Kuttu- the Slender Loris and Bhoora- the Blackbuck. These three friends bring the flavour of three different habitats of India. They travel together to different parts of the country and seek out the threatened animals to tell about their habitats, threats and conservations efforts, which have saved them from extinction. 



The animals they meet are the Indian one horned rhino, the tiger, the elephant and the sloth bear. The film series is a mix of animation and live action wildlife footage. Each film in the series is about 15 mins in length and has been dubbed into Assamese, Hindi and Tamil to reach out to a wider audience. The series has been created by Earthcare Films of Mr. Krishnendu Bose and financially supported by WWF-India.



During the release event the guests was welcomed by Dr. Harish Guleria, Head, Terai Arc Landscape, WWF-India. Dr. Dipankar Ghose, Director, Species and Landscapes programme, WWF-India talked about how the Jungle Gang films would help in spreading the message of conservation.

I congratulate the filmmaker and WWF-India for making such a special series using the powerful medium of film to target children.”



The Special Guest, Mr. Chandra Singh Gwal added, “I’m particularly happy that the film series has been dubbed into languages like Hindi, Tamil and Assamese as this will really help the film series find a large audience. We need more films like these to ensure that the message of conservation is spread far and wide and I hope that more schools in Dehradun get to see these films.”

The filmmaker, Mr. Krishnendu Bose, then took part in an interactive session with the children in the audience and shared his experiences and the challenges in making the film series.
