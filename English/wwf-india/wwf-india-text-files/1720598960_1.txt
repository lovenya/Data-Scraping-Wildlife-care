Notebooks with message to conserve tiger distributed among school children of Satpura - Maikal Landscape

The Central Indian Satpura Maikal Landscape (SML) is the region surrounding Satpura and Maikal hill ranges in west and east respectively and is spread across 14 districts of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. This region is home to some of India’s best known protected areas and put together around 15% of the world’s tigers* are found here. Apart from rich wildlife SML is also home to human population that often lives in close proximity to forests and is also dependent on them for their survival. Many indigenous tribes are found here like Gonds, Baigas, Korkus, Bhils and Kols. 



Conservation through paper

WWF-India aims to reduce poaching in the landscape and help restore the tiger habitats, particularly the corridors that connect the tiger breeding areas. In this direction it interacts with the local communities and the schools. To impart awareness on conservation of tiger and its habitat among the children living in the landscape so that the upcoming generation supports tiger conservation, since May 2010 WWF-India has printed and distributed notebooks among 10,000 school children of the landscape. The customized notebook ‘Meri Bagh Pustika’ with text in Hindi also speaks about the benefits of conservation to the local people. The response to the notebook has been very positive.



According to Rajeshwar, student of Manze Tola Prathmik Shala (primary school) in Kharidih village, “I will read out the message of tiger conservation mentioned in the notebook to my parents.” 



The teachers of the schools where the books were distributed also appreciated the initiative. Mr. Shivpal Dhurve, a teacher at Rajeshwar’s school said, “This book is useful to the students to read and write and will also teach them the importance of protecting the forests and wildlife.” Mr. Indar Marawi, teacher at the Chownki Tola primary school in the same village adds, “The illustrations and the text in the notebook will increase the curiosity of the children towards conservation and help them in knowing more about the same.” In August 2010, these notebooks were distributed among the school children of 23 schools in 6 villages of the landscape where WWF-India has been working.



Forest department supports initiative

The Forest Department of Madhya Pradesh has supported the initiative and is in favour of expanding it to more areas. Mr. Agarawal, Conservator of Forests, Dindori Division, Madhya Pradesh said, “Through the medium of such notebooks, the children will get to know more about the tiger and its habitat. This should not be limited to the children of villages alone. It should also be expanded to cover children living deep inside the jungles so that they can also know more about the importance of tiger conservation.”



Taking note of the positive response and requests for expanding the program, the notebook is being printed in Marathi to educate children in the Maharashtra part of the SML. Also, similarly customized notebooks are being produced in other landscapes where WWF-India is working, to carry the message of conservation to the younger audience.



*The present world tiger population is estimated to be around 2800-3000, of which India might have around 1400. Satpura-Maikal Landscape is estimated to have a population of 325-430. Educating the future tiger defenders of Central India
