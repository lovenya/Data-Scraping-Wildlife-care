‘Conservation on Canvas’, the art exhibition, is a repository of over 30 canvases that capture the critical issues of environment conservation, bringing to life the splendid and myriad colors of nature and its intricate relationship with human beings. Renowned artists of India have come forward to join hands with WWF-India to support its conservation efforts in the country by painting for the cause or giving a painting from their collection.



The key objective of the project ‘Conservation on Canvas’ is to create awareness and garner involvement and support for WWF-India’s conservation programmes. The uniqueness of the ‘Conservation on Canvas’ project is that it is an ongoing campaign. The innovative campaign will catch the attention of interested audiences, through art forms that depict information that stays with them.



‘Conservation on Canvas’ also creates a unique opportunity of bringing various stakeholders on a common platform for a common mission such as the government, corporate and individuals supporters, creative agencies, media, celebrities and the world of art.



‘Conservation on Canvas’ was launched at an exclusive event at Taj Palace, New Delhi on the 18th of April, 2012. 



The purpose of this innovative tool is to sensitize opinion leaders and masses towards leaving a living planet for future generations with WWF-India.



According to Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, “Initiatives like ‘Conservation on Canvas’ provide us with an innovative platform to engage with a wider audience, to generate awareness and spread our message of conservation. It is inspiring to see so many renowned artists come forward to support this cause. We understand the necessity to broadcast the message of conservation in many and creative forms and this in one such initiative. We thank the artists contributing and those bringing this event together.”



“One of WWF India's main objectives is to spread awareness and garner support for conservation, through mediums which are effective and impactful. When eminent artists of India and Sri Lanka joined hands in our initiative, to paint for the cause and share their works on nature, there could not have been a better harmony between the colours from a brush and the canvas of nature bringing ''Conservation on Canvas'' to life.

This project will support three focal programmes of WWF India - Study and research the habitat of selected aquatic fauna, understanding the crucial role played by forest corridors and the threats they face in the different tiger landscape complexes in India and the protection of smaller and not so glamorous species which are equally endangered and some critically on the verge of extinction. - stated Ms. Madhur Das, Director – Conservation Alliances, WWF-India.



Focus programmes supported by ‘Conservation on Canvas’:

Three focal WWF-India conservation programmes have been identified that are in need of immediate attention. These are:



Freshwater Riverine Species: Freshwater species and habitats, on an average around the world, are more imperiled than their terrestrial counterparts. The objective of this Freshwater programme of WWF-India is to study and research the habitat of selected aquatic fauna; such as River Dolphins, Otters, selected species of Turtles, Sarus Cranes and the Gharials. WWF-India has initiated several projects for the conservation of these freshwater species.



Corridor Protection in Landscapes: Corridors are essential for animals to disperse between source populations, thereby allowing genetic and demographic exchange between populations and facilitating ecological processes that have evolved over thousands of years. Understanding the crucial role played by corridors and the threats they face, WWF-India has been working in critical corridors in the different tiger landscape complexes in India.



WWF-India’s work includes working with local communities living in the corridors to secure and develop sustainable livelihoods, providing alternate energy sources, education and outreach work, research and monitoring of tigers co-predators and prey, and guiding policy interventions in the landscape based on our work.



Other Endangered Species: WWF-India is known to protect the flagship endangered species including the glamorous animals such as the tiger, elephant and the rhino. But, what is little known is that we also work with a lot of other species who are equally endangered and some critically on the verge of extinction. WWF-India has launched a ‘Save the Smaller Species’ drive. Smaller species, often neglected, form the backbone of the food chain. Placed at the bottom of the food chain, an abundance of small species signifies a healthy eco system.



The other endangered species include the Nilgiri Tahr, Red Panda, Black Necked Crane, Sparrow, Great Indian Bustard, Snow Leopard, Golden Langur and the Asiatic Lion. Conservation on Canvas
