On the occasion of World Environment Day, WWF-India organized an environmental celebration at the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) in Kullu, Himachal Pradesh. The celebration was held at the Community Training Centre at GHNP and the venue itself was a picturesque reminder of the silent beauty of the region, enveloped by dense pine forests and the gushing Tirthan River. It was based on the 2013 theme of ‘Think. Eat. Save. Reduce your footprint’



The celebration started with a welcome address by Vandana Thaplayal, WWF-India, followed by a speech on the theme by Pankaj Chandan, WWF-India, wherein he informed the audience about how every year, 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted across the globe, putting tremendous pressure on natural resources as demand for increasing food production increases, as per data from the United Nations. Ms. Thaplyal also shared a presentation in order to spread awareness on the growing need to conserve and efficiently manage our natural resources.



On this occasion Chief Guest, A. K. Srivastava, Director of GHNP asked the local communities, as well as, school students to come forward and educate everyone about the importance of saving our precious food resources. He highlighted the fact that any waste be it of food or of water puts additional pressure on our limited resources.



Kiran Rajashekariah, Dr. Jatinder Kaur and Aadya Singh from WWF-India, were also present at the celebration. 



Finally, the students of GSSS Gushaini, GHS Manglore and other attendees participated in a Green March in solidarity with the marches being held all over the country by the Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organisation (HESCO) in commemoration of World Environment Day. The march was flagged off by the chief guest of the progarmme and passed through different parts of the village Gushaini and Sairopa. 



As a prequel to the celebrations on June 5, WWF-India and the GHNP authorities jointly organized an Essay Writing Competition and a Painting Competition for the students of the Government Senior Secondary School at Gushaini on June 4, the winners of which were awarded by the chief guest at the function.

World Environment day was founded on June 5, 1972 when leaders from 113 countries came together at the Stockholm Conference to discuss the future of planet Earth. It was the first time that awareness was being built up on a global scale about the impact of human development on the environment – a fact that had never been a concern before. The conference was also the birthplace of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), a global movement to combat climate change. Ever since, World Environment Day is celebrated annually on the anniversary of this historic conference. Taking into account the massive wastage of food that takes place the world over, the UNEP has promoted the theme ‘Think. Eat. Save. Reduce your footprint’ for World Environment Day 2013.
