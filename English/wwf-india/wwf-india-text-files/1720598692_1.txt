Carbon Disclosure Project Report 2009, India

Indian companies are way ahead in the region in disclosing their carbon emissions and setting performance targets for mitigation of GHG emissions. 
44 Indian companies have responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) this year. In the disclosure, companies reported on their carbon emissions data, reduction targets, associated risks and opportunities and increasingly board level managerial resources are spearheading the execution of climate change strategies within their organisations.
The most significant change from last years’ is that the responses have been improving both in terms of content and comprehensiveness.

New Delhi: Just days before the crucial UN climate talks in Copenhagen, close to 150 senior leaders from Indian business and industry came together to release the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Report 2009 – India 200. This is the third edition of the CDP India report since it was first published in 2007 and is based on the top 200 companies in India based on market capitalisation.



The CDP report substantiates the significance of climate change from India’s policies to the corporate boardrooms. The report brings out the challenges Indian companies are facing and outlines how they have integrated the long term value and costs of climate change impacts into their assessment of financial health and future prospects for their business. The disclosures are based on their commitments towards the environment and averting climate change. The disclosure process was carried out by the CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development and WWF-India in partnership with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The project is supported by the British High Commission, New Delhi.



Seema Arora, Head & Principal Counsellor, CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development, “the CDP Report is a means to encourage companies to voluntarily disclose their GHG emissions and also highlight the various risks and opportunities posed by climate change. Reports such as this send out clear signs that industry in India has adopted an approach that can help India leapfrog to a low carbon economy”.



Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, “In the last 3 years, we have seen a significant improvement in quality and comprehension of companies to responses indicating integration of climate concerns in their decision making. It is important that the Indian industry is seen participating in this initiatives given the imperatives of climate change and globalisation.”



British High Commissioner to India, Sir Richard Stagg said: "I'm pleased, and hugely impressed, at the way Indian companies are seeing the benefits of measuring and managing their carbon emissions. On the eve of Copenhagen, it's worth remembering that this is not a politically-driven decision. Rather, hard-headed and far-sighted businessmen are recognising that making money in the medium term will mean making a transition to a low-carbon model. And, as Indian business so often does, they're getting ahead of the pack. This can only be good for Indian business and for our shared, low carbon future." 



Paul Simpson, Chief Operating Officer, CDP said: “It is very positive to see that the ability and sophistication of the Indian companies who responded to CDP this year has increased. These companies are better able to measure and report their emissions and the leaders are setting energy and emissions reduction targets ahead of future regulation. Clearly as the world moves further to address climate change the leading Indian companies have a great opportunity to provide the world with low carbon products and services”



The results of third CDP India Report 2009 continue to build on the positive findings from 2008. Anant Raj Industries, Bharat Forge, Crompton Greaves, IFCI, Larsen & Toubro, Praj Industries, Tata Chemicals, Voltas are some of the additional companies that came on board this year. 



In CDP 2009, IDBI Bank Limited & Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) from India joined Yes Bank in the league of 475 investor signatories.



Key findings of the analysis:

63% of the companies disclosed their GHG emissions in CDP 2009, which is almost double as compared to only 33% in CDP6 (2008)
The overall total GHG emissions reported by the respondents of CDP 2009 stands at 68.9 million metric tones (MT), which is almost double the GHG emissions reported in the last two years
68% of the respondents to CDP 2009 have reduction plans in place for slashing either their energy or GHG emissions as compared to 61% last year
84% of the companies don’t consider existing regulatory mechanisms as a risk but rather as an opportunity for triggering long term investment in energy efficient technologies. However, these companies do acknowledge that in future, the regulations may affect their businesses 
82% of the companies acknowledge physical risks such as damage, disruption and displacement resulting due to climate change as some of the major challenges that could result in financial losses. 
This year a larger number of companies have not only started disclosing information on their GHG emissions, but they are also adopting more accurate methodologies for doing so and are providing categorical break-downs of their GHG emissions. While only 0.4 MT of Scope 2 emissions were reported in CDP6 (2008), the figure rose by ten times to 4 MT in CDP 2009.



Releasing the CDP Report 2009 – India 200, Mr N K Singh, Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, said, “We need to act with innovation and flexibility harmonizing national interest with global consensus for a satisfactory outcome”.



Anurag Behar, Chief Executive, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, talked of the role that business needs to play in turning climate risks into opportunities. “Climate change is one of the defining issues of our times, businesses must contribute to tackling this, this also presents innovative and large business growth opportunities in manufacturing, services & consulting” 

 

Anupam Srivastava, Sr Director, IDFC said, "Without the availability of the relevant information, and without strong links between company action and investor decisions, responses to climate change will be ineffective. This is why we at IDFC support projects such as CDP, which bring the right information to a broad range of stakeholders."



The third CDP report has clearly brought out that while all companies acknowledge that climate change has become an imperative, some of them have acknowledged this as an opportunity and are taking initiatives that will encourage many more companies to follow examples of good practices in disclosing emission and formulating reduction plans.
