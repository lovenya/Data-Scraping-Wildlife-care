How camera trapping by WWF-India helped track tigers that had gone missing
In early 2014, upon receiving numerous reports of tigers missing from the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in the State of Rajasthan, WWF-India’s Western India Tiger Landscape (WITL) team reached out to park officials to offer assistance in locating the missing tigers. These reports had caused widespread anxiety in the conservation community, as there were serious concerns about the status of these tigers, on whether they had simply dispersed out of the Tiger Reserve to establish new territories, or in the worst-case scenario, poached. However, without active tracking to confirm their actual status, none of these assumptions could be confirmed.



A few days later, after no sightings were recorded of the missing tigers, the Director of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve requested emergency assistance from the WITL team, to organize camera-trapping sessions in the Khandar Range of the Reserve. In response, an emergency eleven-day camera trapping session was scheduled towards the end of January and early February 2014. A team of three WWF-India field personnel, including one tiger biologist, and two field assistants were deployed to the area to help set up camera traps to locate the missing tigers.



Based on field data, the team identified ideal locations for setting up camera traps. After a total sampling effort of 110 trap nights, covering a total area of 69 km2, five individual tigers were captured and recaptured on the camera trap photographs, including three adult males, one adult female and one sub adult female, indicating that the tigers were safe.



These tigers included the most well known tigers of Ranthambore - Sultan and Machli, the latter of which is considered to be the most photographed tiger in the world. Several other carnivores including the caracal, striped hyena, ratel, leopard, sloth bear and jungle cat, were also spotted during the course of the camera trap monitoring.



Mr. Sudarshan Sharma, DCF, Ranthambore Tiger Reserve indicated that, “Monitoring the dispersal of tigers is essential and the aid provided by WWF- India was of great assistance in identifying our tigers and ensuring their security throughout their dispersal.”



The Khandar Range is considered to be highly suitable for the breeding of tigers and has recorded a high degree of tiger breeding in the past. In order to ensure the long-term survival of tigers in the region, the team recommended to the Forest Department that it is essential to maintain continuous camera trapping and monitoring activities and promote a safe and sustainable environment for tigers of Ranthambore. 



“We are monitoring tigers, co-predators and prey in the corridors and neighboring Protected Areas of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, in order to identify habitats for dispersing tigers. Under these activities, we are engaging in continuous camera trapping to secure the animal and understand its dispersal pattern. In addition, we also provide training to the frontline staff of the forest division to enhance their monitoring capacity," said Mr. Sunny Shah, Coordinator, WITL, WWF-India. 



WWF-India is actively pursuing the conservation of tigers in Ranthambore, through its Western India Tiger Landscape program and will continue to work with the Rajasthan Forest Department and local communities to ensure a safe and secure future for the wildlife of this region.
