“The treasure of our nation does not lie in its monetary resources, but in its natural resources - the land and rivers that flow through them. The Government of Uttar Pradesh is working to develop conservation plans for eight major rivers in the state,” said Shri Dharampal Singh, Minister for Irrigation, Irrigation (Karmik), Government of Uttar Pradesh during an event organized for the release of a WWF report on Environmental Flows for a Healthy Ramganga by WWF-India and its partners. 



The report release was part of a workshop organized by WWF-India and Lok Bharti which saw the participation of representatives from government organizations, academic institutions, civil society organisations, farmers and citizens from towns and cities across the state.



Outlining the vision of the state government towards ensuring water security, Shri Singh highlighted that the UP Irrigation and Water Resources Department will work towards providing water to all farmers right up to the farm level. To reduce the anthropogenic impacts on rivers, the government is developing guidelines to prevent encroachment alongside river banks. Shri Singh appreciated the efforts of the Ramganga Mitras for being the true mitra (friend) of our rivers by actively engaging in their protection and conservation.



WWF-India’s report on “Environmental Flows for a Healthy Ramganga” indicates that the Ramganga, a major tributary of the Ganga, is not able to meet E-flow requirements during the dry season (November to May) downstream of Hareoli Barrage through Moradabad, Bareilly, and Dabri. ‘Environmental Flows’ are defined as the flows required for the maintenance of the ecological integrity of rivers, their associated ecosystems, and the goods and services provided by them.



Based on the E-Flows assessment and trade-offs analysis, a set of short, medium and long-term actions required for restoring E-Flows have been presented in the report. Many of the recommendations presented in the report have come from a series of discussions at the local, district and state levels.



Mr. Sanjay Kumar, Relief Commissioner, Government of Uttar Pradesh and former DM, Moradabad, called for setting up a River Rejuvenation and Wetland Conservation Authority with an exclusive mandate for river and wetland conservation. “Wetlands play an important role in performing various ecosystem functions and it is time that we take timely measures for their conservation”, opined Shri Kumar.



Speaking of WWF-India’s journey on the conservation of rivers, Dr. Sejal Worah, Programme Director shared the approach involved in the assessment of E-flows assessments in the Upper Ganga and Ramganga river systems. “We realized that we need to shift the discourse beyond E-Flows assessment theory and therefore decided to try and demonstrate E-Flows implementation in the Karula, a small tributary of the Ramganga in Uttar Pradesh”, she said. This, she added, could become a model for Uttar Pradesh and the whole country.



Shri Vishwanath Khemka, President, Lok Bharti stated that history has taught us to keep our rivers free flowing (aviral) and clean (nirmal). While it is encouraging that the National Mission for Clean Ganga has included these concepts in their conservation plans, but we as citizens have to do our bit to see that our actions do not have a negative impact on our rivers. Shri Khemka urged citizens and youth groups to dedicate time and efforts in making river rejuvenation a mass movement.



Ramganga Mitras and representatives from community-based organisations also shared their experiences and endeavors towards river conservation across various districts of the state.
