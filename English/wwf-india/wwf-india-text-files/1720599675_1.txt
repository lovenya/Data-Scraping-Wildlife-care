The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is holding its triennial conference in Bangkok in Thailand from 3 to 14 March, 2013 to decide how to improve the world’s wildlife trade regime that has been in place for 40 years. Some 2,000 delegates representing 177 governments, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organizations and businesses are there to attend and discuss, among other things, 70 proposals for amending the rules for specific species. The 70 proposals submitted by 55 countries from across all regions of the world seek to improve the conservation and sustainable use of marine species (including several shark species) and timber species (including over a 100 species from Madagascar), the vicuña population of Ecuador, freshwater turtles, frogs, crocodiles, ornamental and medicinal plants and many other animals and plants. Proposals addressing elephants, white rhinoceros, and polar bears were also submitted.Governments will consider and accept, reject or adjust these proposals for amending the CITES Appendices at the Conference of the Parties. On the inaugural day of the conference on 3rd March, 2013, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has outlined the steps Thailand would take to address illegal ivory trade in the country, including amending national legislation and bring Thailand in line with international norms. Her remarks came during her opening address at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Bangkok. However, the Prime Minister gave no indication as to when the legislative changes would be brought into effect. “This is the first time we have heard such a clear message of intent from the Thai government on this subject”, said Steven Broad, TRAFFIC’s Executive Director"But now we need to hear specifically what will be done and when it will happen”.
