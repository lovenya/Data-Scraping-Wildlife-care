Assam government to adopt South Africa’s rhino DNA indexing system to curb poaching
In a bid to fight poaching more effectively, the state government of Assam is planning to adopt RhODIS, a rhino DNA indexing system developed in South Africa. The system is being successfully used in the African nation to investigate and prosecute offenders in rhino poaching cases. This tool compiles each individual rhino’s unique DNA profile in a ready to reference database that can be presented in a court of law, thereby proving that a seized horn was from a particular poached rhino.



Two experts from South Africa, Dr Cindy Harper, Director, Veterinary Genetic Laboratory of University of Pretoria, who originally developed the RhODIS tool and Mr Rod Potter, a professional wildlife investigator with South Africa’s National Wildlife Crime Intervention Unit and an international authority on wildlife crime demonstrated the technology at a recent workshop in Assam, organized under IRV 2020, the flagship programme for conservation of Assam’s rhinos, of which WWF-India is a partner. 



The workshop lasted three days, the first day or the inaugural was for the senior officials of the state of Assam from the government and non-government sector as well as media. The second day was for the senior level officials from the Police and Forest Department, senior veterinarians from the state veterinary services and College of Veterinary Sciences, scientists from the State Forensics Laboratory and academics. Participants were also present from Nepal and other parts of India including Dr S.P. Goyal from WII. The third day was mainly for the field level officers and was organized at Kaziranga National Park and was attended by frontline forest staff from Kaziranga, Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Manas National Park and other areas; police officers from the districts of Nagaon, Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Sonitpur as well as veterinary officers from the government and representatives from local NGOs. 



Attending the inaugural day of the workshop was the Environment and Forest Minister of Assam, Mr Rakibul Hussain as well as many officials from Assam’s Forest Department including the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden of Assam, Mr R. P. Agarwalla. 



The government of Assam intends to implement RhODIS soon in Assam with support from WWF-India. This will boost the efforts of authorities to effectively prosecute rhino poachers, who often are let go by the courts for lack of strong evidence.



“RhODIS can complement the on ground efforts of the forest department to fight rhino poaching. We hope that timely use of such technology will help us to get the courts to impose stringent punishment on poachers and thereby deter further poaching attempts,” said Mr Agarwalla.



An integral part of the implementation of RhODIS is a proper analysis of the crime scene and collection of samples as per standard protocols and procedures. Therefore, as part of the workshop, the South African experts also undertook a demonstration in Kaziranga National Park of RhODIS’s use as a crime scene investigation tool for forest department officials of Assam. Speaking about the utility of the workshop, Mr Vijoyananda Bhobora, Range Forest Officer, Panbari, Manas National Park said, “We learned many things on wild life crime and conviction process in the RhODIS workshop. This will be beneficial for the rhinos in Manas and if the protocols and necessary support are in place we will be able to implement it successfully.”



Dr Cindy Harper suggested that Assam should take the lead in Asia for implementing RhODIS by setting up a dedicated and adequately staffed laboratory within the state. She also suggested that collaborations and agreements should be put in place so that the seizure of rhino parts can be linked and traced to their origin so that it can help in effective prosecution and make the protection efforts for the rhinos more sound. 



The rhinos of Assam are facing increased poaching pressure with at least 16 rhinos already killed by poachers this year. The timely implementation of this tool will be a shot in the arm of efforts by the Assam Forest Department to fight poachers. “Assam’s rhinos are the pride of India. In spite of conservation success over the last few decades, which increased their population, the rhinos of Assam are currently facing a serious threat from increased levels of poaching and will need the concerted effort of all stakeholders to ensure their long term survival. As a step in that direction, we will provide all possible support from our side to the Assam government to ensure that RhODIS gets implemented soon in Assam”, said Mr Ravi Singh, CEO & Secretary General, WWF-India.
