Shri Saran said, “This is a first step towards developing a holistic strategy for conservation of Dolphins. We plan to continue this as an annual affair.” Mr. Kaushal Raj Sharma, District Magistrate Kanpur said, “Aquatic animals, including the Dolphins do not have a voice, hence it is even more important for us to become their voice and work for their conservation”.  Dr. Prashant Verma, Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), who is overseeing the Statewide campaign informed “Based on inputs from this survey 20 model Dolphin conservation villages will be developed along the Ganga and its tributaries”. Senior officials including Superintendent of Police Traffic and locals from Kanpur did an enthusiastic send-off to the team commencing for census. Shri Suresh Babu, Director Rivers, Wetlands & Water Policy said, “Ganga River Dolphins is an indicator of the river health and the survey will present a realistic picture of the status of species and habitats. It will help design a collaborative programme (government, researchers, communities and civil society) to conserve our National Aquatic Animal.”

 

Under the campaign 21 teams comprising forest officials, NGOs, researchers and local communities of the Ganga, Yamuna, Chambal, Ken, Betwa, Son, Sharda, Geruwa, Gahagra Gandak and Rapti. Uttar Pradesh is slated to become the first state to have conducted this census twice in a participatory manner using a unified methodology. This census will contribute to strengthening the data and information on dolphin population from across the distribution range of the species in the Uttar Pradesh state. Threats to species and its habitat will be identified and management strategy will be devised for ‘Critical habitats’ as conservation hotspots. The exercise will also help in building capacity for adopting effective data collection skills and monitoring by the participating teams.

 

Findings of the survey will be announced on October 9, 2015.
