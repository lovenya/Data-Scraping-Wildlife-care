South Asia has evolved as a crucial source of poaching for wildlife trafficking, as well as a transit hub for illegal wildlife trade, as it is a rich biodiverse region and a home to many iconic wildlife species. Many of these species may be seriously endangered or even be on the brink of extinction. Rampant poaching and unscrupulous illegal trade of wildlife for the sale of hides, trophies, ornamental plants, musical instruments and for traditional medicine, often in outside markets, adds pressure on wildlife. Traffickers exploit the porous borders of South Asia to smuggle wildlife products and timber within the region and beyond to other lucrative international destinations.
