WWF-India has been working in various key wildlife areas of Jammu & Kashmir for a long time. One of the major focus areas of this partnership is the wetlands of the state. WWF-India has also been working in some key landscapes of the state through site-specific conservation projects. Over the years, it was felt that both organizations needed to formalize this partnership which could benefit the biodiversity of the state on a long-term basis. For this, many discussions and meetings were held between both organizations and finally, after approval from the Government of Jammu & Kashmir, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Mr Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF-India and Mr A.

The MoU was signed on 28 December 2013 at the Wildlife Training Centre of the J & K Government located at Jasrota Wildlife Sanctuary. 



On this occasion Mr A. K. Singh said, “This is a historic occasion in the conservation history of the state and this MoU will go a long way in ensuring that the wildlife and their habitats in the state are protected through science-based conservation actions. The Government of Jammu & Kashmir has great hopes from this partnership and I am fully confident that this will deliver results on the ground in the near future”. 



Speaking on the occasion, Mr Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, “WWF-India has been working closely with the Wildlife Protection Department of the Jammu and Kashmir Government for many years and this has helped to implement various conservation projects in the state. This partnership has been documented through the signing of a memorandum of understanding which will further boost conservation initiatives in the state of Jammu & Kashmir which is bestowed with unique biodiversity”. He also announced the institution of a conservation award by WWF-India to be conferred on a staff member of the forest department every year for outstanding conservation contribution to the state of Jammu & Kashmir.



As part of this partnership, various joint projects will be planned and implemented in the state. WWF-India and the Department of Wildlife Protection, J&K Government will also jointly formulate a vision document for the wetlands of Jammu & Kashmir.
