Join WWF-India for a virtual musical night to celebrate ‘The Biggest Hour for Earth with Ricky Kej.'

 

New Delhi, 24th March 2023: Urging everyone to participate in large numbers, Ricky Kej, Face of Earth Hour India 2023, said, “Earth Hour 2023 aims to inculcate a sense of belongingness and ownership among people towards their planet and encourage cities to collectively shift towards sustainable development and citizens to reduce the growing environmental impact of our urban lifestyles. Adopting cycling as a way of commuting is a step in the direction of a sustainable way of living. I urge young and old people to participate in the Pedal for the Planet event and reiterate their support towards Earth Hour."

 

WWF-India is calling on individuals, communities, and businesses across the country to Give an Hour for Earth to create the Biggest Hour for Earth to celebrate this year’s Earth Hour, the world’s largest grassroots environmental campaign. Earth Hour witnesses millions of people worldwide every year celebrate the moment, serving as a powerful reminder of the importance of our planet and the need to protect it in the limited time available.

 

Pedal for the Planet is a WWF-India initiative that aims to raise awareness about Earth Hour and promote a healthier, greener and more sustainable lifestyle at an individual level. Hosting the event this year across 13 cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Trivandrum, Kochi, Guwahati, Bhopal, Kolkata, Valsad, Udaipur, Ladhak) will see extensive participation and people coming together to pledge for their planet. Pedal for the Planet will be conducted in partnership with HSBC, BYCS India Foundation and EPAM.

 

The virtual musical concert by Ricky Kej will be the highlight for on the night of Earth Hour (25th March from 8:30 pm onwards). Celebrating “The Biggest Hour for Earth with Ricky Kej” musical concert will showcase compositions by him in collaboration with international artists, highlighting the importance of nature in our lives and that we should reconnect with it and show our support and care. The event will be live-streamed on (25th March 2023 from 8:27 pm onwards) on Youtube and Facebook

 

Since 2007, Earth Hour has become the world's largest grassroots movement for the environment, bringing together individuals, communities, businesses, organizations and governments in 192 countries and territories around the world to stand together for our planet. Earth Hour seeks to inspire and remind people of the power we each have to positively impact our planet – our shared home. Celebration in Earth is about coming together of individuals to form a community focused on giving 60 minutes of our time to our planet.

 

Earth Hour every year tries to broaden its meaning, and this year too (25th March 2023), as landmarks and homes across the planet switch off, we want everyone to take a break from their routine and everyday distractions and spend 60 minutes doing something positive for our planet.



 

HSBC spokesperson said, “Sustainability is at the heart of what we do at HSBC. Our mission is to spread a message to convey the importance of making that switch for the environment – one pedal at a time. And it doesn’t stop there, because sustainability not just a mindset, but a way of life.  



We remain committed to our cause and responsibility towards Planet Earth and vow to continue on this quest towards a greener future. We want to do more than simply play our part in the transition to a more sustainable world. We have committed to become a net-zero bank, support our customers to transition to a low carbon future, accelerate new climate solutions, inspire our customers to invest to support positive change.”

 

Dr. Bhairrvi Joshi, BYCS India Foundation shares, “Our planet is facing a serious climate crisis. We are living in times where breathing air in the cities has become a threat to life. Every day we come in contact with so much of vehicular emission. It is imperative that we change our habits and our way of life in the cities. Cycling is one such habit that people should adopt. Cycling is not just a means of transportation, it is a means of transformation, be it of an individual, a city or a nation. Incorporating cycling in everyday life is a potential solution to the urban challenges of physical, mental and environmental health."

 

Shamilka Samarasinha, Global CSR Head, EPAM Systems shared, “We are honored to partner with WWF in our shared mission to protect our planet and promote environmental sustainability. The global environmental challenges we face today require collective action, and we encourage everyone to join us in taking meaningful steps towards a greener future. As we participate in the Biggest Hour for Earth, let's make a commitment to adopting sustainable practices in our daily lives, such as reducing plastic consumption, conserving water and energy, and supporting conservation efforts. Together, we can make a significant impact and safeguard our planet for generations to come.”
