Reports received from over 100 Indian cities and towns
In 2009, 56 cities and towns had participated in the event

New Delhi: Hundreds of thousands of Indians joined millions globally as the clock struck 8.30 pm,on 27th March,2010 . India Gate, one of nation’s historical landmarks turned dark exactly at 8:30 pm when the Chief Minister of Delhi Smt Sheila Dixit turned off a switch, at an event held at India Gate lawns. From Ladakh to Thiruvanthapuram to Mumbai to Gangtok several cities and towns also switched off their lights in support.



The iconic Gateway of India in Mumbai also dimmed lights for Earth Hour. So did well known landmarks like Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Bandra Worli Sea Link in Mumbai, Victoria Memorial in Kolkata and Husain Sagar in Hyderabad.



Starting with Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru as the official Earth Hour cities, this year WWF-India went on to bring on board Chennai, Raipur, Shimla as the other three official cities with State Chief Ministers endorsing the campaign and executing switch offs in their respective states. As reports are coming in more than 100 Indian cities and towns have confirmed Earth Hour celebrations. 



Earth Hour is an event meant to inspire people to take individual action on one of the most pressing environmental problems of our time-climate change. WWF believes that Climate change is a concern for all of us. Solutions are within our abilities and can be implemented by individuals, communities, businesses and governments around the globe. Earth Hour gives us the ability to reflect on the fragility and importance of our natural heritage and pledge to protect it for a sustainable future. It is not just about conserving energy but about creating long term awareness towards responsible use of renewable and other resources and to bring about a change towards adoption of an environment friendly lifestyle.



Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India thanked supporters across the country for their overwhelming support yet again this year and said that, “it was heartening that the campaign has received support from all sections of society all across the country.’’ He added, ”Earth Hour has become a campaign that binds those who care for this planet. We are also thankful to Abhishek Bachchan for his support and commitment towards this noble cause ’’.
