WWF-India’s Darjeeling team loses a conservationist



With deep pain WWF-India shares the news of the passing away of Mr. Narendra Tamang a member of WWF-India’s team at Darjeeling on Saturday, 30 Oct 2010. Mr. Tamang had a cerebral stroke followed by a cardiac arrest. He was supposed to drive back the team from the field to Darjeeling but had to be taken to the hospital instead. The team is shocked as Mr.Tamang had an Army background and looked fit and healthy. WWF-India conveys its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family, praying for the peace of the departed soul. 



A dedicated soldier of conservation

Says Sanjeeb Pradhan, Senior Project Officer, based at Darjeeling “He was a brave soldier of the Indian Army who served in many parts of India and joined us as a driver cum Field Assistant in December 2009. I can remember him not just as one of our staff but also as a guardian and a family member. The team members felt his presence the moment they entered the Darjeeling field office. He was always the first one to reach our office and would welcome the rest with a warm smile and a glass of water. Even while driving us into the field he would assure us of our safety every time”. His words sum up the mood in rest of the organisation “We salute you Narenda and may your soul rest in peace”. A salute to Mr. Narendra Tamang, a conservation foot soldier
