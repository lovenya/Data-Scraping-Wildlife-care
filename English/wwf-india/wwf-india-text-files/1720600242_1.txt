There is a baby boom in Manas National Park, Assam. A decade after the launch of an incredibly challenging project -- called Indian Rhino Vision (IRV) 2020 -- to save the endangered greater one-horned rhinoceros(Rhinoceros unicornis) through wild-to-wild translocation, the birth and survival of 13 new calves (since 2012) has pushed the population of the animal to 32, bringing hope for their future.

 

In 2012, the news of the first rhino birth to Rhino 10, an adult cow translocated from Pobitara, had brought much cheer to the IRV 2020 team working in the park. Since then, the rhino population has been on a gradual rise. On 1 August 2015, the newest baby in the park was born to Mainao (meaning ‘loveable’ in Assamese), a rhino rescued under the Assam government’s rhino rehabilitation programme and rehabilitated in Manas. Mainao had delivered another calf -- a male –on 2 June 2013. Yet another rehabilitated rhino, Ganga, released in Manas in 2006, bore a calf on 18 June 2015. She too was a second time mother, with her first calf born only in April 2013.

 

These new births were at once surprising and heartening because with a gestation period of about 26 months, it’s unusual for rhino cows to bear calves twice in such close succession. In both the instances, the likely father of the calves was a wild male rhino translocated under IRV2020. Clearly, in the face of immense threats due to poaching, habitat loss and other causes, the rhinos were accepting Manas as their home and feeling safe enough to produce offspring.

 

Wild-to-wild translocation: Why and when 

Rhinos were once common in Manas, but were exterminated in the 1990s when Assam went through a long period of social unrest and insurgency. At the turn of the century, the overall population of the animal in Assam had turned abysmal, with only 46 left in Orang National Park, and none in Manas. This was cause for serious concern, considering that Assam houses one of the largest populations of the greater one-horned rhino found in India.

 

Hence, in 2005, the Assam Forest Department in partnership with WWF-India, International Rhino Foundation and US Fish & Wildlife Service launched IRV 2020, a programme aimed at increasing the number and range of the rhino in Assam through wild-to-wild translocations from Kaziranga National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary to other potential Protected Areas (PAs) including Manas, Burachapori WLS, Laokhowa WLS, Dibru-Saikhowa NP.  The vision was to attain a population of 3000 wild rhinos in Assam, distributed over seven of its PAs by 2020.



At the launch of IRV 2020, 1855 rhinos were recorded from Kaziranga and 81 from Pobitora.Between April 2008 and March 2012, 18 were translocated to Manas -- 8 from Kaziranga and 10 from Pobitora.



Ever since, this programme has experienced several highs and lows. While the lows, in form of relentless poaching and habitat degradation persists, success is beginning to show, especially in Manas, through the slowly but surely rising numbers of the pachyderm population in the park. From zero in 1999 to 5 in 2009, Manas today has 32 wild rhinos within its boundary.



Despite success, a battle against poaching 

Unfortunately, despite the overall success of the IRV 2020 translocation programme, poaching -- one of the biggest threats in Manas –has continued relentlessly. In the last decade, even as several births brought cheer, eight rhinos were reportedly poached in the park. The most recent and tragic death was that of Rhino 5, the likely father to Mainao’s and Ganga’s newest calves.



Since the past five years, efforts are on to improve protection and monitor source and target PAs in Assam: the forest department has even thwarted two poaching attempts in the Basbari Range of the park recently. However, persisting unrest in the region makes protection efforts extremely difficult.



Way forward

Now, after assessing and acknowledging the substantial success of the translocation to Manas, the second phase of translocation under IRV 2020 will begin in Assam in around November-December 2015, with the translocation of at least 4 rhinos to the Laokhowa-Burachapori Sanctuary complex. Constant efforts are also on, to strengthen the protection and monitoring staff in the PAs, to reduce threats such as poaching and habitat loss. With regular capacity building exercise to strengthen the forest staff, as well as empowering and building relationship with the local community, WWF-India along with its partners hopes that the vision of 3000 rhinos populatingAssam’s PAs by 2020, would become a reality.
