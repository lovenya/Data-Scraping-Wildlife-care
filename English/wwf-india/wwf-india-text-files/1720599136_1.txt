Gangtok, Sikkim: WWF-India, Ecotourism and Conservation Society of Sikkim (ECOSS) and Khanchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) jointly organised a two-day training workshop on ‘Practising Responsible Tourism’ on June 11-12, 2011 in Gangtok, Sikkim. It was attended by senior officers from the Tourism and Forest Department, tour operators, hotel owners and other service providers from the tourism industry, NGOs, CBOs, and students from Sikkim and Arunachal. 



The workshop was part of WWF’s Green Hiker campaign which is in turn, a WWF initiative to conserve the Himalayan high altitude wetlands, founded under its 'Saving Wetlands Sky-High! programme. The campaign is already running successfully in India in the five Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.



Targeted primarily at tourism service providers, the workshop enabled an analysis and discussion on the current tourism scenario and trends in Sikkim, the urgent need for responsible tourism, successful case studies of community-based and home stays from Arunachal Pradesh, Makaibari, Mayal lyang (Dzongu) and more. Strong emphasis was placed on the need for setting standards and guidelines for home stays, in consultation and agreement with the local communities and the right kind of marketing, to regulate the kind of tourists they receive.



Speaking at the event, the Joint Secretary, Department of Tourism, Government of Sikkim said “Responsible tourism is a major part of our tourism mission. We have been given recommendations for responsible tourism. Our government is seriously considering the particular recommendation of founding a day called the ‘Great Sikkim Clean up’ perhaps on Earth Day, on which the whole Sikkim would come together for cleaning up. We’re trying to build a consensus in the government to implement this recommendation. I hope all participants learn from this workshop,” he added.



According the PCCF and Secretary, Forest Department, “The FEWMD has started many projects in the ‘ecotourism’ direction, one of which is ready to implement a number of activities to strengthen the ecotourism services, creating links between tour operators and local communities offering tourism services, improving solid waste management at ecotourism sites and more.”



“Tourism has become an important source of economy for Sikkim. However, it has exceeded its carrying capacity and there is no aggregated data on the kind of tourist inflow. There has to be strong coordination and convergence between the Forest and Tourism departments. What we need for responsible tourism more than development is the capacity building in our people,” stated Mr. P.D. Rai, Member of Parliament, summing up the first day of the workshop.
