As part of the global Earth Hour City Challenge (EHCC) and the associated people’s choice campaign called the We Love Cities (WLC), Green Energy Fairs were held at two of the finalist cities of the challenge – Rajkot and Pune. The fairs were jointly organized by the respective Municipal Corporations, WWF-India and ICLEI-South Asia.



Pune held its fair at Sambhaji Udyan on 4 March and the Rajkot Green Energy Fair was held on 9 February 2015 at the Rajkot Energy Park.



Apart from bringing people together to know, explore and learn more about renewable energy, the fairs celebrate the selection of Pune and Rajkot as the Earth Hour City Challenge (EHCC) finalists from India. The Green Energy Fairs aimed at creating awareness on the various green solutions that are available in the cities and promoting simple and practical renewable energy solutions that individuals and institutions could adopt to shift to a greener lifestyle. Various renewable energy manufacturers participated at the fairs and displayed practical and easy-to-use products such as solar panels, solar water heaters, solar lighting systems, solar cookers, etc.



Competitions were held for school students in both the cities on the theme, “My Dream City”. While Rajkot held painting and essay-writing competitions, a greeting card making competition was held at Pune. The competitions saw some very interesting and creative entries by students. The winners were awarded by senior officials of the cities.



The Green Energy Fairs were organized as part of the global Earth Hour City Challenge, where Pune and Rajkot have emerged among the 44 global finalist cities.  Rajkot’s aggressive low carbon targets towards 2016 and Pune’s strong commitment to low carbon and sustainable initiatives such as its Eco-Housing programme for green building have been the key deciding criteria for their selection as finalists. Their traffic management solutions such as BRTs have also contributed to their list of sustainable achievements.



The two cities are also running contenders for the We Love Cities Campaign where people from across the globe are voting for their favourite city from among the EHCC finalists. People can simply visit www.welovecities.org to cast their vote. One can click on vote and share what they love most about the cities. They can also share any suggestions that they might have to improve their cities. Other significant ways to increase the interactions for Pune & Rajkot are by using the hashtag #WeLovePune and #WeLoveRajkot on social media; one can post, follow, tag, tweet and also instagram the city photos. Each time people vote, tweet, instagram and/or share their suggestions, Pune and Rajkot come a step closer to becoming the world’s most loved city. Celebrating cities through Green Energy Fairs
