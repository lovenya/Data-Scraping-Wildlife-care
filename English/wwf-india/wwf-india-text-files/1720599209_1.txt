Celebrating the Wildlife Week, WWF-India organized a Nature Walk at Green Canopy, Interpretation Centre in association with the Delhi Government and India Habitat Centre



New Delhi: Celebrating the Wildlife Week, WWF-India organized a “Nature Walk for Bats” in partnership with the Delhi Government and India Habitat Centre today. The trail was organized for students from different schools of Delhi at Green Canopy, Interpretation Centre situated at the Delhi Chief Minister’s Residence (3, Motilal Nehru Marg, New Delhi). The aim of the nature trail was to provide an opportunity to the students to enjoy the scenic beauty of the lush green spaces of the Chief Minister’s residence where they learnt about some exotic and indigenous trees like Bottle Brush Tree, Giant Lemon Tree, Jamun, Dhak, Fish-tail Palm, etc. and the bats, birds, reptiles and small mammals that these trees provide a habitat to. 

 

Dr. B. C. Sabata (Sr. Scientific Officer, Dept. of Environment, Government of N.C.T. of Delhi), Mr. Rakesh Khatri and Animesh Kapoor (Resource persons, Green Canopy) facilitated the ‘Nature Walk for Bats’ where the students also witnessed other faunal and floral diversity apart from witnessing many bats hanging from various trees around the bungalow. There are around 2000 fruit bats present in the vicinity of the campus. 



Bird watching techniques were explained to them with the help of an information board placed at the site. Students were able to spot some birds like the Rufous tree-pie, bulbuls, common myna, laughing dove, grey dove, koels and peafowls (seen flying). They were also given information on the aquatic ecosystem with reference to the fresh pink water lily pond in the vicinity. The importance of butterflies and their life-cycle was explained along with the plant interaction in the forest ecosystem. A movie on wildlife was screened for the students in the activity centre. The trail ended with a game ‘Guess your Animal’ where the students had to identify a particular animal on the basis of certain clues provided to them.



Through such trails, WWF aims to sensitize and inculcate a sense of responsibility amongst the urban youth towards conserving the urban habitats, thereby depicting the importance of forests that we depend on and demonstrate how different species live in close harmony with each other and interact with the environment.
