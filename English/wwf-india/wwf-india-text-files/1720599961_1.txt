Uttarakhand Forest Minister releases report at a special event in NainitalThe Kosi River Corridor stretches across the Nainital and Almora districts of Uttarakhand and represents a vital passage for tigers, elephants and other animals that inhabit Corbett Tiger Reserve. The corridor provides connectivity between the Corbett Reserve and the surrounding forest regions in the Ramnagar Forest Division (FD). 



At a special event held at the Nainital Zoo, Hon. Forest Minister of Uttarakhand, Mr Dinesh Aggarwal released several awareness materials concerning the corridor. These included a special report on the state of thecorridor, an awareness sticker entitled ‘Lifeline for Terai Tigers – Kosi River Corridor’ and a brochure on the ‘Promotion of Alternative Energy in Terai Arc Landscape’. The event was attended by several distinguished guests including Mr Paramjeet Singh, Chief Conservator of Forests (Kumaun Zone), Mr Vivek Pandey, CF South Kumaun, Mr Surender Mehra, CF Western Circle, Mr Prem Kumar, CF North Kumaun, and several other forest officials of the Kumaun region.



WWF-India’s Dr Harish Guleria, Head, Terai Arc Landscape (TAL)-Uttarakhand, also made a presentation that outlined and discussed the conservation significance of the Kosi River Corridor. Several camera trap captures were displayed at the presentation, which provided a rare insight into the movement of tigers in this region. A total of 13 tigers had beencaptured by camera traps in the corridor areas, out of which, two male tigers were seen to be using the northern and the southern portions of the corridor frequently.



In addition to tigers, the camera trapping exercises also recorded 21 species of wild mammals. Six the 21 mammal species photo-captured were of high global conservation significance. Thus, in addition to the connectivity provided to tigers, the conservation significance of these species elevates the ecological importance of the corridor tremendously.



The northern section of the corridor is contiguous with the upper hills of the Almora FD, and five species with Himalayan affinity are also known to occur here, of which, the red fox was recorded by the present study. The capture of the red fox had additional significance, as it represented the first time that this species was spotted at such low altitudes (505 m above mean sea level) – both in TAL, as well as in India.

 

Mr Paramjeet Singh, Chief Conservator of Forests (Kumaun) remarked that: “The forests of the Western Circle possess a very healthy population of tigers and other wildlife species, specifically in the Ramnagar Forest Division and Nandhour Wildlife Sanctuary.”



The Honourable Forest Minister expressed his concerns regarding the sustainability of the corridor and committed to strengthen protection for tiger and wildlife in these areas. He also encouraged those present to work towards better coordination with the local communities adjoining these regions in an effort to minimize human wildlife conflict.
