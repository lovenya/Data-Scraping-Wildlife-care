There are recent media reports suggesting that Dr. Shashirekha Sureshkumar, an expert nominated by WWF India to the Tree Authority of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), has agreed to the cutting down of trees for the Aarey Metro-3 Car Shed.



Dr. Sureshkumar has clearly indicated, through a written communication to WWF India, that she opposes the cutting of trees and the same has been mentioned in a report submitted to the Municipal Secretary, MCGM Mumbai on 13 August 2019, in which she is a signatory.



WWF India does not support the decision of cutting down of trees in the Mumbai Aarey Colony. The statement allegedly made by Dr. Sureshkumar, as reported by the media, is not endorsed by WWF India in any form.
