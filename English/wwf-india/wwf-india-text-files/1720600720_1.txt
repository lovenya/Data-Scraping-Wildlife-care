It was the time of our Half Yearly exams at Delhi Public School Guwahati and I will never forget the pressutre! Yet, I studied for the Wild Wisdom Quiz instead till 12:00 midnight. Despite the tiredness and the lack of sleep, the sheer desire and the compulsion to win gave me a lot more patience. Finally, when the exams were over and our durga puja celebrations started, I enjoyed myself to the fullest for some days. After the puja was over, my partner, Adhiraj Kar of class VI (now in class VII), and I started vigorous studying together.



Studying for the quiz was the best time of our lives! Both of us are very interested in the secrets of wildlife and nature, and this was our opportunity to unravel these! 



 Then the day arrived when we left for Delhi. I was extremely nervous on the day of the quiz. But when I saw the prizes, I made up my mind that I had to win! We also learnt about the ‘One Planet Academy’ a web portal where we can get to know many things about wildlife and nature through exciting games and fun activities. We got a bit tensed when our names were not called in the first five teams but it was announced in the sixth place, after which we had a tie breaker round with three other teams. We gave the answer to the tie-breaker question and were selected for the main round. We were at the third position throughout the quiz but we finally won it.



For someone who had only expected to cross the elimination, having the Quiz man of India Mr. Siddharth Basu announce my name as the winner was an absolute pleasure! When we won the quiz, I was in Seventh Heaven. It was a great feeling, a sense of having done something great. As winners, we got a chance to go to ‘Camp Hornbill’ in Uttarakhand. The adventure activities there were so thrilling! We woke up very early in the morning, and started for Camp Hornbill in Ramnagar, Uttarakhand.



The first night, we stayed in tents. Then the next day we stayed in mud houses which were cooler than the tents in the afternoon and warmer in the early morning as well as late night when it is chilly. We also saw many different species of birds. We also had fun in the water on the second day. We had a Lipai activity where we had to coat a floor with a mixture of cowdung, mud and hay. The women from the Kyari village came to show us how it is done. We were a bit sloppy with the cowdung mix but we learnt it slowly. We also saw people’s daily lives. It was quite fascinating how they lived amidst the beauty of nature but without harming it.



We also heard of a tiger being spotted in the crop fields from the locals. We had always studied about wildlife and nature theoretically in books or on the Internet, but this time we got to experience it. The mesmerising views of the Khichadi River and its scenic river banks, the avifauna, the animal pug marks and the cool camp chaupal. These days were very exciting and full of happiness which I will never forget in my entire life. I have been with Wild Wisdom Quiz by WWF-India for three years, since I was studying in class 5. This journey was full of excitement and a lot of learning. By yet, I don’t even feel that I know even 10% of what there is to learn, but I do feel that I am somewhat like a conservationist, and for this I thank the entire WWF-India team, particularly Archita Baruah ma’am who supported us a lit.



These memories will forever remain in my heart to cherish for my entire life. Most importantly, I have got to learn that we humans belong to the Earth, the Earth doesn’t belong to us. An Achievement to Cherish Forever
