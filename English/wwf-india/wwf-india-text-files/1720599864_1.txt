WWF-India organizes Ramganga boat-ride to examine key threats
Moradabad: WWF-India in partnership with the District Administration of Mordabad conducted a boat survey to understand the existing key threats, biodiversity status and dependency of local community members on Ramganga river. The survey saw the participation of senior government officials of the city of Moradabad, including Mr Praveen Mishr (ADM City), Mr Shailendra Kumar Singh (Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Sadar) and Assistant Scientific Office of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Mr U.C. Shukla. 



The purpose of the survey was to take immediate steps to revive the river as part of the conservation strategy initiated by WWF-India and District Administration of Moradabad, untaken at the behest of the District Magistrate of Moradabad in conjunction with WWF-India. The boat ride began upstream of the Ramganga, commencing from Vivekanand hospital drain and culminating at Katghar Railway Bridge. The surveyors witnessed various key threats to Ramganga including key drains, Moksha Dhaam Naala, M.I.T drain, T.D.I city drain, Jhabbo ka Naala drain, which carry the city’s sewage to the river. Other critical factors which include riverbed farming, bundh formation on river banks, pollution load brought in by Dhela river, sand mining, e-waste furnaces and washing of brass were discussed in detail.



The participants believed that synergized and collaborative efforts are required for the restoration of the Ramganga. “Secondary information can never match up to first-hand information about our Ramganga river. Being part of this survey has been an eye-opener, especially with regard to the threats the river faces. The decisions that need to be taken on sand-mining, e-waste washing and river cultivation should be taken in an integrated fashion and accordingly a plan of action should be found to ensure its long-term sustainability. I also strongly feel that we should encourage stakeholders to talk about conservation at designated platforms to places like the Ramganga Choupal,” said Mishr, while emphasizing the importance of Ramganga Mitra initiative. 



SDM, Sadar, Shailendra Kumar Singh said that combined effort from all stakeholders including the government, industrialists, farmers is key to the revival of the Ramganga. He also appreciated the work done by WWF by adding that Ramganga Mitras also play a vital role in the revival of the river.
