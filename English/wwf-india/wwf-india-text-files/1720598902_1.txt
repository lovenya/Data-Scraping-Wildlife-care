Underpasses help elephants cross National highway near Manas Tiger Reserve

India’s National Highway 152 connects Pathsala town of Assam with neighbouring Bhutan. For about 35km this highway runs parallel to the Manas National Park's (NP) eastern boundary and cuts through Daodhora Reserve Forest (RF) - a buffer of the Manas Tiger Reserve (TR). It has been found that a 4-km stretch of this road is more frequented by elephants than rest of the highway. To facilitate their free movement across this road, the highway was elevated at two locations and underpasses were built, which opened for traffic in May 2010. These underpasses are helping these gentle giants move freely across the forest without the fear of vehicles.



Underpass for elephants

This underpass project is the idea of Assam Government. Based on requests for constructing underpasses which were sent by some State Government officials, the Ministry of Surface Transport readily accepted the innovative suggestion. Mr. A. Swargowary, the then Nodal Officer and currently Field Director, Manas TR, verified the proposal and Mr. M. C. Malakar, then Chief Wildlife Warden, Assam worked for its approval.  



 A survey to re-align the road was done with the help of local youth. The entire stretch of this road inside the Tiger Reserve was realigned to minimise the disturbance to the park’s wildlife and a diversion was made for it to pass through the adjoining Reserve Forest. The NGO Manas Maozigendri Eco-tourism Society (MMES) supported these efforts. The newly aligned road along with the underpasses was thrown open to traffic in May 2010. Both the underpasses are 30 feet tall with a width of about 165 feet. Each of these is divided into two parts by a supporting column.



Present scenario

On 25 August 2010, a team comprising of officials from the Assam Forest Department including Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Deputy Director of Manas NP and Range Officer of Bhuyapara wildlife range apart from members of WWF-India’s North Bank Landscape (NBL) team visited some parts of Bhuyapara range in the eastern part of Manas NP as well as the newly aligned road and the underpasses. They found that elephants were using the underpasses. According to Amit Sharma, Coordinator of WWF-India’s Rhino Conservation efforts, locals from nearby villages also vouched for this. Mr. Sokiram of the nearby Dakhin Khamardwisa village along with his friends witnessed the passage of a small herd of elephants through one of these underpasses on the evening of 9 July, 2010. Other locals also say that these are often used by small herds of elephants residing in the nearby forests. “This has been confirmed by Mr. Birkhang Goyari, a Co-ordinator of MMES” says Amit. 



He adds “Similar designs can be adopted for other forest roads that harbour elephants based on this case.” He adds, “Although there are indications of elephants using this underpass, we believe some green cover has been disturbed during the construction. This needs to be restored through human intervention. This will aid more intensive use of the underpasses by wildlife, including the small animals apart from elephants and tigers”.
