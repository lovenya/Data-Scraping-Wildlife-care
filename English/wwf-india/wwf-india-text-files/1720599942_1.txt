Highlights of the celebrations from across WWF-India's landscapes
The occasion of World Environment Day (WED) was established by the United Nations General Assembly, and is celebrated annually on June 5. This year, the theme for World Environment Day was ‘climate change’. Teams across WWF-India's landscapes in the country conducted various WED events, comprising environmentally-themed workshops and activities in their respective regions, to help promote this cause in the context of local conservation and environmental issues.



In the Terai Arc Landscape (TAL), two events were held – one at the Corbett Wildlife Training Centre, Kalagarh, Uttarakhand and another at the Amangarh range of Bijnor Forest Division, Uttar Pradesh. The events were attended by a total of 130 people comprising students, teachers, forest department staff, researchers, as well as members of the local community. Art competitions and debates were organized for students, and a clean-up drive was organized wherein polythene waste from outside the Corbett WildlifeTraining Centre was collected for appropriate recycling or disposal. The event was featured on the television channel ETV in Uttar Pradesh.



In the Kaziranga Karbi Anglong Landscape (KKL), WED events were organized at two locations in the Kaliabor Sub-Division, Nagaon, which are located on the fringe of Kaziranga National Park. These regions have witnessed an increase in human-elephant conflict (HEC) in recent years. The event in the Kaliabor area was conducted at Pashim Pub-tharia High School in collaboration with the Assam Science Society, Kaliabor and the Kaliabor Press Club. Seven hundred students from across 17 schools participated in tree plantation, art, quiz and poster competitions. Following the event, saplings were distributed to students, teachers and parents. This programme was unique as it was the first time an awareness programme on conservation was in partnership with the media. This event also served to unite media groups in Kaliabor and Bokakhat sub-divisionson the fringe of Kaziranga, for a common cause.



Another series of KKL events was also organized in the 6th Addition of Kaziranga National Park in the form of a day-long awareness programme and awareness rally. The event was focused on the conservation of the greater one-horned rhinoceros and Asian elephant, along with other local conservation issues. The event culminated in the form of a unique awareness rally wherein a specially constructed statue of a greater one-horned rhinocerous was fashioned into a vehicle, which led the rally. 



In the Khangchendzonga Landscape (KCL), a painting and slogan contest on a local theme of ‘A Litter Free Sikkim’ was organized for students of Gangtok schools by the Tsomgo Pokhri Sanrakshan Samiti, in collaboration with the state Forest Department and WWF-India. Sixty students from 18 schools participated in the contest. The Tsomgo Lake receives over 3,00,000 tourists annually, and has suffered from issues related to improper and mismanaged garbage disposal, thereby affecting the lake and its associated eco-systems, ultimately contributing to its degradation. Students were encouraged to come up with art-work that would help sensitize tourists to these environmental issues.



In addition to the Tsomgo Lake activities, a three-day nature camp was organized in Lachen village inNorth Sikkim. The nature camp was organized by WWF-India in collaboration with the Lachen Tourism Development Committee. Fifty-one students from three schools from Lachen and Chungthang participated in the camp which kicked off on World Environment Day, and was completed on June 8. The camp consisted of numerous games andfield trips split up across three days, designed to raise awareness and sensitivity towards local environmental issues, flora and fauna.



In the Western India Tiger Landscape (WITL), the occasion was celebrated jointly with the Ranthambhore School of Art and Wildlife Conservation Society at Adarsh Girls Vidya Mandir, located in Sawai Madhopur City. The event was attended by 130 students from the city's schools. The event featured environmentally themed drawing, painting slogan and quiz competitions that encouraged students to use their creativity to promote conservation and an environmentally conscious lifestyle. In addition, an environmental film show was also organized for the students to help raise awareness on relevant contemporary environmental issues.



The Western Arunachal Landscape conservation programmeconducted a series of biodiversity orientation programmes with the Indian Army in Lumpo, Zemithang Valley. During the orientation programmes, the participantswere introduced to monitoring handbooks on biodiversity and a wildlife monitoring mechanism was outlined on the biodiversity of Zemithang Valley and the importance of its conservation. The orientation programme was encouraged and deeply supported by Col Mohit Thapa.



Col Thapa, during his speech to all the participants said,“I believe this orientation programme will help our cadres to understand nature and its benefits.We will be more than happy to contribute to the effort of conserving ournation’s biodiversity in whatever way it is possible.”



WWF-India has used the occasion of World Environment Day, across all these landscapes, to promote an environmentally-conscious lifestyle so that local support can be built for the conservation of the rich biodiversity such landscapes are home to.
