Narora, UP:  WWF-India’s Narora Field team along with the state Forest department has rescued a Ganges River Dolphin three Kilometers downstream of Narora barrage, district Bulandsahar, UP and put it in the safe habitat, that is, upstream the Narora Barrage on 25th of September, 2009. River dolphins have been declared highly endangered by ICUN and Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act (1972), Government of India.



Two river dolphins where reported to be sighted by the local fishermen 3-4 Km downstream of Narora barrage on 22nd of September, 2009. The 165 kilometer stretch of river Ganges between Brijghat to Narora is a Ramsar site and an excellent habitat for Ganges dolphins and many other aquatic fauna. While one river dolphin was rescued, search is on for the other. 



The recent census by WWF-India team estimated that there are 53 dolphins in this stretch of the Ganges, which is more than doubled since 1996 when WWF-India initiated this project. 



WWF-India is carrying out various conservation activities including awareness campaigns regarding these species amongst the local villagers and fishermen. Locals and fishermen now empathize with the cause of WWF-India swiftly report the entanglement of these animals in the danger area where the water level is much less and there is a lot of anthropogenic pressure.
