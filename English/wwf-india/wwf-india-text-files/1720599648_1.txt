Indo-Nepal border being porous and well connected with land routes provides a lucrative bed for illegal wildlife traders to smuggle illegal wildlife products. Any national border being the first entry point and last exit point is an important checkpoint to control any contraband smuggling.



TRAFFIC India in association with SSB (Sashastra Seema Bal) organized a two day workshop on “Strengthening Wildlife Law Enforcement and Conservation along Indo Nepal Border” at Bagaha, Bihar on 16-17 January 2012.This workshop was seventh in series organized jointly by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and TRAFFIC.

During the two days, participants were taken through various domestic and international trends in prevailing illegal wildlife trade, laws pertaining to this trade, role of CITES in regulating wildlife trade, latest tools and techniques available to fight wildlife crime, significance of intelligence sharing, and an overview of global organized wildlife crime. 



Inaugurating the workshop, Mr. Singh said that such training workshops will help the SSB personnel and other participants in understanding the problems and will enhance their knowledge and skills.
