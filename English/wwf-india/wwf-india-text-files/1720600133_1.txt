Several hundred villages depend on the reserve for their basic needs

WWF-India and the Forest Department, Government of Bihar, organised a free health camp for two remote villages on the fringes of Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar.
Protecting tigers in a forest goes hand-in-hand with protecting people in the forest. This holds particularly true in Bihar’s Valmiki Tiger Reserve (Eastern Terai) -- where about 250 villages are concentrated within a 2 km radius from the reserve.  In this regard, WWF-India is working with the Bihar state Forest Department to meet the basic health and livelihood needs of forest-dependent villages where poverty is high, literacy is low and the fight for resources is intense.



In one such initiative, WWF-India and the Forest Department organized a free two-day health camp in the remote villages of Madanpur and Batsara in the West Champaran district of the reserve, in the last week of January. Doctors examined and helped treat 676 men, women and children who attended the camp, and WWF-India covered all costs for prescription medication dispensed during the two days. The villages were among five selected by WWF-India to address conservation concerns resulting from high anthropogenic pressure in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve. 



The aim of the health camp was to educate villagers on personal sanitation, ascertain general health concerns and identify common illnesses, and to provide treatment based on clinical evaluation. The most widespread complaints were weakness, skin infections, fevers, respiratory, gastric and orthopaedic issues.



The need for medical camps in villages next to forest areas in the state of Bihar cannot be emphasized enough. About half the population in Madanpur and Batsara are below the poverty line. And with literacy rates hovering under 10 percent, the village folk have little to no awareness about personal healthcare and sanitation. Toilets are a distant reality, and open defecation in the forest is practised by the vast majority. The nearest health clinics—in Bagha, Ramnagar, and Valmikinagar— are 16-30 km away. An ailing or sick patient would have to trek this distance on a bicycle or bullock-cart first down a kuchha road, and then on a highway, to reach the nearest clinic. The result speaks for itself in high mortality rates in these villages: the 2011 Annual Health Survey of the West Champaran District of Bihar revealed a neonatal mortality of 34-37, infant mortality of 53-57, and female mortality of 57-60. 



Their remoteness and meagre living conditions force the village communities to look to the forest for their most basic needs like fodder, fuelwood, and thatch. This brings them into direct contact and conflict with wild animals, and on occasion, the Forest Department. With increasing tiger monitoring and conservation, villagers find themselves deprived and forsaken by enforcement agencies. Conservation, hence, begins by gaining their trust, and helping improve their welfare.



Dr. Mudit Gupta, coordinator Terai Arc Landscape (East) said, "We hope to reduce the negativity between the villages and the Forest Department through community-welfare exercises like medical camps, and look forward to gaining the cooperation of the villagers in conservation."
