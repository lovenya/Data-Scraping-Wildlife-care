Disaster Management Department, Government of West Bengal organized International Workshop in association with WWF-India, EnGIO and World Bank on risk management & adaptation to climate change for sustainable growth in deltaic regions on 28-30 January 2015.



The Disaster Management Department, Government of West Bengal organized a three-day international workshop from 28 January 2015 on risk management and adaptation to climatic changes in deltaic regions with special focus on the Sundarbans.



The workshop was jointly organized by WWF-India, EnGIO and the World Bank to create improved knowledge systems to aid sustainable development in the Sundarbans. This workshop was one of the pioneering initiatives in a country where climate change considerations are rarely a facet while planning for disaster mitigation despite being severely affected by climatic changes. The Sundarbans, a world heritage site, is internationally recognized as a global climatic hotspot, and according to the recent report brought out by the Intergovermental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), the expected climatic impacts in the Sundarbans is likely to make Kolkata the most vulnerable city in Asia by 2070. The region’s climatic vulnerability primarily stems from the rise in sea level- which is twice the global average sea level rise- as well as the increasing frequency of high intensity cyclones generated in the Bay of Bengal.



"West Bengal is one of the most seriously impacted states in the country and the effects of climate change pose a great threat in our coastal areas, especially in the entire Sundarbans. The devastation that Cyclone Aila brought to the entire area in 2009 is still fresh in our minds. Through this workshop, with the inputs from national and international experts, the Disaster Management Department plans to prepare a roadmap to cope with the risks and disasters linked with climate change in the Sundarbans," said JanabJaved Khan, Minister in Charge of Disaster Management Department.

 

Both national and international experts attended the workshop inaugurated by Mr Biman Banerjee, Speaker of the West Bengal Assembly. Sundarban Affairs Minister, Mr ManturamPakhira; senior state government officials; and senior officials and experts from various countries participated in the inaugural programme held at the iconic Town Hall on 28 January 2015 at 3:00 pm.



"Keeping in mind the climatic changes in the landscape, we have long been pushing for developing a holistic Sundarbans-policy. We also feel that all long-term planning should be transboundary in nature as the Sundarbans is spread over both India and Bangladesh. This workshop is part of the exercise," stated a representative from WWF-India and EnGIO reminding that the initiative was born in 2010 in Kolkata in the presence of the then central environment ministers from both India and Bangladesh. "We need to adopt appropriate climate adaptations for the Sundarbans to minimize the risk," added the experts.
