Performances by Rekha Bhardwaj, Pandit Pranab Biswas, Bonnie Chakraborty, Rooshin Dalal and Desi Roots at Central Park as Delhi comes together to celebrate Earth Hour
New Delhi, March 23, 2013: Mobilizing the citizens of Delhi and India for a cause of global concern, WWF-India successfully concluded Earth Hour, the country’s largest environmental campaign, today with an event at Central Park, New Delhi, organized in partnership with the Government of Delhi and Anchor Panasonic. The event witnessed thousands of supporters coming together to pledge their commitment to Earth Hour.



Smt. Sheila Dikshit, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Delhi was present at the event, sending out a strong message to the citizens of Delhi to participate in this global movement. The Chief Minister, along with Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India and Mr. Dinesh Aggarwal, Managing Director, Anchor Panasonic, switched off the lights of Connaught Circle, which marked the start of Earth Hour across India. Performances by members of the Band Desi Roots opened the evening, followed by a spectacular hour long performance by well known singer Rekha Bhardwaj, who began by singing a special Earth Hour anthem, Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya, meaning ‘from darkness to light’. This anthem truly represents the essence of Earth Hour, that an hour of darkness is the first step towards a brighter future. Singers Pandit Pranab Biswas, Bonnie Chakraborty, and Rooshin Dalal brought the show to an end with their own rendition of the Earth Hour anthem.

4. ING Vysya Bank, Infosys, ITC, Taj, The Lalit, and hundreds more switched off non-essential lights across all their properties in the country.



5. Huge supporter base on social media like twitter, Facebook added to the success of the campaign this year.



6. Organizations like Woodland and ING Vysya step up commitment, pledge to give back to nature by lighting up villages in Central India and Odisha respectively, using renewable energy.





The objective behind Earth Hour is to demonstrate action against climate change, and initiate a mass movement towards more sustainable and healthy use of energy sources. Running in its fifth year this time, Earth Hour 2013 aims to introduce and raise awareness about renewable energy solutions as a practical and viable option available for individuals, organizations and governments to adopt to lead an environment friendly lifestyle.



Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister of Delhi, Smt. Sheila Dikshit thanked citizens of Delhi on taking Earth Hour 2013 to the next level. She said, “Delhi has had a long association with Earth Hour, and it is the citizens of this city that make it a grand success. I am confident that this year too, with the efforts of the government of Delhi and the citizens, we are one step closer to becoming a more sustainable city”



Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, “The nationwide participation in Earth Hour this year is testimony to the fact that the global crisis of climate change is of concern to the common man as well. This participative campaign encourages individuals to make conservation an intrinsic part of their everyday life. The message of making the shift to renewable energy has received a good response, and we hope Earth Hour will leave a mark in the mind of millions to be more conscious of the natural environment and responsible consumers.”



Addressing the audience, Mr. Dinesh Aggarwal, Joint Managing Director, Anchor Electricals, said, “We are elated to be part of such a global movement for climate change. As Anchor celebrates its 50 years of inception, it commits itself along with its parent Panasonic, to make products that enable energy generation, management and conservation. ‘Tamaso ma Jyotirgamay’ is also our motto as we endeavour to light up millions of homes with high quality but affordable products. Support of earth hour 2013 is a way of showing our commitment towards building a greener planet.”



Across the country, individuals, organizations and governments stepped up their commitment to Earth Hour. Many important landmarks across India such as India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhawan, Prime Ministers residence, Chief Ministers Residence, Red Fort, in New Delhi; Chhatrapati Shivaji Termunis, Gateway of India, in Mumbai; Victoria Memorial in Kolkota; Mysore Palace in Mysore; Charminar and Necklace Road in Hyderabad switched off for one hour.



The campaign has been endorsed by well-known celebrities like Ajay Devgn, Venkatesh Prasad, Jiiva, Shruti Hassan, Parambrata and Mary Kom, whose support helped propagate the message to the masses. Earth Hour has already successfully united hundreds of millions of people around the world. With such power behind the cause, a real and lasting change towards building a better future for the planet is an achievable target. Delhi and NCR switches off for Earth Hour 2013!
