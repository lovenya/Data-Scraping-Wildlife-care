Volunteers celebrated Plastic Bag Free Day last month by distributing cloth bags and calling for a “reuse” culture in the Khangchendzonga landscape
Sikkim/Darjeeling: Volunteers of the Zero Waste Himalaya Group observed the International Plastic Bag Free Day in Gangtok, Sikkim on 3 July 2015, by urging people to move from “use and throw” culture towards a sustainable “use, reuse and recycle” culture. The Zero Waste Himalaya Group is a platform comprising of NGOs -- WWF- India, Ecotourism and Conservation Society of Sikkim (ECOSS) and the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) -- and environmentally conscious  citizens. The group aims at spreading awareness on the environmental threats posed by solid waste in the region and encourages adoption of sustainable practices.



Sikkim is among the first few states in India to have banned plastic bags in 1998, following several landslides that occurred due to blocked drains, leading to human casualties in the capital city of Gangtok.  However, a recent survey conducted by the ECOSS showed that plastic bags were in circulation, especially in rural towns and villages, due to a lack of enforcement and monitoring.



The International Plastic Bag Free Day campaign advocated the use of cloth bags by distributing bags stitched by local self-help groups with recycled clothes. The campaign also focused on the emerging use of non-woven polypropylene bags, which are currently being handed out as a safer alternative to plastic bags. The Zero Waste Himalaya Group has recently petitioned the state government to bring these bags under the purview of the plastic bag ban, as they are equally harmful to the environment. The government has also been urged set up stringent monitoring against the use of plastic.



In Darjeeling, WWF- India partnered with the CHANGE Group and DLR Prerna to organize an awareness programme with the communities of Lebong village. Community based organizations, the Darjeeling municipality and students of schools in the area joined hands and held an awareness event on the harmful impacts of plastic bags in hilly areas.
