District Magistrate inaugurates WWF-India’s ‘Ramganga Chaupal’ for the city of Moradabad
Moradabad: WWF-India’s Secretary General & CEO, Mr. Ravi Singh along with District Magistrate of Moradabad, Shri Sanjay Kumar (IAS) inaugurated the ‘Ramganga Chaupal’, a dedicated space to know about the Ramganga ( its water quality, quantity, river path and biodiversity) river and various ways to be adopted to conserve it. Along with the District Magistrate, ‘Ramganga Chaupal’ was visited by other senior government officials including Additional District Magistrate, Shri Praveen Mishra, City Commissioner , Shri S.K. Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Shri Munne Ali and many others. WWF-India has developed content and creative exhibits in the Ramganga Chaupal which explore ecology, biology and the natural history of Ramganga and the surrounding river basin. WWF-India has also set up live-size biodiversity models (gharials, dolphins and turtles) to demonstrate the diverse set of aquatic biodiversity existing in Ramganga river. Also, the locals and visitors will be able to enjoy both scheduled and self guided tours of the centre and an enhanced river trail system.



This Ramganga centre is a kind of new-style museum, providing platform for visitors to understand the origin, course and nature of Ramganga river, thereby making them aware about the challenges faced by the river. Ramganga Chaupal at First Floor, HIG-40, Ramganga Vihar Colony- 2, Moradabad successfully highlighted diverse themes/issues related to Ramganga river through creative exhibits to connect with the stakeholders. 



These included:



1. The state of the River - Water Quantity, Quality, Biodiversity and River Path

2. Ecosystem services and livelihoods provided by the river

3. Threats to the health of the river - Pollution from Industries, Agriculture and the City

4. Some approaches to revive the river – Rainwater Harvest, Mapping Water Foot Print & Smart Agricultural Practices

5. Moradabad city’s dependence on its water



Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO WWF-India said, “WWF-India was able to work in Moradabad with the kind support of District Administration and I am extremely grateful to the District Magistrate for helping us reach all our stakeholders. I am happy to share that ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’ campaign in Moradabad city has brought this city up in WWF’s work which also exists across 120 nations. It is imperative that we try connect with maximum number of community members to take this conservation work forward. WWF-India’s Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers programme envisions Ganga and Ramganga, one of its major tributaries as healthy river systems that are rich in biodiversity, providing long term water security to communities and nature.” 



‘Ramganga Chaupal’ is expected to become the signature attraction for the city of Moradabad. It will be a resource for school and college students and citizens from all walks of life. A series of activities have been planned for the centre including teacher training programmes, training of the Government officials and college students on measures to be adopted to conserve the river. The Chaupal will also showcase documentary on Ramganga which aims to highlight the issues/challenges faced by Ramganga river and to inform/involve/engage diverse stakeholders, inspiring them to become friends of Ramganga river and take complete ownership of its ecological wellbeing. The guests present at the event appeared enjoying the documentary film, especially after catching glimpses of the Ganga dolphin showcased in the movie. The movie made the viewers travel across the river stretch, showcasing the various realities of Ramganga river. 



“I congratulate the entire team of WWF-India for putting up this brilliant exhibition on our very own Ramganga river. We all know unless all the community members come together, Ramganga conservation work cannot succeed. Coordinated work amongst all the stakeholders is imperative to achieve our shared vision of a clean & green Ramganga. I along with WWF-India experts recently undertook a boat ride where I noticed many people washing electronic waste. Our Ramganga is currently suffering with three major issues – industrial waste, e-waste and pollution carried by Dhela river. District Administration of Moradabad will proactively work towards countering the city’s sewage by installing a sewage treatment plant by 2014. However, it is crucial that all the community members actively take this campaign forward and become fully aware of their respective water consumption. District Adminsitration & WWF-India will partner with already established organizations like NSS, NCC and School Scouts to engage them in river bank cleaning activities and inform young adults in the ongoing campaign. We will also partner with Nagar Nigam in identifying degrading wetlands and would request Ramganga Mitras to take required actions to revive them. Finally, lets pledge today that we would reduce our consumption of polythene, would plant one sapling each year and ensure the conservation of water at our respective households!” said Shri Sanjay Kumar, IAS, District Magistrate.



Ramganga Chaupal will be soon hosting awareness generation activities that include conducting Ramganga Sansads, Block & District level meetings, River Trails, Ramganga Mitras meeting etc. to inspire diverse communities for taking complete ownership for the ecological wellbeing of the river. 

“The programme believes that it is vital to mobilize community members’ participation in conservation activities and develop a coordinated framework for collaboration between all stakeholders. To take this forward, ‘Ramganga Chaupal’ will play a critical role in providing community members a platform to discuss/debate and deliberate on Ramganga conservation activities, thereby making them active agents of change and a Ramganga mitra’, added Mr Suresh Babu, Director River Basins & Water Policy.
