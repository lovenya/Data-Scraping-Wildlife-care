Celebrating International Tiger Day with Thumbs-Up for Tigers
New Delhi: Tigers are one of the world’s most iconic species and crucial for the ecosystems in which they live. However, despite intensive conservation efforts for over three decades, the wild tiger population in the world has declined by 97% in the last century. In 2010, with tiger numbers at an all time low, the tiger range governments committed to an ambitious and visionary goal of Tx2- to double wild tigers by 2022, the next Chinese Year of the Tiger.

 

International Tiger Day, also known as Global Tiger Day, held globally on July 29, celebrates this iconic species and helps promote the need for the conservation of tigers in the wild and the protection of their habitats. The initiative was started in 2010 at the St. Petersburg Tiger Summit. The International Tiger Day 2016 is especially important since it marks the halfway point of Tx2 and a shout-out to governments and countries across the world to review and strengthen its existing efforts to save the animal.

 

The Tx2 approach looks at doubling the number of tigers in the wild, rather than just saving the animal in each of the countries in which it is present. This strategic focus looks at not only protecting tigers but protecting landscapes including source sites and corridors. It also encourages trans-boundary collaboration between countries for tiger conservation. The Tx2 initiative marks the first time that all tiger range countries have come together to collaborate and work together towards a global goal of protecting this apex predator.

 

WWF is a major driving force behind the Tx2 campaign and is running a “Thumbs-Up for Tigers” campaign to mark the International Tiger Day 2016. Built around the premise of tiger stripes being unique to each animal, the campaign encourages people to show their support for the animal through social media channels by colouring their thumbs with tiger stripes, each thumb print being unique to every human. In Delhi, WWF-India is partnering with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and other organizations to organize the “Walk for the Tiger”, scheduled to be held at on 29 July 2016 at 7am at the India Gate. Bringing together people from all walks of life and students from schools across Delhi, the walk will build awareness in children about the species and inspire them to undertake simple initiatives in their daily lives for a greener planet.

 

Speaking about the event and the conservation of tigers, Dr. Dipankar Ghose, Director, Species and Landscapes, WWF-India said, “It is time every citizen of India does his/ her bit to save the National Animal. Pressures like poaching, conflict with human beings, habitat degradation and blocked corridors are to be tackled collectively by government departments, NGOs and local communities. Events like the International Tiger Day would help bring the focus on conserving tigers and their habitats. ”

 

 

With over 57% of the world’s wild tigers in India, WWF-India works towards protecting tigers and their prey base, while working with the State Forest Departments to maintain and restore tiger habitats and corridors across most tiger landscapes in India. WWF-India has been working for over three decades now with various stakeholders, including local communities, the forest department, other government agencies, media, school children and civil society for the protection of this majestic species.
