Four-day event paves way for a long-term health support programmeThe Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), situated in the West Champaran district of Bihar, houses some of the most diverse ecosystems and wildlife in the country. To enhance protection and safety of these pristine forests, WWF-India has been mobilizing its stakeholders—the Bihar  forest department, its officials, managerial and frontline staff as well as the local communities and NGOs working in VTR— to participate and contribute towards conservation measures.



The forest personnel and their families live and work under very difficult circumstances in this remote tiger reserve nestled on the Indo-Nepal border. Their job mainly entails working in the thick of the forest, braving wild animals, poachers, and the harsh terrain.



These personnel are the first and last line of defence protecting some of the country’s most precious and endangered wildlife. However, with almost no contact with the nearest towns, its conveniences and facilities, they are deprived of even the basic medical care.



Recognizing their life of struggle as overburdened daily-wage earners with barely any access to the basic facilities that most of us take for granted, WWF-India organized a four-day health camp for the forest staff and their families across VTR. Held from 27-30 November 2014, this medical camp was part of a larger programme to boost the morale of the forest staff and enhance their social and physical wellbeing. It will now be ensured that their medical needs are attended to on a regular basis.



The health camp was conducted in four ranges of VTR – Manguraha, Gobardhana, Ganauli and Madanpur – under the supervision of Dr Mudit Gupta of WWF and his team comprising Dr Kamlesh K. Maurya, Mr Kandhai Lal, Rohit Ravi and Saikat Sutradhar.



The doctors were appointed by the state health department, in consultation with the deputy directors of VTR and district magistrate of Bettiah, the administrative headquarters of the West Champaran district. Several Primary Health Centre (PHC) staff assisted the team. The medicines were jointly distributed by WWF-India and the PHC staff. In all, nearly 600 forest staff attended the health camps and got favourable advice and prescriptions.

The data gathered by the doctors threw light into the general medical problems faced by the forest personnel and their families and paved way for a long-term health support programme for them. “Initiatives such as this have an extremely positive effect on the morale of the staff and helps strengthening the mutual relationship between WWF-India and the forest department. We are happy to know that our needs and issues are understood and empathized with,” said Mr SantoshTiwary, Field Director, VTR, appreciating the health support plan.
