New Delhi: WWF-India today launched its much-awaited volunteer programme, WWF Volunteers, aimed at inspiring individuals and organizations across the country to take positive conservation action for a better planet. Reaching out to people from all walks of life including students, resident welfare associations, corporate employees, senior citizens and home makers, the programme offers exciting conservation projects and opportunities to work together towards creating a conservation impact in one’s own circle.



The event saw participation from various organizations, corporations and educational institutions to celebrate and promote volunteerism. A panel discussion on 'The Role of Citizens in Environmental Conservation' hosted by Ms. Neha Buch, CEO, Pravah, rounded up the afternoon, highlighting the need for every individual to be a part of the movement for a greener Earth.



Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India, while talking about the importance of citizen participation in conservation said, “Environmental degradation is a concern for everyone in the world today. We have seen through our engagements with individuals and organizations, a strong interest in participating in initiatives towards positive action. This programme is a platform to bring together people with a common interest for nature conservation in an informed and responsible manner.”

 

Talking about the programme, Ms. Radhika Suri, Director,Environment Education, WWF-India said, “WWF Volunteers currently has projects underway in states such as Delhi, Goa, Telangana, Assam and Kerala, and will eventually reach out to all parts of the country. Under the aegis of this programme, WWF-India welcomes volunteers with diverse skill sets like designing, writing and training. The volunteers will work on wide ranging conservation projects in the areas of bio-diversity, environment law, education and skill-building, among others. The plethora of projects that the programme offers has the capacity to include anyone who is interested in donating their time and skills for a better future.”

 

WWF-India intends to influence a large section of the Indian population to significantly improve the country's ecological condition in the future and sees citizen participation as central to the achievement of this mission. The WWF Volunteers programme will empower citizens and organizations to engage directly by working on-ground in WWF conservation projects, and hopefully inspire greater conscientiousness towards the environment.
