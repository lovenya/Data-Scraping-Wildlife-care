As a warm way of saying thank you, fleece winter jackets were distributed for their invaluable contribution to the park. In his welcome address, Mr. Bijoy Joy, Park Director, Keoladeo National Park said, “In the park, rickshaw pullers, nature guides and organisations like WWF-India work together as a team. Each and every individual is important and we all function like parts of a car, collectively contributing to the journey”



Six individuals Mr. Sohan Lal (Rtd. Forester), Mr. Bhupan ( Rtd. Forest Guard), Mr. Shrichand ( Rtd. Forest Guard), Mr. Chiranji ( Forest Guard), Mr. Hatela (Forest Guard) and Mr. Bholu Khan ( Rtd.

On being felicitated, they spoke of the how they got associated with the park, sharing nostalgic memories and encouraging the new staff to sustain the ongoing conservation initiatives.  



In appreciation of the event organized, Mr. Rajpal Singh, Member State Wildlife Board said, “The work done by the people at the ground level is commendable, they are intrinsic to the overall functioning of the park and it is important that their efforts are honoured. An event of this kind is a special way of doing so”  

Mr. Ravi Singh, C.E.O., WWF-India said, “Conservation initiatives in Bharatpur are unique because of the collective efforts of the Forest Department, local communities, WWF-India and other organisations. It is a model that the rest of the country looks to and it is important that we keep the spirit going”. Mr. Singh also spoke of a host of new initiatives being planned by WWF-India in Keoladeo National Park including new signages and a new cycle rickshaw prototype that is being researched in Boston University that is more comfortable for the tourist as well as for the puller.



WWF-India has also been working to promote awareness and action on water conservation in Bharatpur through the Water School Programme in 90 schools across 30 villages. A Warm ‘Thank You’ to the Rickshaw pullers, Nature Guides and Forest Staff of Keoladeo National Park
