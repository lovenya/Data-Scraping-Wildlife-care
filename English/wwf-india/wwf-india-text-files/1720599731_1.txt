CITES Secretary-General John E. Scanlon met with Brazil High Court Justice Antonio Herman Benjamin, Chair of the IUCN World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL), and addressed its Steering Committee on the disturbing upward trends with the illegal international trade in wildlife, and most particularly the poaching of the African elephant and rhino for their ivory and horn, respectively. “The IUCN Commissions comprise vast global volunteer networks that we hope to see further mobilized to support the fight against wildlife crime, and in particular to assist in combatting the illegal killing of elephants and rhinos for their ivory and horn” said Mr. John Scanlon, Secretary General of CITES. Such crucial policy decisions from CITES have serious impacts on Indian populations, as in the past. For more information, please click :
