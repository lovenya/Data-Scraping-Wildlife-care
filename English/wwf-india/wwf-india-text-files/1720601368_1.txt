In Memory - Dr. M. S. Swaminathan

Posted on 28 September 2023





It is with deep regret that we learn of the demise of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan who served as Trustee and President of WWF-India between the years 1989-1996 and later as President Emeritus.



Dr. Swaminathan was associated with many of WWF-Indiaâ€™s programmes on biodiversity conservation and was instrumental in building synergies between science and conservation.



We offer our condolences to his family and friends.
