Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary | Assam: The Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary received its first rhinos in 25 years from the Kaziranga National Park in March 2016. The mother and the calf were translocated as part of the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) Program – that seeks to increase the number and range of rhinos in Assam through wild-to-wild translocation.



Unfortunately, the calf who has been locally christened as ‘Ramani’ lost her mother within some time to natural causes. The silver lining being that the calf continued to thrive well in her new home despite the loss.

A new challenge reared its head in the form of incessant rains and associated flooding severely threatening the calf. This year, the sanctuary suffered three waves of floods since the month of May severely affecting patrolling in the area. It also greatly restricted the movement of the joint team comprising WWF-India personnel, Forest Department, and those from partner organizations who were closely monitoring the calf. The holding enclosure – boma – of the calf was well constructed with a thorough understanding of the flood regime in the sanctuary given its location on the southern banks of the Brahmaputra River.



To make matters worse the floods also washed away the only connecting wooden bridge near Shantibazar to Dhania Forest Range office of the Sanctuary. Three other portions of the road were also washed away, disrupting the entire road network. The Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) in-charge of Burachapori WLS reached out to WWF-India and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Wildlife (PCCF-WL) requesting assistance to draw up and implement an emergency plan to keep Ramani safe including the option to relocate her, if needed.



 On July 25 and 26, a joint team comprising officials from the forest department and WWF-India managed to reach the enclosure with great difficulty. While Ramani had moved to safety on the higher ground within the boma, supplying her with feed on a regular basis posed a massive challenge. This was accomplished by the team who managed to supply her with fresh fodder using a makeshift bamboo raft.



Meanwhile, in the state capital Guwahati, a conscious decision was taken not to relocate the calf as the rescue operation might prove to be more dangerous. The DFO was advised on the measures to be undertaken to ensure maximum possible safety for the rhino and the people engaged in the support operation.



With water level rising continuously, the support team itself struggled as access to drinking water and other basic facilities became more and more difficult. The team had to be rescued by the Assistant Conservator of Forests and Dhania Range in Charge on July 27.



 The rhino calf displayed immense courage during the floods. As the water levels rose she constantly moved to higher ground. She also responded well to the regular supply of fresh fodder and other food supplements.



 “Ramani showed immense resilience during the difficult time. It was her strong will that she has bravely survived the floods, and is hale and hearty now”, says Deba Dutta, a WWF-India team member leading the relief operations.



Post the floods, extra fodder in five locations on both the highlands used by the calf has been set aside. Supply of fresh tree twigs and mineral supplements has also been maintained. WWF-India has also sought to enhance protection by  providing one mechanized country boat and three country boats in addition to other support to the park authorities.



Ramani’s  courage and endurance has  helped boost the morale of all members of the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 translocation team in Assam.
