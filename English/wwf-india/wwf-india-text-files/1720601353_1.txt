Remembering Gitanjali Aiyar

Posted on 09 June 2023


WWF-India mourns the loss of Gitanjali Aiyar, an indomitable voice for conservation in India, and a renowned newsreader and television personality. Gitanjali headed WWF-India's, Major Donors division in 2011 and was instrumental in setting up the Philanthropy Giving Program.



Ms Aiyar started her career in Doordarshan in 1976, becoming a prominent face on TV news and later moved on to become one of the biggest supporters of Indiaâ€™s biodiversity conservation. During her tenure with WWF-India, she represented the organisation in key forums.



She will be remembered as a champion of our work and more than that, as a rare and wonderful human being. An exemplary and empathetic colleague; her perseverance, presence, and optimism will be missed.
