In Memory - Mrs. Anne Wright

Posted on 05 October 2023

With a sense of loss, we learned of the passing away of Mrs. Anne Wright yesterday at her home near Kanha Tiger Reserve. Mrs. Anne Wright was amongst WWF-India’s first Trustees at the founding of the organisation and led several initiatives for conservation of wildlife, in particular the tiger – with Project Tiger- for rhinos in Assam and elephant and wildlife habitats. Her contributions were considerable, at the national level and as the Regional Trustee of our Eastern Region based in Kolkata.



Some of our team members and associates remember her well. We convey our condolences to Mrs. Anne Wright’s family and close friends.
