‘Earth Hour’ 2010 is garnering more support than ever. As a precursor to the main event on March 27th, schools from around Delhi participated in a competition on Original Song Composition “Earth Symphony” organized by WWF- India.



Young musicians from schools such as DPS International, Khaitan Public School, G D Salwan Public School and Bal Bhawan Public School participated in this event spreading the message on the need for immediate action on climate change through their compositions. These compositions expressed the anguish of a dying mother pleading to mankind to come together in the face of climate change. The compositions by these young participants beautifully brought home the theme “The power of individual action for a sustainable future”. 



Mr. Nishant Mudgal –music producer, song writer, vocalist associated with a Delhi based band, Karma and Mr. Sameer – music producer were judges for the competition. Indian Ocean (Himanshu Joshi, Amit Kilam and Druv Jagasia), the well known rock band graced the occasion as Guests of Honor. Supporting the cause they exhorted everyone to participate in Earth Hour stating ‘Switch off or switch-off forever’. They went on to add “we are glad to be associated with this initiative . These children remind us how the small choices we make create a huge difference. Its time to act as responsible citizens of the world as climate change is something that affects the entire planet”.
