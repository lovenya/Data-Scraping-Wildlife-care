The Secretary-General of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Executive Director of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate access to expertise for the care of confiscated live animals, the provision of training and raising public awareness in the implementation of CITES, as part of the UN International Decade of Biodiversity. 



Illegal trade in animals is increasing and belongs, together with illegal drug traffic, to the most alarming illegal businesses. WAZA and its members are committed to assist CITES in implementing animal trade regulations and ensuring the conservation of species affected by trade”, says Dr Gerald Dick, Executive Director of WAZA.



Commenting on the agreement, the CITES Secretary-General, Mr John E. Scanlon, said: "Our collaboration with the WAZA network will assist CITES Parties in meeting their obligations to care for confiscated animals and in the transport of live animals, which will be supported through enhanced training and capacity building opportunities."
