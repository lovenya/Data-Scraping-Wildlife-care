Background

Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh has a high biological significance given the varied forest types and the wildlife it harbors in its 862 sq. km. area. It is situated in the East and West Kameng Districts of Arunachal Pradesh. Together with the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve of Assam it provides an excellent habitat for large mammals.



Surveying Pakke’s mammals

In 2003 WWF-India’s North Bank Landscape Conservation Programme (NBL) was involved in a biodiversity survey to look at the floral diversity in the project area. The study found the area being second richest in the globe in terms of plant functional type value*. Subsequently, a study of the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), co-predators, its prey and habitat was carried out here in February-March 2010 by the NBL team. 



Led by Dr. Jimmy Borah, the survey was carried out using passive camera traps to gather direct evidence of the different species that thrive in the survey area. 30 pairs of camera traps were laid at intervals ranging from 2 to 3 km. This was done to ensure maximum coverage of the study area could be covered. Each camera was operational 24 hours a day for 54 days, which translated to 1080 camera trap nights.



Encouraging results

The range of this cat is spread over Bhutan, Myanmar, India, Nepal, southern China and Malayan countries. Listed as Vulnerable by IUCN (2010) and as a Schedule I species under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972, not much is known about their numbers in these range countries. Their short, powerful legs and large paws help in an arboreal lifestyle and put them at par with the best climbers in Felids. They use their thick tails, which are as long as their head-body length, to maintain balance on the trees. Scientists believe they mostly feed on monkeys, deer, boars and smaller mammals. This cat has the largest canine teeth to body size ratio of all wild cat species. 



Securing the future

Land use change, human encroachment of habitat and hunting – chiefly for its pelt are the main threats to its survival. There is an urgent need to design a long term conservation plan for the species before their populations reach critical levels. 



* The WWF initiative was implemented in technical collaboration with Australia’s Centre for Biodiversity Management (CBM), with support from the MacArthur Foundation and the Smithsonian’s center for research and conservation. Two teams from WWF, the Forest Departments of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, Wildlife Institute of India and the Botanical Survey of India, undertook the appraisal of vegetation and large mammal habitats within the landscape as a precursor to establishing a broader regional conservation management framework.
