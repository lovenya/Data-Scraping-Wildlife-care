WWF-India and CDP India launched the Science-Based Target initiative Incubator to enhance the uptake of science-based targets among Indian businesses. The initiative is supported by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation. The incubator will handhold Indian companies in developing SBTs, and accelerate their transition to a low-carbon economy.
