Earth Hour 2024 aims to create the Biggest Hour for Earth, stressing the collective power of individuals and communities in tackling climate and nature loss challenges

 

New Delhi, 12th March 2024: Earth Hour serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of our planet, the need to protect it, and how little time we have to do so. The 'Goodwill Ambassadors for Earth Hour India' are committed to lending their support by giving an hour for Earth, spending 60 minutes doing something positive for our planet. Their actions will inspire others to join the movement and make the Biggest Hour for Earth even bigger this year.

 

For her association with Earth Hour, Dia Mirza said, "I'm excited to lend my voice to WWF-India's Earth Hour. Every year, I look forward to the Switch Off movement, which makes a ripple around the country — and the world — and I ardently hope that this time, we will create the biggest Earth Hour ever. This year, I will switch off all lights and electronic gadgets for an hour and have a candlelight dinner with my family. We will spend quality time playing Scrabble on the balcony, surrounded by lanterns. I also ensure that every day for an hour, my son bonds with nature and learns to appreciate its profound magic. At home, we segregate and compost waste, refuse single-use plastics, and conserve energy and water because we believe that every little thing we do to care for the environment adds up. Let us keep adding to positive micro-actions and dedicate not just one hour a year to the Earth but live in harmony with her daily."

 

In an increasingly divided world, Earth Hour is a beacon of positivity, hope, and inspiration within the environmental movement. It is a reminder that environmentalism can be a positive force for change. Earth Hour fosters a global community that transcends boundaries, promoting a mindset shift toward sustainability.

 

Dulquer Salmaan, also the WWF-India Nature Guardian Ambassador, supports Earth Hour 2024, "Every year, Earth Hour unites millions of people in India and around the world. We all step up for the planet by taking small steps to live a more sustainable life. I will be switching off all non-essential lights to mark Earth Hour 2024. I request you all to join me and make this the Biggest Hour for Earth."

 

Earth Hour 2024 aims to create the Biggest Hour for Earth, stressing the collective power of individuals and communities in tackling climate and nature loss challenges. The overarching goal is to inspire long-term commitments to energy efficiency, sustainable practices, and a shared responsibility for a resilient and optimistic future.
