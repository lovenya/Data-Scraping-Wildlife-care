WWF-India and UP Forest Department release nursery-reared turtle hatchlings
Meerut: More than 100 river turtle hatchlings were released by community members and schoolchildren of Meerut District, Uttar Pradesh at Maqhdoompur Ghat, on the banks of river Ganga, where these hatchlings have a better chance of survival. The release has been a part of a collaborative turtle conservation project, jointly initiated by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department along with WWF-India in January 2013. The release day, which began early, saw excited communities and enthusiastic schoolchildren coming together to transfer the tiny hatchlings to their new home the Ganga. The event was attended by Mr Lalit Kumar Verma (DFO-Meerut), Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Mr Navneet Singh Chahal (IAS) and Dr Asghar Nawab, a senior biodiversity expert from WWF-India.



“Through this event we hope to succeed in changing attitudes toward river turtles and generate awareness about the importance of their presence in the river’s ecology. Hopefully, whenever turtles are caught or their eggs are sighted, the community members will be encouraged to inform us so that they can be rescued. The administration is also keen to take up the cause of conservation seriously by engaging with more districts and implement existing policies on the protection of the aquatic species,” said Mr Navneet Singh Chahal (SDM-Mawana).



The hatchlings, as old as 5 months were protected after WWF-India and the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department located a total of 31 turtle nests along fields of the riverbed of an approximate 49 km stretch. Of these, 24 nests belonged to Batagur dhongoka, six nests belonged to Pangshura tentoria and one nest to the Pangshura smithii species. After retrieving them, nurturing and protecting at the turtle nursery constructed by WWF-India at the Forest Training Centre in Hastinapur, a total of 118 hatchlings survived. Pangshura smithii recorded 100 per cent hatchling success, followed by Batagur dhongoka which recorded 97.22 per cent and Pangshura tentoria 15.09 per cent. 



“This event promotes the involvement of riparian communities (especially riverbed cultivators) by encouraging community-led monitoring and conservation of turtle nests in their agricultural fields, ensuring a sense of ownership and desire for stewardship towards biodiversity conservation. Through this event we would also like to highlight the growing threats to these species and seek support from other districts which are closer to the riverbank to unite in this conservation initiative. The local administration plays a vital role in ensuring that these engendered species receive the much required protection,” said Dr Asghar Nawab, Senior Coordinator, WWF-India.



In the Upper Ganga River, a total of 12 freshwater turtle species have been identified. Of these, six are considered endangered and listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Although turtles have been accorded legal protection, the laws are not effective in the field and their exploitation goes unabated. Further depletion in turtle populations is mainly due to habitat loss which is largely due to riverbed cultivation and collection of sand from nesting sites. This also leads to loss of turtle eggs which are also predated upon by humans, stray and wild animals. Freshwater turtles in India have received incidental protection in different sanctuaries specially created for crocodile conservation since 1975. In this case, it is the re-introduction of the Gharial and regular monitoring which will help turtle species thrive in similar aquatic habitats and be conserved effectively.
