The Global Tiger Day (GTD) 2015 was celebrated with a variety of awareness building activities in WWF-India’s priority landscapes on Wednesday, 29 July 2015. This year marks the fifth consecutive year of GTD, which was first declared at the St.Petersburg Tiger Summit in 2010 to raise awareness about the urgency to save the world’s wild tigers. The big cat population has declined globally, due to several factors including poaching, habitat loss and human-tiger conflict. GTD is also part of the Tx2 pledge undertaken by the Tiger Range Countries to double the world’s tiger population by 2022 -- the next Chinese year of the tiger.

 

This GTD, WWF-India engaged with local communities and kids to raise awareness about the tiger.



 

Terai Arc:

At the Madanpur range, near Valmiki Tiger Reserve, over 600 students from 10 schools wore tiger masks and participated in an early morning rally with posters and banners.



Drawing and quiz competitions, skits and dance shows were organized by the kids. WWF-PATA Bagh Mitra award winner Mr. Nand Kishore, former DFO cum deputy director, VTR, also attended the event.  Subsidized LPG connections were distributed  among the locals living in the fringe areas to promote  energy efficiency as well as reduce HWC.





 



Western India Tiger Landscape: 

A street play was held at Bhuri Pahari, a village on the fringe of Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (RTR), to explain the cause of human-wildlife conflict (HWC) and precautionary measures that villagers could adopt to minimize them. A rally led by school students also spread awareness on the importance of protecting tigers. Posters on how to prevent HWC were distributed.

 

In the village of Khandaar near RTR, WWF-India held a short seminar on the importance of saving tigers in a higher secondary school and discussed how students could become active volunteers to support the cause. Community meetings were held in Gothbihari and Sawas villages to reinforce the importance of protecting tigers and reducing HWC.



 



North Bank and Kaziranga Karbi Anglong: 

A full-day tiger awareness programme was organized at the Lokopriyo High School in Behali, Sonitpur. A local interschool art competition on the theme of tiger conservation was held. Wildlife films were also screened for students, teachers, the local bureaucracy and village leadership.

A community meeting was also held in Behali, in the fringes of the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve to discuss the importance of the river islands in conservation of wildlife.





Western Ghats Nilgiris: 

GTD awareness programmes were held in Stanes Higher Secondary School, Coimbatore; as well as in the Government High Schools of Germalam and Sathyamangalam.



At Stanes high school, WWF-India held a joint event with the Bookmark Library, Round Table and Ladies Circle India. About 15o local students participated in a ‘tiger march’ waving placards, posters and flags with ‘Save the tiger’ message. A walkathon was also held on the occasion.



At the Government High School, Sathyamangalam, students took an oath to protect tigers for the future generations. Caps and tiger masks were distributed to students. In Germalam, students built ‘newspaper forest’ and organized games like ‘tiger hunt drama’ to discuss key wildlife issues.







Sundarbans: 

In Bali Island, local NGO Bali Nature and Wildlife Conservation Society partnered with WWF-India to organize an awareness programme for children. Drawing competitions and educational film screenings were held.  About 37 students participated in the events.
