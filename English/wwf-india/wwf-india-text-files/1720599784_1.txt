Marking its fifth year in India, Earth Hour 2013 was observed by individuals, organizations, institutions and governments in more than 150 Indian cities. Earth Hour, a global initiative was launched by WWF to celebrate cities that are taking action towards building a sustainable city for its citizens. 



The Earth Hour City Challenge invited cities from across the world to submit credible urban development plans that contributed towards increasing the city’s use of renewable energy. New Delhi featured among the top six cities for the Earth Hour Global Capital challenge, which was won by Vancouver. This year, India’s Earth Hour campaign had events spread across the four metros and other nodal cities. 



The Delhi chapter of Earth Hour, witnessed a performance by singer Rekha Bhardwaj at an event organized at Central Park, Connaught Circle, in which over 2500 individuals participated. Thereafter the lights in the area were turned off and the venue was illuminated with solar lanterns and candles. The event culminated with a symbolic gesture by singers Pandit Pranab Biswas, Bonnie Chakraborty specially-composed Earth Hour anthem – Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya which translates as – from darkness to light. Signature campaigns to musical evenings, cyclothons, candlelit marches, walkathons, dance performances, miming shows, magic shows, flash mobs and recycling drives marked Earth Hour and it emerged as a campaign that could transcend borders and affect change.
