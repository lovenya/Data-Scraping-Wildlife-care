The Greater One-horned Rhino is one of the most endangered species of the Indian mega fauna, which was once found across the northern floodplains and foothills of the Indian sub-continent.



In view of The World Rhino Day, TRAFFIC would like to take the opportunity to release this poster to raise awareness about poaching and illegal trade of Rhinos in India. Dr. Shekhar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC India, believes that “Things are looking good since there has been a steady rise in Rhino population in India. Despite the fact that poaching is in the works, it has greatly declined since 1991-one of the highest poaching years for Rhino in India. After coming down to the second highest poaching figures in 2013, we have managed to bring it down by about a significant 40-50 %.  Since 2014, the enforcement and anti-poaching activities have been spruced up; Intelligence work for combating illegal wildlife trade by TRAFFIC and other enforcement agencies has resulted in bringing down the rate of poaching from the 2013 level.”



We encourage a more aggressive approach towards the containment of Rhino poaching in India and believe that if effective coordination is brought about amongst the National and State Governments along with various enforcement agencies, the Rhino could have a promising future. This World Rhino Day, let’s take one step ahead in securing the Rhino population of India.



With the interview illustrated below, Dr. Shekhar Niraj provides an insight on the status of Rhino population in India.



1. Today on the World Rhino Day, how do you feel about the future of Rhinos in India?

Things are looking good since there has been a steady rise in Rhino population in India. Despite the fact that poaching is in the works, it has greatly declined since 1991-one of the highest poaching years for Rhino in India. After coming down to the second highest poaching figures in 2013, we have managed to bring it down by about a significant 40-50 %.  Since 2014, the enforcement and anti-poaching activities have been spruced up; Intelligence work for combating illegal wildlife trade by TRAFFIC and other enforcement agencies has resulted in bringing down the rate of poaching from the 2013 level. Secondly, habitat is improving which is an important factor in securing the rhino population. Further, to talk about the third dimension of conservation i.e. policy, has been well poised and conducive in bringing down the surge in poaching levels from 2013.In light of these facts, the future of rhinos looks promising in India.

 

2. Which species of Rhino is found in India?

The One horned rhino- Rhinoceros unicornis is predominant in India.

 

3. What is the population status and distribution of Rhinos in India?Rhino population is between 2100-2300 distributed over 3 states – Assam, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Assam inhabits the maximum Rhino population at about 90 %. Bengal and Uttar Pradesh account for a small part of the Indian Rhino population. Rhinos in Uttar Pradesh constitute the rehabilitated population from about 30 years ago.

 

4. To the best of your knowledge, what is the single most immediate threat to Rhinos in India and globally? 

The single most threat, I would say, is poaching. To affirm this claim is the fact that habitats are secure and have not been adversely affected in rhino ranges by external factors such as human activities, loss of grass lands, and more. Flood is a reoccurring phenomenon every year and averages out the Rhino population from the same.  Poaching is the sole activity that affects Rhinos very abominably because it is externally influenced by the demand in the international market. When demand increases, poaching efforts seriously rise. With such high demands, poachers adopt new methods and technologies and legal loopholes to poach Rhinos and maximise profits, thereby, increasing the risk of saving the population.

 

5. How many Rhinos were poached in last year?  Has this number decreased in the past few years?A total of 22 Rhinos were reportedly poached last year.

Yes, this number has come down in the past few years. As I said before, in 2013 the statistics showed a surge in Rhino poaching with 43 rhinos poached. In 2014, poaching numbers came down to 32 known cases. Since then, conservation efforts have borne some results and shown positive impacts in control of poaching with a 50% decline from the figure in 2013.

 

6. What drives Rhino poaching in India? 

International market is the major driver of Rhino poaching in India. Demand is ever growing along with a high price of rhino bones accounting to a few millions in the illegal wildlife market. Following the basic economic principle, price goes up due to high demand and lesser supply as a result of tighter control measures.

 

7. Do you feel the conservation efforts underway are enough to protect Rhinos in India?

I would consider conservation efforts as good but not sufficient. To further substantiate this statement, I would stress on the fact that the anti-poaching and anti-illegal trade measures are not enough to cope with the kind of pressure which is coming from outside. To make it clear, the high price and international demand has already made the Rhinos vulnerable. A similar thing happened in Africa- that accounts for the highest population of Rhinos as well as the greatest number of poaching reports, when the anti-poaching and anti-trade activities were up-scaled to a highly combative level.



In order to do something like that, India needs to pay emphasis on three things. A robust intelligence collection mechanism should be in place and we should have well-coordinated surveillance in security mechanisms. Lastly, if you have intelligence then there should be a backbone to support it. Modern and resilient techniques and technology to combat anti-poaching like drones, scanners, camera traps, and a well trained staff are needed to back the intelligence agencies.

 

8. What is the global status of poaching and illegal trade in Rhinos?

Rhinos are the most poached species anywhere in the world. The Highest supply comes from Africa- which has the largest Rhino population in the world. Coincidently, Africa recorded a historically large total of 1004 Rhinos poached in 2013, when the world poaching levels were at an all time high. The Rhino remains extremely vulnerable in India, Africa and some south-eastern countries such as Indonesia. Since the constantly exaggerated demand, the status of Rhinos becomes critical in India when Africa tightens anti-poaching measures. Owing to the concentrated population of Rhino in a few areas in India, the threat becomes even greater. At the same time, it should also be easy to control this threat for the same reason.

 

9. Does it affect Rhinos in India?

Yes, historically it has been registered that there is a direct correlation between poaching levels in India and Africa with respect to Rhinos and elephants (both present majorly in India and Africa). Whenever, poaching levels increase in Africa, there is a rise in poaching levels in India as well. At the same time, the protection status of Rhino is very high in some areas of Africa with sturdy anti-poaching measures. When the supply decreases from Africa, the Indian rhinos meet up the demand. In India, rhinos are prominent near the borders which make the population more vulnerable due to this proximity.

 

10. Nepal has celebrated this last year as a ‘zero poaching year’; do you think India can follow the league? 

The situation in Nepal is very different as Nepal is a very small country with an extremely limited population of economic species like Rhino and Tiger. Control will be higher and more effective in such a country as compared to a vast country like India. At times, the Nepal border becomes a big factor for poaching in India. There have been a few incidents when poachers, based in Nepal, network their way into India to illegally poach these animals. The situation is not parallel; however, I would like to alternately appreciate the measures taken up by Nepal. The Nepalese army has played an important role since 1970s for Rhino protection and the community is greatly involved in anti-poaching activities. In order to directly involve local communities, remunerative collection work by enforcement agencies and Community based surveillance units have been set up. Aggressive campaigns involving the local communities have also been taken up. These two tactics, definitely, need to be followed up by India.



Since the stake of poaching along with demand is very high, unless a strong coordination amongst various enforcement and security forces including the Army, BSF, SSB, and the central intelligence units along with the forest department are all given important roles and effective coordination achieved, the efforts of Nepal can’t be replicated. If such coordination can be achieved in India, then we can move towards minimizing the poaching levels on a constant basis for many years to come.

 

11. Considering the threats in Rhino poaching, what is a strategy the Government should adopt to give a national focus on the vulnerable status of Rhinos? 

Nationally, the Government must give all kind of support to the Assam Government, which appears to be keen on giving protection to Rhino and support its population growth. Giving teeth to the Rhino taskforce, investments and resources need to be provided to State Governments to strengthen their efforts. Further, the introduction of other non-governmental agencies like TRAFFIC and WWF to work together with state forces along with effective coordination between existing enforcement agencies is imperative in bringing a national focus on the status of Rhinos in India.



The Government can adopt an aggressive protection strategy by making available the highest level of intelligence to Assam Government and bringing in the army and ministry of home to work together with MOEFCC and Assam Government for making stronger strategies and anti-trade policies. Central government can also take up the matter with the Chinese Government with diplomatic discussions to curb the demand in their legal trade market. In a nutshell, aggressive cooperation and support should be given to Assam and Bengal for the protection of the Rhino.
