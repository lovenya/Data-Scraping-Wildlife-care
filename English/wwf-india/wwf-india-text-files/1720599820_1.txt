The brass city of Moradabad brought in the Wildlife Week in its true style with the installation of brass Hog Deer statuettes at the entrance of the Eco Park, with an aim to inspire citizens of Moradabad to take up the cause of Ramganga conservation. District Administration & Forest Department of Moradabad along with WWF-India brought in the Wildlife Week in the city with a series of planned awareness generation activities lined up for a week long celebrations. The day began with the official launch of the bird panel which showcases the photographs of prominent birds found in the Moradabad district along with the Ramganga documentary film by the chief guest, Shri Shankar Singh, Divisional Commissioner, followed by the release of the Ramganga Mitra logo along with Ramganga Mitra caps by the District Magistrate, Moradabad, Shri. Sanjay Kumar (IAS). 



WWF-India’s Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers programme has initiated Ramganga’s revival strategy in the city of Moradabad, in partnership with its District Administration. The revival strategy for the river envisions for communities, industries and Government to work together to bring the river back to life (improved ecological health). As part of the restoration plan, a mass awareness communication campaign has been devised with the focus on engaging diverse stakeholders to aspire for taking complete ownership, thereby becoming Ramganga Mitras.



“I welcome the Divisional Commissioner Moradabad, Shri Shiv Shankar Singh, Chief Conservator of Forest, Bareily, Shri M.P. Singh and other senior Forest Department officials including Shri Kamlesh Kumar & Shri Bomik Chandra Brahma, officers of WWF-India and dear students to Eco Park, Moradabad. Wildlife Week is of great significance as it tries to reiterate the importance of nature and wildlife in our daily living and the required reasons for its conservation. For the last eight months, with the support of WWF-India, District Administration of Moradabad has initiated ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’ Campaign. This campaign aims to engage with young adults, Government officials, schools and community members in developing strategies to restore the ecological wellbeing of the river, while making them Ramganga Mitras. On the occasion of the beginning of the Wildlife Week, let’s pledge today that we will reduce our consumption of polythene, will plant one sapling each year and ensure the conservation of water at our respective households!” said Shri Sanjay Kumar, IAS, District Magistrate.



Shri Shiv Shankar Singh, Divisional Commissioner Moradabad added, “District Administration of Moradabad is taking up the issue of the conservation of Ramganga on priority. To achieve our shared vision it is vital to mobilize young adult’s participation in conservation activities and develop a coordinated framework for collaboration between all stakeholders. I would like to congratulate the entire team of District Administration and Forest Department for taking up this noble initiative along with WWF-India. Hopefully, the documentary film screenings through the week will be able to generate awareness about Ramganga conservation among young students, thereby reaching out to their respective friends and family members. I would request you all to help the administration achieve its vision for a clean Ramganga. It is imperative to note that only clean water provides habitat to Dolphins. We should all aim to get Dolphins to Ramganga river in the city of Moradabad!”



The documentary film produced by WWF-India under its ‘Ramganga for Life, Life for Ramganga’ campaign aims to highlight the issues/challenges faced by Ramganga river and to inform/involve/engage diverse stakeholders, inspiring them to become friends of Ramganga river and take complete ownership of its ecological wellbeing. The students present at the event appeared enjoying the documentary film, especially after catching glimpses of the Ganga dolphin showcased in the movie. The movie makes the viewers travel across the river stretch, showcasing the various realities of Ramganga river. 



After the screening, day one of the week long celebrations witnessed painting competition for school children, between 6th to 8th grade, across 28 Government and private schools, including Kasturbha Gandhi and Indira Gandhi Schools. The painting exercise aimed to nurture emerging young talent in the city and to provide a platform for engaging them in Ramganga and wildlife conservation activities.



“At WWF-India we strongly believe that along with educating and creating awareness about wildlife among young people, it is critical to work with the Government and help them form policies and design strategies favouring solutions that address wildlife conservation issues in today’s changing scenarios. WWF-India’s Rivers for Life programme has devised detailed awareness generation activities as part of the Ramganga restoration plan that includes conducting Wildlife Week Celebrations, Ramganga Sansads, Block & District level meetings, River Trails, identifying Ramganga Mitras to inspire diverse communities living across Ramganga basin to take immediate actions for rivers conservation. Also, I would like to take this opportunity to extend gratitude for supporting the campaign and providing a coordinated framework for collaboration between all stakeholders”, added Mr. Suresh Babu, Director, River Basins & Water Policy, WWF-India.

The following days of the wildlife week celebrations will witness competitions on slogan writing, elocution on Ramganga Conservation along with quiz on Ramganga river and documentary film screenings till October 7, 2013.
