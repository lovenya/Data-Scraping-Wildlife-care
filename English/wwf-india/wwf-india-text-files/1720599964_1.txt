WWF-India empowers Pakke Tiger Reserve staff to conduct monitoring activities independentlyThe Pakke Tiger Reserve (TR), spread across the East and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh, is home to a small population of tigers. Historically, the reserve had been known to house several tigers, and this observation was finally confirmed in a study conducted in 2009-10. The study was a joint initiative launched under the NTCA-WII* All India Tiger Estimation Exercise, and was performed by WWF-India in collaboration with the State Forest Department through the use of capture-recapture methodologies. This was the first tiger estimation exercise that had ever been conducted in the reserve. 



Population estimation exercises serve to provide key data that help determine the overall conservation strategy in tiger reserves. Keeping a record of the population of tigers within a Protected Area (PA), as well as their gender, age and other statistics is not only helpful in developing the long-term conservation strategy, but is also beneficial for the protection of tigers from immediate threats such as poachers and human-wildlife conflict.WWF-India has been working with the staff at Pakke Tiger Reserve for the past five years, to help equip them to be self sufficient at conducting these important data gathering exercises.



The early part of this training, in 2009-10, was undertaken for the staff of Pakke and of Nameri, an adjoining tiger reserve in Assam. During the latter half of the training, in 2011-12, the joint monitoring exercises between Pakke and Nameri came to an end, as Nameri opted to monitor their tiger populations by themselves. That year onwards, the Pakke Tiger Reserve staff, with the help of WWF-India, carried out Phase IV of the tiger monitoring exercise. During the course of that exercise, nine individual tigers were photographed, along with other associated species. That session was especially significant as it included the first ever photo capture of a clouded leopard from this area. 



The following season, in 2012-13, the forest department procured camera traps, and Phase IV of the NTCA's tiger monitoring exercise was conducted, once again with the help of WWF-India. That year, however, only six individual tigers were camera trapped, along with other associated species. However, the session recorded the first ever photo captures of several other species including the Chinese pangolin, Himalayan serow, and a grey morph of the golden cat. In addition to the camera trapping exercises, the forest department also conducted prey estimation exercises, to determine the habitat's overall sustainability for tigers, in terms of the available prey in the area. 



Throughout these seasons, a series of comprehensive training workshops were conducted by WWF-India for the staff of Pakke Tiger Reserve. These workshops aimed to build capacity in several areas, including patrolling methods, the use of field equipment (GPS, range finder, compass and camera traps), sign and line transect survey techniques, camera trapping methods and daily maintenance and vegetation sampling. WWF-India also dispatched field biologists to the region, who were involved in field surveys, data analysis and report preparation of the tiger monitoring exercise over the years, with the help of the forest staff.



The following year, in November 2013, a refresher course, was conducted by WWF-India for Phase I, II and IV of the tiger monitoring exercise. Once again, the staff was successful in camera trapping six individual tigers along with other associated species. That year, the first ever photo captures of Himalayan goral in this area were obtained. 



“WWF-India has been instrumental in initiating and thereafter continuing the tiger estimation and monitoring exercise under NTCA in Pakke. They have provided us with regular field training on the various aspects of scientifically monitoring our tiger population. I am grateful that Pakke TR and WWF-India collaborated in this exercise for the past four years and extend my deepest thanks in this regard,” said Mr Tana Tapi, Divisional Forest Officer, Pakke TR.



Training the staff at Pakke Tiger Reserve to become self sufficient at these monitoring exercises is a significant achievement for WWF-India as it empowers the reserve to conduct long-term conservation planning and strategy, which is objective and based on facts and sound reasoning. Furthermore, it enables the reserve to continuously monitor the safety of its tigers and other species, and helps create a safe and sustainable habitat. 



“The role of WWF-India in tiger monitoring work acrossthe country was to build the capacity of forest staff to conduct the exercise on their own. Having helped the department in monitoring wildlife in Pakke Tiger Reserve since the year 2009-10, we have been successful in enabling them to conduct these annual monitoring studies by themselves, unlike many other tiger reserves of the country. They are now ready to play a significant role in working closely with the local communities for enhanced management and protection of the tiger reserve,” added Dr Anupam Sarmah, Head, Assam Landscapes, WWF-India.
