WWF-India along with UP Forest Department released turtle hatchlings into the Ganges after rearing them at the nursery for over 6 months
January 28, 2016, Meerut: More than 400 river turtle hatchlings were gently released by the community members of Meerut District at Maqhdoompur Ghat, at the banks of river Ganga, where these hatchlings have a better chance to survive. The release has been a part of a collaborative turtle conservation project, jointly initiated by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department along with WWF-India for last four years. The event was attended by Mr. Manish Mittal (IFS), Divisional Forest Officer – Meerut along with Superintendent of Police (Rural) Captain. M.M. Bai along with Dr. Asghar Nawab, a senior biodiversity expert from WWF-India.

“The joint efforts made by UPFD and WWF India in turtle conservation have shown great success.  Such vital conservation effort must continue on the wider scale covering more stretches of River Ganga,” stated Mr. Manish Mittal, IFS (DFO Meerut).



Capt. M. M. Baig, SP (Rural), added, “I happy to be a part of such wonderful turtle conservation programme. All communities must come forward for such conservation work. I congratulate all present – WWF India, Forest Department and Palage farmers for initiating turtle conservation in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary”..

The hatchlings, as old as 6 months were protected after WWF-India along with Uttar Pradesh Forest Department located a total of 57 turtle nests in the Palaze (riverbed) fields along a stretch of approximately 59 KM of the river bank in the area. 457 eggs were rescued from these nests. 38 riverbed farmers volunteered in locating these nests and also helped in the safe keeping of the eggs at the turtle hatchery formed on the banks f River Ganga at Makhdumpur village.

 

“I am delighted to be a part of such a conservation initiative. Now being aware of conservation and aesthetic value of biodiversity they are committed to its protection,” said Mr. Vinesh Kumar, a  local palage farmer of Maqhdoompur.



Till June 2015, a total of 419 turtle hatchlings hatched (92% hatching success). The species is Three Stripped Turtle Batagur Dhongoka, Brown Roofed Turtle Pangshura smithii, Indian Tent Turtle Pangshura tentoria circumdata. The hatchlings were transferred to the pond at the Hastinapur Forest training Centre where they were protected and looked after before being released into the wild.

 

“This event promotes the involvement of riparian communities (especially river bed cultivators) by encouraging community-led monitoring and conservation of turtle nests in their agricultural fields, ensuring a sense of ownership and desire for stewardship towards biodiversity conservation. Through this event we would also like to highlight the growing threats to these species and seek support from other districts which are closer to the river bank to unite in this conservation initiative. Local administration plays a vital role in ensuring that these engendered species receive the much required protection,” said Dr. Asghar Nawab, Senior Coordinator, WWF-India.



In the Upper Ganga River, a total of 12 species of freshwater turtles have been identified. Of these, 6 species are considered endangered and listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Although turtles have been accorded legal protection, the laws are not effective in the field and their exploitation goes unabated. Further depletion in turtle populations is mainly due to habitat loss which is largely due to Palage (riverbed cultivation) and collection of sand from nesting sites. This also leads to loss of turtle eggs; which are also predated upon by human, stray and wild animals. Freshwater turtles in India have received incidental protection in different sanctuaries specially created for crocodile conservation started since 1975. In this case, it is the re-introduction of Gharial and regular monitoring which will help thrive turtle species living in similar aquatic habitats and being conserved effectively.



In Hastinapur, WWF-India in collaboration with Uttar Pradesh Forest Department (UPFD) is already in its fourth year of Turtle Conservation Project, wherein more than 1000 turtle hatchlings have already been released into the Ganga.



WWF-India’s Rivers for Life, Life for Rivers programme envisions Ganga and Ramganga, one of its major    tributaries as healthy river systems that are rich in biodiversity, providing long term water security to communities and nature. As part of Ramganga’s restoration plan, the programme is working towards conserving 7 endemic & endangered species (Dolphins, Gharials, Otters, 3 species of freshwater turtles and Mahseer) which includes the freshwater turtles.
