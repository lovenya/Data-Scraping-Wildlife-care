New Delhi: WWF-India released a comprehensive report on the Environmental Flow (E-flows) requirement of the river Ganga at an event organised earlier today. Titled “Assessment of Environmental Flows for the Upper Ganga”, the report was released by G Mohan Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, in presence of government officials, academia, NGO and national and international experts.



In 2008, a team from WWF, along with key partners and experts initiated the task of examining and adapting existing global E-Flow methodologies to develop an appropriate approach for a river as complex as the Ganga. This involved integrating various aspects of the river – social and livelihood needs, cultural and spiritual requirements, hydrology and hydraulics, geomorphology, water quality and biodiversity values. The approach to assess E-Flows for the Ganga was developed based on the Building Block Methodology which had to be adapted to include the unique cultural and spiritual values of the river. This report captures the journey, the outcomes and the lessons gathered over the last four years of this work.



Mr. Mohan Kumar delivering his key note address said, “It is critical that that we must make water management multidisciplinary and concerns of all stakeholders must be addressed.” He added, “This assessment of E-Flows requirement by WWF-India lays foundation for developing a holistic view of basin management of not only Ganga but for other rivers as well.



Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, “We hope that this report will inspire and help different Union ministries including the Ministry of Environment & Forests and the Ministry of Water Resources, the State Governments, academics and civil society organizations, who wish to undertake E-flows assessment in other river basins.” 



As this was the first time that such a comprehensive E Flows assessment has been undertaken in India, and as the team was working with data constraints, there will need to be constant updating as new knowledge, information and understanding on river basins emerges.



The report has been authored by Jay O’Keeffe (Rhodes University, South Africa), Nitin Kaushal (WWF-India), Vladimir Smakhtin and Luna Bharati (IWMI, Sri Lanka).
