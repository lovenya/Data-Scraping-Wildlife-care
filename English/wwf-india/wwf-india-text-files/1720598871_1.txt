Kanpur: In association with Kanpur Nagar Nigam and ICLEI - South Asia, WWF-India’s Living Ganga Programme under HSBC Climate Partnership organized a capacity building and training workshop for staff of city’s utility providers – Kanpur Nagar Nigam, Jal Nigam and Jal Sansathan – with an aim to improve energy efficiency in water and sewage pumping and distribution system.



The two-day programme was inaugurated by Shri UN Tiwari, Additional Municipal Commissioner, Kanpur Nagar Nigam, in presence of staff from Jal Nigam, Jal Sansthan, WWF India and ICLEI-South Asia. 



The training programme is an outcome of the recent study – Energy Audit of Zonal Pumping and Sewage Pumping Stations of city of Kanpur – conducted by ICLEI-South Asia – WWF-India’s project partner – with the premise of promoting and advocating measures for co-management of water and energy in Kanpur, and details low cost/no cost to medium and high cost energy efficiency interventions that can be carried out in the existing water and sewage pumping systems. 



Shri UN Tiwari speaking to media said, “We hope that this training module increases awareness about issues that impact our water and sewage distribution system amongst our staff, and help us in positioning Kanpur as a model city.” 



Mr. Shirish Sinha, Head – Climate Change and Energy Programme, WWF-India, added, “It is heartening to acknowledge the response of the utility providers who have shown interest in implementing these recommendations which will increase efficiency in the electricity-water co-management distribution systems and bring energy and cost savings.”
