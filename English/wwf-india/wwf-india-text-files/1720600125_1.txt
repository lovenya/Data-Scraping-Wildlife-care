WWF-India to compile ‘toolkit’ for better managementA two-day workshop on the issue of human-wildlife conflict (HWC) was organized on 19-20 February 2015 by WWF-India with support from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC). The workshop was designed to engage with Indian Forest Service officials and brought to the fore several pertinent issues concerning HWC.



Titled ‘Issues Involved in Human-Wildlife Conflict’, the workshop was attended byforest officials from 13states, who interacted with wildlife experts, flagged concerns and actively discussed management measures and challenges concerning HWC. Among the participants were field managers, conservationists and prominent scientists.



The workshop commenced with a joint introductory session by Mr. Ravi Singh, SG& CEO, WWF-India and Dr. S. K. Khanduri, Inspector General of Forest (Wildlife), MoEF  & CC. Speaking on its contemporary relevance, Mr. Singh said, “This workshop is an attempt to take forward the organization’s idea of achieving conservation through continued partnerships of knowledge sharing. The policy discussions and the emanating research based evidences presented in the workshop will be important decision-making tools for the Government of India. WWF-India will work closely with the MoEFCC, the state Forest Departments of Government of India, Institutional partners and relevant stakeholders to take this initiative forward. One of the tasks will be to prepare a toolkit for prevention and management of human-wildlife conflict which will be a shared resource”. 

The workshop addressed three central themes -- the Science of HWC, Response to HWC and Policy aspects of HWC in India. On the first day, presentations were conducted by notable speakers including Dr. Khanduri and Mr. Ajay Desai. Mr. Desai discussed the role of science in dealing with conflicts and said: “Human-wildlife conflict, if not addressed effectively, will result in local communities questioning the forest department, thus eroding its authority to execute its primary task of protection of forests and wildlife.” 

 

Dr. Khanduri held an interactive session on the need to find a way of dealing with HWC within existing policies. He highlighted the fact that the focus of wildlife management continues to remain within the Protected Areas (PAs), though conflict occurs outside as well. Summing up, he said, “We need to introspect on the Wildlife Protection Act, other policies and the scientific knowledge to see how they can be used in conjunctions for better management of HWC.”



In the subsequent presentation,Dr.Yash Veer Bhatnagar, senior scientist at the Nature Conservation Foundation and India Director of the Snow Leopard Trust, described some innovative community-based solutions that have been adopted towards conflict mitigation in the Himalayan regions. He explained how the approach had succeeded through understanding the issues faced by local communities and participatory conflict mitigation approaches. Dr. Bhatnagar promoted a multi-pronged strategy towards HWC management aimed at minimizing losses, compensation, and targeted awareness initiatives. He said,“This workshop has been essential in helping participants from different part of the country share their experiences. I am looking forward to a follow-up ‘toolkit’ by WWF-India, which would encompass practical applications of these experiences.”



The workshop touched upon several other important conservation issues. ‘Response to Human Wildlife Conflict’, a presentation by Mr. Kaushik Baruah, founder and CEO of the Assam Elephant Foundation, stressed upon the importance of dealing with conflict in the backdrop of history of a region and an understanding of the entire ecosystem.



Mr. Samir Sinha, IFS, CCF and FD, Corbett TR, discussed the policy and legal perspectives on HWC with a special focus on Section 11 of WPA (1972), which specifies that "hunting of wild animals to be permitted in certain cases". The limitations and key points of this section were explained and discussed.



Amongst the participants, Ananda Banerjee, environment editor at Livemint and the Wall Street Journal, emphasized that it is crucial for media to regularly engage with forest officials, scientists, wildlife experts and other environment organizations for responsible reporting on HWC.



The session concluded with a presentation by Dr. Vidya Athreya, a wildlife biologist at Wildlife Conservation Society, on the importance of holistic management within and outside PAs. She recommended setting up rapid response teams, advertising helpline numbers, payment of quick compensation, improving communication processes between communities and forest departments and a pro-active and scientific approach towards resolving HWC.



Day two began with a keynote address by Dr. Mahesh Rangarajan, director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, on ‘Large Wild Animals and Humans in 21st Century India’.  He pointed out that HWC has been a historical issue and that the larger problem is artificial boundaries that humans create around nature.

 

WWF-India team members also presented numerous innovative and pragmatic approaches to manage HWC.  Dr. Anupam Sarmah, head of WWF-India’s Assam Landscapes delivered a presentation on community conflict management strategies conducted in the Sonitpur district of Assam, and on the importance of involving the local community along with the forest department. He described the effectiveness of trained kunki elephants to check human-elephant conflict, and highlighted the value of tools like early warning symptoms, night guard lights and fences that the region had experimented with.

 

Demonstrations of a few practical innovations like low-cost electric fencing and solar-based early warning systems were also presented by Mr.  N. Mohanraj, advisor, WWF- India.

 

Keeping with the key themes, a session to create a roadmap towards nationwide HWC management was also organized, chaired by Dr. Rajesh Gopal, IFS, Secretary General of the Global Tiger Forum.

 

The session saw the working groups frame a key set of recommendations on their respective themes. The Science group emphasized on lack of knowledge about the ecology and behavior of species, and urged the importance of conducting multi-disciplinary studies on HWC to develop better understanding and solutions for conflict management. 

 

The Policy group discussed bottlenecks in the existing policy framework and tried to align concerns of all stakeholders involved in prevention and response to conflict incidents.  The idea of enabling state governments to create species-specific management plans was also discussed.

 

The Response team dealt with discussing best practices for responding to HWC incidents such as ex gratia compensation and prevention mechanisms.

 

Following the group session, Dr. Dipankar Ghose, Director of Species and Landscapes programme, WWF-India, discussed the importance of continuous engagement in conflict issues. He said that the proceedings of the workshop with key recommendations will be submitted to MoEF CC soon.

 
WWF-India will now compile a toolkit containing various best practices, recommendations and solutions. A roadmap for HWC mitigation at a national level will be made. This kit will aim at helping equip policy-makers, forest departments and other stakeholders tackle HWC issues.
