Valmiki (Bihar): Evidence of three more species has been found in the once-neglected Valmiki Tiger Reserve during the past two months. A crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva), a yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula) and a Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar) were captured in camera traps placed by the Bihar Forest Department and NGOs WWF-India and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).



Yet another, a hoary-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus pygerythrus) was photographed earlier by WTI’s Regional Head for Bihar, Dr Samir Kumar Sinha. 



The crab-eating mongoose was photographed in camera traps placed by researchers of WWF-India and WTI. The yellow-throated marten and serow were captured in camera-traps deployed by WWF-India. The camera trapping by WWF-India was carried out as a part of the Phase IV monitoring exercise in collaboration with Department of Environment & Forests, Bihar and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Government of India.



WWF-India has been working in partnership with the Bihar Forest Department to monitor Valmiki’s tigers and with partners in Nepal is implementing a transboundary approach to conservation. The tiger monitoring work in Valmiki is part of the larger tiger survey being undertaken in India and Nepal across the entire Terai Arc Landscape for the first time. WWF-India is also supporting the efforts of the government to develop Valmiki as a tiger recovery site. WWF-India’s work in Valmiki is supported by WWF-UK and WWF-Sweden. Working with the Forest Department for a decade since 2003, WTI’s Valmiki Conservation Project helped establish presence of viable population of tigers here, bringing focus back to this formerly neglected tiger reserve in the mid-2000s. Currently, the Project, supported by US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) and Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT), carries out a multi-faceted approach to conservation, including studies on tigers and habitat recovery activities. The project also works with the communities involving them in conservation and reducing their dependence on forest resources, particularly within the villages in the Done valley that forms an incursion into the core of the Tiger Reserve. 



Santosh Tiwari, Field Director of the Tiger Reserve, said, “Over the last two months, we have discovered three new species only with the help of these camera traps. None of these four – including the squirrel – were mentioned in the latest faunal records published by the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), which mentions 53 species of mammals.”



“Valmiki has always been a paradise for wildlife,” said Dr Sinha. “When we started working here, there was hardly any information on Valmiki, even on the tiger. These discoveries only go on to prove that the TR once neglected is on a revival path with the joint activities by the Forest Department and NGOs in association with the communities who have been proactively contributing to this,” Dr Sinha said about these discoveries in the sole tiger reserve in the eastern state of Bihar. “We are excited by these discoveries. Valmiki has excellent potential for tiger recovery and given its contiguity with the Chitwan National Park in Nepal will be a critical site for undertaking transboundary approaches for tiger conservation. WWF will strengthen its partnership with the management of Valmiki and intensify conservation efforts,” said Dr. Dipankar Ghose, Director, Species and Landscapes, WWF-India. 



These species have been previously recorded in the neighbouring Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which forms the northern boundary of Valmiki Reserve. The ZSI has recorded 10 species of amphibians, 27 species of reptiles and 75 species of insects in Valmiki, including the gaur (Bos gaurus) and the Indian wild dog (Cuon alpinus), which are not found in rest of the Terai region in India. 



About the animals:

Crab-eating mongoose: The crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva), listed in Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (protection) Act, 1972, is a mongoose species found in a variety of habitats across northeast India and South-east Asia. Hunting affects localised parts of the global population. It is generally grey in color, with a broad white stripe on its neck extending from its cheeks to its chest.



Yellow-throated marten: The yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula) has a wide distribution, and evidently relatively stable population, across Asia. Also called honey dog for its fondness for sweet food, this mammal has a brown coat that darkens toward and on the tail, and its throat and chin are yellowish orange. It is listed in the CITES III appendix in India.



Himalayan serow: The Himalayan Serow (Capricornis thar) is a goat-antelope native to the Himalayas and Bangladesh, listed as ‘near threatened’ by the IUCN red list, due to hunting for food and habitat loss. Accounts from throughout the species' range report that it inhabits rugged steep hills and rocky places, but its population is on a steep decline. In appearance, the serow has a goat-like body with short limbs, and its coat is coarse and varies in colour from red to black with some white on the chest.



Hoary-bellied squirrel: The hoary-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus pygerythrus) is native to Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal, and widely distributed across this region. It is a diurnal and arboreal species that has often been recorded from gardens and plantations. It is listed in the Schedule II of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
