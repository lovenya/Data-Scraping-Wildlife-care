New Delhi: In its latest report, entitled ‘Strides to Success: A profile of successful innovators and active investors in the cleantech space’, WWF dwells upon a few innovators who have managed to establish themselves in the climate innovation ecosystem. In addition, the report also covers investors, both institutional, as well as foreign, including commercial banks, international and regional donors, venture capitalists, corporate investors and so on.



The report was launched today at the Climate Solver regional workshop, ‘Climate Solver+: Accelerating Cleantech Innovation in the SME sector in India’, organized by WWF-India, in partnership with The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry(SICCI), in Chennai.



This is one amongst a series of regional workshops held every year, as part of the expanded Climate Solver+ initiative, reaching out to cleantech entrepreneurs working on sustainable energy solutions, to enhance the outreach and scope of the platform. The workshop included representation from government, venture capitalists, incubation centres, SMEs, universities, financial institutions, industry associations and other ecosystem stakeholders from the southern region.



Climate Solver - WWF’s global innovation platform, recognizes transformative innovations in technology and business models that substantially contribute towards mitigating climate change and enhancing clean energy access. Over the last six years, the India chapter of this platform has recognized 19 promising innovators and conferred the Climate Solver award to them.



What makes the report extremely relevant is the fact that it showcases interesting case studies, wherein innovators have made compelling value propositions with sound financial plans, backed by robust business models, compelling investors to invest in these companies. In fact, this report can be used by early innovators to understand real life stories of successful innovators.



According to Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, 'Climate Solver initiative has endeavoured to accelerate the development and use of low-carbon technologies in India through multiple channels, including knowledge products. The report, Strides to Success, provides a comprehensive knowledge resource for aspiring entrepreneurs, showcasing successful innovators and active financiers in the climate innovation ecosystem.'



Notes to the Editor:

WWF's Climate Solver platform first began in Sweden in 2008 and launched in India in 2012 which further expanded to include countries like China and South Africa. WWF-India has been partnering with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship (IIM Ahmedabad), Indian Angel Network, National Innovation Foundation and Technology Development Board (Department of Science and Technology, Government of India) for the Climate Solver initiative. * Climate Solver: www.climatesolver.org * Climate Solver India page: http://goo.gl/9sP7kz * Climate Solver Hub : http://climatesolverhub.wwfindia.org/
