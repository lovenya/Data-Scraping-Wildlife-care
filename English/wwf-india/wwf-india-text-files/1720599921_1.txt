WWF-India releases summary report on key findings from previous RE reportsRenewables are no longer an “alternate energy”. They are indeed becoming the new normal. And India, as a nation, has a tremendous scope for establishing renewable energy (RE) as the primary energy source. The country is not just well endowed with diversified forms of renewable energy, such as, solar, wind, hydro and biomass, but also has very strong institutional systems to harness the RE capacity of the country.



The energy situation in India is very intricate because the country faces difficult challenges in meeting its energy needs and in providing adequate energy of desired quality in various forms in a sustainable manner and at competitive prices. More than 30 per cent of India’s population of 1.21 billion is now living in cities, and India is expected to top the world chart in urban growth for the next 40 years, bringing with it new challenges of providing energy and urban infrastructure for all. Fossil fuels have dominated the country’s energy scene for the last many years. 70 percent of our electricity is being generated by coal power plants, and the existing supply falls 10 per cent short during peak hours. In such a scenario, it is expected that there will be continued pressure on supply sources as well as the fiscal situation in the coming years.



This arouses a dire need to re-strategize the energy roadmap of the country, in view of high imports of fossil fuels (not only oil, but also coal in recent years) and the related energy security, environmental and financial issues.



This is where the renewables have come into the bigger picture. RE is gaining wide prominence in becoming a key solution to the nation’s energy needs. Renewables are also being increasingly viewed as critical for providing access to energy, particularly in rural areas through decentralized generation. Some of the RE technology is increasingly becoming cost effective and is now readily available.



Renewables as the new normal, a synthesis report, documents these very aspects. The report summarizes the key findings of the five RE reports that were prepared by WWF-India, in collaboration with various technical partners. It provides for an overall summative analysis and chalks out the specific conclusions based on all the reports. The report also encapsulates the main results drawn out of the specific reports and gives a sneak peek into the report launch events. 



The report advocates for a renewable energy-based pathway as the way forward. On the basis of the specific findings of the aforesaid reports, it can be inferred that over 90 per cent of the country’s total primary energy supply based on renewable sources can be met by 2050, provided several transformational changes are put in place. Also, multiple renewable sources will be required to make the shift to RE. Apart from technology, political will and a shared vision are the most critical prerequisites for development of 100 per cent RE scenario. Higher levels of global and regional cooperation can play a key role in accelerating the pace and spread of renewable energy development. Another key finding from the report is that aggressive efficiency improvements across the energy demand and supply sides have tremendous potential to reduce overall energy demand by about 59 per cent at the national level and about 60 per cent at the state level. The remaining demand can then be met by RE sources.



Dr T.S. Panwar, Director, Climate Change & Energy said, “WWF-India believes in the transformative potential of renewables to become the new normal and this report is a step forward towards this vision. The synthesis report aims to encapsulate the salient features of WWF-India’s various renewable energy reports for an easy and effective messaging that advocates for a just transition to renewables.” 



The five RE-based reports that have been summarized in this report encompass the national, state-level as well as district-level studies on renewable energy-based solutions. A focus on all the three levels provides for a holistic and lucid analysis of the renewable energy scenario in the country. These reports, prepared by WWF in association with various technical partners, include: The Energy Report – India: 100% Renewable Energy by 2050 (with TERI), The Energy Report – Kerala: 100% Renewable Energy by 2050 (with WISE), RE+: Renewables Beyond Electricity (with CEEW), Moradabad District Energy Plan and Mandla District Energy Plan (with Vasudha Foundation).
