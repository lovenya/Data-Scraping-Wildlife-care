WWF’s Regional Programme for Himalayan High Altitude Wetlands Conservation recently published a book containing the accounts of first hand climate witnesses from Ladakh and Sundarbans. 



Called Voices of Change: Stories from Ladakh and Sundarbans, this publication is a collection of real life accounts from the local people of Ladakh and Sundarbans who have observed, perceived, lost, grieved, and learnt to fear and cope with an environment which they can recognise or predict no more.



The documentation of these, it is hoped will help let their voices be heard and aid WWF in its work to coordinate a shift from a reactionary response from relevant government agencies to a more strategic one. Voices of Change: Stories from Ladakh and Sundarbans published
