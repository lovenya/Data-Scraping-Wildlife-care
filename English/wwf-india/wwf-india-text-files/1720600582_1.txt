New Delhi: Two Indian companies were today announced as the winners of WWF-India’s fifth annual Climate Solver Awards. The awards were presented by the Chief Guest, Sh. C. K. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Govt. of India. The two companies recognized - Atomberg Technologies Private Limited and Basil Energetics Private Limited - were conferred with WWF-India’s Climate Solver award under the GHG reduction category. With this year’s edition, the number of Indian entrepreneurs on the Climate Solver Platform stands at 17 among the 100 honoured entrepreneurs recognized from around the world. Additionally, three Indian Climate Solvers awardees in the past years - GPS Renewables, Clique Developments and Toro -have also featured in the top 100 Innovators listed in Sustainia100.



 Climate Solver is a global innovation platform that encourages innovations in technology and business models that contribute towards mitigating climate change and enhancing clean energy access. Started in Sweden in 2008 and in India in 2012, the Climate Solver initiative has now expanded to include countries like China and South Africa. WWF-India has been partnering with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), New Ventures India, Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship (IIM Ahmedabad), Indian Angel Network, National Innovation Foundation and Technology Development Board (Department of Science and Technology, Government of India) for the Climate Solver initiative.



The winning innovation by Atomberg Technologies is the energy efficient Gorilla ceiling fan which is based on Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor technology that consumes 65 per cent less electrical energy compared to conventional motor technologies. It serves as an excellent example of energy efficiency measures where technological intervention leads to substantial reduction of energy use without compromising on air delivery. 



Basil Energetics emerged as the winner for its renewable energy based smart micro-grid that provides a complete decentralized energy solution for urban and rural areas. It offers a solution to manage green power in the form of a package which not only includes standalone solar panels, but also includes a range of innovative hybrid household electrical appliances such as a ceiling fan, LED lights, air conditioner, refrigerator etc. The demand and supply of electricity is managed by a smart micro-grid which leads to direct utilization of solar power to run hybrid equipments, thereby eliminating the need for conversion from DC to AC whilst being energy efficient.



Speaking at the event, Mr. Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF-India said, “The Climate Solver platform compliments efforts of the government towards providing momentum to the innovation ecosystem in the country. Through this platform, year by year, we have been showcasing some of the best innovations emerging from the SME sector that are scalable, and have tremendous scope for mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing clean energy access to people living in remote and rural areas.''



 The award event was followed by release of a report titled “Clean Energy Innovation Ecosystem in the SME sector in India” jointly prepared by WWF-India and Okapi Research and Advisory. This report focuses on mapping the innovation ecosystem and analyses the challenges and opportunities that exist in the clean energy SME sector in India.



 In his address, Sh. C. K. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Govt. of India said, “An economy like India can never ignore SMEs, not just because of the numbers but also because of their contribution to the Indian growth story. Technological innovation has a key role in the scale up of the SME sector that would not only provide better environmental benefits but also ensure human well-being.”
