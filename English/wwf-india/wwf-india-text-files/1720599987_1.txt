Environment experts come together to enumerate river ecosystem and develop a framework to pilot valuation of Ganga ecosystem servicesNew Delhi: National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF), in association with National Institute of Ecology (NIE) and WWF- India inaugurated a two-day workshop on “Ecosystem Services of River Ganga”. The workshop focused on elaborating the concept of ecosystem services as applied to rivers, identification of most important ecosystem services of River Ganga (including tributaries) and developing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional program for their assessment and valuation. The workshop aimed for bringing together ecologists, environmentalists, academicians and economists to evaluate the ecosystem services of River Ganga. Enriching discussions amongst participants endeavored to define the concept of ecosystem servicers for river Ganga and approaches to be considered for evaluation of such ecosystem services. The workshop participants included representatives from different institutes/organizations like IITs, NIE, NMCG, ICAR, IWMI, World Bank, GIZ, IUCN, Australian High Commission, NGOs etc.



The inaugural session, which was attended by Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Joint Secretary and Mission Director NMCG, along with Shri Shashi Shekhar, Additional Secretary, MoEF and Mr. Ravi Singh, SG & CEO WWF-India, witnessed a key welcome address by Prof. D.K. Marothia, President, National Institute of Ecology (NIE) followed by Prof. Brij Gopal, of NIE. Prof. Dr. Brij Gopal highlighted that “Ecosystem services are the invisible drivers of the economy which are generally ignored. In order to further take up this study on ecosystem services, a brainstorming session is required and this study would be first of its kind for valuing the benefits derived by humans from river ecosystems. Finally, we also need to recognize the significance added by the tributaries to the ecosystem services provided by the Ganga.”



Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India in his inaugural address drew attention on critical issues like global decline in WWF’s living planet index by 31% since 1970s, undervaluation of ecosystem services, increased pressure on river ecosystems due to aggravated consumption pattern etc. “Evaluation of ecosystem services is a difficult task, and requires multidisciplinary hands for a successful completion of this enormous job”, added Mr. Singh. 



Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Joint Secretary MoEF & Mission Director, NMCG emphasized, “In our country, there has not been any systematic way of evaluating ecosystem services and such services are taken for granted. Collective wisdom would definitely help in developing a roadmap/framework for initiating a pilot on quantification and assessment of such ecosystem services.



Mr Shashi Shekhar, Additional Secretary, MoEF specified that a river which provides numerous services is usually considered only as a source of water, while the other services are neglected. A loss in economy due to reduction in these services from river Ganga has never been estimated. Unique ecosystem services that River Ganga provides, due to its unique properties have often been ignored and the focus has always been on consumption. Therefore, the estimation of benefits of these ecosystem services has become an urgent requirement.



The inaugural session witnessed a report release on the recommendations on the operationalization of Dolphin Action Plan 2010-2020 for the conservation of Ganges Dolphins, published by WWF-India and NMCG. The report captured the recommendations made during the three day workshop on “Operationalisation of River Dolphin Action Plan 2010-2020” from March 19-21, 2014 jointly organized by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and WWF-India. The workshop saw Dolphin experts from across the country participating to deliberate on key actions needed to implement the Dolphin Action Plan. The workshop outlined the roles and responsibilities of various organisations and departments at State and Centre, timelines, deliverables and budget to implement the Action Plan, which have been captured in the proceedings. 



The two-day workshop on “Ecosystem Services of River Ganga” observed deliberations on River Ganga as a unique ecosystem that provides various services, which contribute to the nation’s economy directly and indirectly. These included provisioning of services such as food and water; regulating services such as flood and disease control; cultural services such as spiritual, recreational, and cultural benefits; and supporting services, such as nutrient cycling, that maintain the conditions for life on Earth. Assessing of these ecosystem services with attempts at quantification and economic evaluation for rivers in India has been one the first of its kinds initiatives, aiming for to define the concept of ecosystem servicers for river Ganga and its relevance for related communities.
