Move for long term conservation of Tiger and other wildlife in India 



Nagpur: WWF-India has continued with its programme to strengthen tiger conservation in the country by providing two Bolero Camper vehicles to the Maharashtra Forest Department for use in Bor and Nagzira wildlife sanctuaries. The vehicles are provided specifically for anti-poaching and fire protection purposes in the above sanctuaries and will prove beneficial for their long term conservation. Forest fires in summer, among other threats, affect sanctuaries of Maharashtra’s Vidarbha region. 



The vehicles’ keys were handed over to Mr.A.K.Joshi, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) - Wildlife, Maharashtra Forest Department by Mr.Samir Sinha of WWF-India at a function here today. Dr. Nand Kishore, CCF, Wildlife – Nagpur, Mr. A.K.Saxena, CCF, and Mr.Khetrepal, CCF (Nagpur) were present on the occasion.



Bor and Nagzira are among the many important areas of wilderness scattered along Maharashtra’s borders with Madhya Pradesh and support a rich array of wildlife. These sanctuaries, apart from harbouring tigers, are connected by forested corridors to bigger wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. While Bor has a forest corridor with Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in south-west, Nagzira is connected to Pench Tiger Reserve in north-west and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in south-east. These corridors ensure unhindered migration of wildlife from one protected area to another.



Together, along with those in Andhra Pradesh to the south, these forests provide the biggest contiguous habitat for the Tiger in India. Hence, it is critical that these sanctuaries together with their corridors are afforded strict protection to save the Tiger and other wildlife. In this direction, WWF-India and TRAFFIC, along with Maharashtra Forest Department, are organising a 2-day training workshop on wildlife law enforcement. It is being held at Nagpur on 1st and 2nd August and will involve officials of important tiger areas of Maharashtra. The aim is to strengthen capacity of the frontline wildlife staff and their managers in wildlife law enforcement. Here, training will be imparted on wildlife forensics, effective implementation of wildlife law, use of metal detectors and protocols on collection of wildlife samples for forensic analysis. TRAFFIC will also be giving out a wildlife forensic kit developed by them with Wildlife Institute of India. This kit facilitates scientific collection of samples for forensic examination. Training will also be given to the officials to use the kit.



It can be noted here that TRAFFIC has, in past, helped Maharashtra’s Melghat Tiger Reserve by distributing metal detectors for anti-poaching surveillance like detection of traps. The same is also being extended to staff of Pench and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserves during this workshop.
