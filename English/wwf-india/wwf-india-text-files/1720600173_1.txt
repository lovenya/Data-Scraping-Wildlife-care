NEW DELHI: ‘Linear Infrastructure - Mitigating Impacts in WWF Landscapes’, an international workshop hosted by WWF India from April 16-18, addressed the impacts of the fast developing road and rail networks on the wildlife of several Asian countries.



On the first two days, the workshop brought together stakeholders including government officials, engineers, economists, corporate bodies and environmental experts from India and six other Asian Tiger Range Countries (TRCs) where wild tigers are found, and discussed possible mitigation measures to ensure that infrastructural development does not lead to further fragmentation of wildlife habitats and corridors.



Government and forest department officials from Nepal, Malaysia, Indonesia and India participated in the event where WWF representatives from Nepal, Bhutan, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, India and Myanmar (on Skype) presented case studies from their respective landscapes and initiated dialogue.



Delegates felt that authorities across nations were increasingly acknowledging the need for protecting animal passages in the face of rapid development. It was agreed that practical solutions needed to be developed, based on strong engagement with government agencies, financial institutions and the public. The team also unanimously identified the need to include environmentally sound infrastructure designs, right at the initial planning stage of any project rather than having these discussions after projects had been formulated and budgets sanctioned.



Highlighting the need for more strategic and coordinated efforts to address the impacts of infrastructure on the natural environment, Dr.Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF India said, “This workshop endeavors to bring together key stakeholders involved in linear infrastructure development in a dialogue with conservation partners to design strategic approaches for mitigating linear infrastructure impacts on sensitive wildlife habitats.”



On the third day, delegates from India and Nepal, including road and railway officials, scientists, engineers, the Uttar Pradesh State Forest department, research institutions like the Wildlife Institute of India and WWF members, together reviewed the various linear infrastructure projects along Indo-Nepal border which pass through the wildlife habitats within the Terai Arc Landscape. 



A series of re-alignments and inclusion of appropriate animal passages has already been suggested by a joint group comprising the Uttar Pradesh State Forest Department, Public Works Department (PWD) and WWF-India for the upcoming Indo-Nepal border road (also known as SSB road) within India. It was agreed that the linear infrastructure planned on the Nepal side (the Hulaki road, a railway line and power transmission structures) should all be aligned for mitigation efforts to be effective. Based on this, the team initiated a dynamic, joint work-plan to address impacts.



The participants also discussed organizing joint workshops for engineers and technical experts to sensitize them to environmental safeguards. The teams unanimously agreed that appropriate mitigation of impacts along the linear infrastructure on both sides of the Indo-Nepal border is possible only if the two countries worked in a synchronized manner. For future reference, the importance of putting a value on nature and involving conservation scientists and engineers to collaborate at the design phase of any infrastructure project were stressed upon.
