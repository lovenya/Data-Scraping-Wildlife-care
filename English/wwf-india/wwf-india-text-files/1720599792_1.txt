In 2013, Oxford Bookstore and WWF-India joined hands for an innovative and exciting umbrella partnership. Oxford Bookstore, a part of the 100-year-old conglomerate – Apeejay Surrendra Group, has a chain of 26 bookstores across India. The bookstore, a treasure trove of knowledge, also houses the Cha Bar, a tea café, though tucked away, is an integral part of the bookstore.



Oxford Bookstore is supporting WWF-India’s rhino conservation work in the north-east of India and the WWF-India Wild Wisdom Quiz programme. Every time a customer drinks a cup of Assam tea, at the Cha Bar, the proceeds of the sales will directly contribute towards saving the one-horned rhino. Oxford Bookstore has also agreed to match these donations.



WWF-India has also joined hands with Oxford Bookstore for the Give Back To Nature programme. Every a transaction at Oxford Bookstore, will contribute towards supporting the Wild Wisdom Quiz, an education awareness programme. 



Oxford Bookstore has created the WWF-India Green Corner where WWF-India’s conservation products will be available to its customers.



Both WWF-India and Oxford Bookstore will host special innovative events on ‘Conservation Saturdays’ to create awareness on environmental issues. 



This partnership gives WWF-India a chance to reach out to the right audience and as Mr Ravi Singh, Secretary General and CEO, WWF-India said, “WWF-India welcomes the partnership with Oxford Bookstore to support the conservation initiatives in India. The partnership will also support our Rhino Conservation Programme and the Wild Wisdom Quiz. Further, we will together reach out to many individuals of the younger generation, through the medium of books and small programmes to make for a better natural environment.” 



The partnership which began as a pilot at Oxford Bookstore, New Delhi, has now expanded to eleven stores and eight Cha Bars across the country. 



Ms Madhur Das, Directo¬r – Conservation Alliances, WWF-India said that, “WWF-India values the partnership with Oxford Bookstores as this association provides a common platform for spreading the message of conservation. Through a series of joint events, campaigns and workshops, the bookstore will become a hub of learning.” 



“The formats we have brought in through the alliance will enable a variety of people to join in the efforts to conserve and restore natural resources and animals that people love and enjoy so much in our spectacular land of forests," said Ms Priti Paul, Director – Apeejay Surrendra Group.



Together the WWF-India and Oxford Bookstore Conservation Partnership aims towards raising funds, public consciousness and sharing responsibility towards one-horned rhino conservation in Assam. Oxford Bookstore and WWF-India
