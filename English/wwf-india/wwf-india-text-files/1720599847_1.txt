Keeping track of the 35,000+ species listed under CITES has now been made easier through the development of an online database-driven Checklist of CITES species. This state-of-the-art electronic resource provides users with an intuitive interface where queries can be made using not just scientific or common species names but also CITES Appendices, countries or regions, and any combinations thereof. The display of results can be further refined by selecting criteria such as synonyms or authors' names. Users can thus produce a tailored Index of CITES species listing, for instance, all CITES species occurring in a specific country. The history of listing is displayed on screen for each taxon and can be printed off in a single document covering all taxa.



CITES Secretary-General John E. Scanlon, in his comments during the launch of the Checklist, stated: “This new database-driven Checklist of CITES species will enable CITES Parties to better ensure legal and sustainable trade in wildlife. When used with other information systems, users can create new tools that will offer better insights on how to conserve CITES species and use them in sustainable manner ”.

This database-driven Checklist was developed for CITES by UNEP-WCMC using data from the CITES species database. The Secretariat is working with UNEP-WCMC on other cutting-edge information tools that will make use of data from the Checklist.
