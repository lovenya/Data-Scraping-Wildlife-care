Delhi begins Copenhagen countdown



New Delhi: An melting ice sculpture, symbolically calling all for action and placed by a coalition of climate groups on a map of the world, melted fast on the Delhi grass, warning that the world as we know , would be washed away if glaciers melt because of climate change.



The melting sculpture marked the start of the 100-day countdown to the United Nations Copenhagen Climate Summit, and the launch of the TckTckTck campaign, which is urging governments to agree a fair, binding and ambitious deal at the summit. At the same time, ice sculptures of 100 children are being unveiled at the Temple of Earth in Beijing, symbolising the vanishing future of the more than a billion people in Asia who are threatened with water shortages by the changing climate.



The Delhi sculpture has been put up by the Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA), a coalition of groups fighting climate change. Greenpeace China Climate Campaigner Li Yan, who was present at the CANSA press conference, urged India and China to work together on climate protection. Li urged that the two countries establish a truly low-carbon sustainable development model, and that the developed countries contribute to achieving this goal.



Sanjay Vashist of CANSA said: “The developed nations have committed up to 16 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to the levels in 1990. This will not halt the rise in temperature above 4 degree Celsius, which will have serious consequences for the earth.” One such consequence is the rapid melting of glaciers which jeopardises the water supply for 1.3 billion Asians who live in the watershed of the seven great rivers that originate in the Himalayas.



People affected by the changing climate in different parts of India gave testimonies at the conference, under the aegis of the Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group, the Ekta Parishad, the Himalaya Pariyavaran Shiksha Sansthan, and Marag.



 "The poor in developing countries suffer the most from climate change. Changing temperatures and erratic rainfall are already affecting agricultural yields. Women, who provide food, water and fuel for their families, are the hardest hit. If left unchallenged, future climate impact would threaten the survival of millions," said Aditi Kapoor, of Oxfam.



“The challenge today is far broader than just emission reductions, it a challenge of meeting development objectives within the constraints of climate change. We need strong action on climate change where everyone comes together as time is ticking away,” concluded Shirish Sinha of the WWF.
