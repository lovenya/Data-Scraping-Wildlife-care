WWF-India supports dairy unit for a community in Assam



Background

Like hundreds of other settlements the small Madrijhar village, at the foothills of Eastern Himalayas, dots the fringes of Assam’s Manas National Park that shares its border with Bhutan. Under the administration of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), the population of this village is a mix of various ethnicities - Bodos, Assamese and Adivasis, with the former being in majority. A survey here by WWF-India in 2009 revealed over 50% of the population being economically weak and classified to be ‘below the poverty line’ as per government criteria.  



The income of the residents here is mainly generated from two sources - agriculture and forest produce. Recognizing the need to generate alternative employment for the villagers WWF-India’s team from North Bank Landscape (NBL), in which the area lies, began regular interaction with them in 2009 in collaboration with Manas Ever Welfare Society (MEWS). To provide them with a livelihood that does not depend on forests, WWF and MEWS recently helped construct a ‘Dairy Development Unit’ in the village. This activity is a part of the initiative Indian Rhino Vision (IRV) 2020, which aims to increase the Rhino population in Assam to 3000. 



Supporting alternative livelihood 

This dairy unit was formally inaugurated on 22 September, 2010 by Sri. Debajit Bora, Sub Divisional Officer (SDO) of Salbari Division in Baksa district, along with Manas Park authorities and other local dignitaries. Members of MEWS played a pivotal role in setting up the unit especially the construction of a shed, which was done as per the technical guidelines provided by the Gobardhana Development Block. The construction took place on a plot of community owned land covering an area of 700 sq. m. The funds for this were provided through Bodoland Territorial Council by the Assam Government. WWF–India organised a training for MEWS members by arranging an exposure visit to Astha’s Nature’s Home, who have prior experience in dairy farming in Assam’s Bongaigaon district. A 15 member committee was formed to implement the unit under the supervision of WWF-India and MEWS. The unit presently has two improved varieties of milch cows and two calves. The park authorities provide necessary veterinary care to ensure they are healthy. The people involved in the unit are trained and sensitized to the fact that grazing inside the national park is detrimental to the wildlfie. Representatives of MEWS and WWF-India regularly visit the unit to monitor it. The awareness meetings are having an effect on communities living at the forest fringes and a small percentage of these have actually sold off their less productive cows in support of conservation, hoping that an external agency will help them set-up a dairy unit with improved varieties of cows.



Boosting communities’ morale

In the initial phase, 15 households are being targeted to benefit from the project. WWF-India aims for this small unit to grow into a fully developed one that will support the livelihoods of all the residents of this village, further bringing down dependency on forest produce hence contribute directly to the conservation of the wilderness of Manas. Setting up of this unit has boosted the confidence of the residents who hope this will strengthen their village economy. This has also strengthened their faith in the government and other agencies. They now look forward to be involved in similar livelihood activities to uplift their lifestyles. It has been a challenge but still a satisfactory experience for WWF’s NBL team to work with the community on this project. This might be an example for other communities around Manas and even beyond, to earn their livelihoods without depending directly on forests and hence contribute to conservation.
