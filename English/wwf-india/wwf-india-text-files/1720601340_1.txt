India, 25th March 2023: Over the last 17 years, the lights-off moment has seen entire streets, buildings, landmarks, and city skylines go dark - an unmissable sight that drew public attention to nature loss and the climate crisis. This Earth Hour, across India, we witnessed various landmarks participating in the global switch-off to celebrate #BiggestHourforEarth

 

Some landmarks that stood in solidarity with Earth Hour 2023 by switching off their lights were:

Earth Hour 2023 urges people and communities across the world to take an hour to create a global moment of change. As landmarks and homes across the planet take part in Earth Hour’s iconic switch-off, we are asking everyone to ‘switch off’ themselves by taking a break from their routine and everyday distractions and spending 60 minutes doing something positive for our planet and nature around us.



Earth Hour celebrated this year on 25th March, is the largest global grassroots movement for the environment. The aim is to create an unstoppable movement for nature to recognise the role of individuals in creating solutions to the planet’s most pressing environmental challenges and harnesses the collective power of its millions of supporters.
