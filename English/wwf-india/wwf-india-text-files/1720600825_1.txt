Diverse set of stakeholders come together as stellar example for community-led wetland conservation
 Bangalore Rural District, Karnataka, 01 July 2019: According to The Global Wetland Outlook 2018 the loss of wetlands is three times faster than that of natural forests. However, the Bashettihalli wetland stands out as a stellar example of contrast. A story of continuous and concerted efforts, the Bashettihalli wetland has been rejuvenated as an outcome of a three-year wetland conservation initiative by WWF-India, supported by NOKIA in association with a multi stakeholder committee comprising communities, industries, gram panchayat members, under the leadership of the Bangalore Rural District Administration. The team came together today to celebrate the rejuvenation of Bashettihalli wetland, covering an area of 48.18 acres in the industrial town of Doddaballapura.

                                                                                                                                                             

WWF-India, with the support of NOKIA and the committee has been working towards conserving the Bashettihalli wetland since 2016 through a multi-pronged approach including social mobilization, awareness creation and technical interventions. While wetlands across the country have been drying up due to a range of issues, the Bashettihalli wetland rejuvenation story highlights the impact that multiple stakeholders can have when they come together to address a common goal. This initiative in Bashettihalli is a pioneering example of positive impact achieved through diverse partnerships and collaborations.

 

The multi-stakeholder committee implemented the restoration of 1.7 km of channels connecting upstream wetlands (Arrenehalli-Guddhalli) with Bashettihalli. A 5 square km catchment area was restored through plantation of over 1000 native saplings, following the removal of 1,90,000 cubic meters of silt, de-weeding and strengthening of bunds, which commenced on World Water Day in March, 2019. The project concluded in June 2019 with water flowing again in the Bashettihalli wetland.

 

The wetland rejuvenation plan was drawn up by WWF-India and endorsed by the multi-stakeholder committee. The District Administration, along with WWF-India and NOKIA partnered with the Bashettihalli Gram Panchayat, Doddaballapura Industries Association, Indena India Pvt Ltd, Jyothi Fabricare Services Limited and Mushashi Auto Parts India Pvt. Ltd. to implement the rejuvenation plan.

 

Mr. Karee Gowda, IAS, Deputy Commissioner & District Magistrate, Bangalore Rural District said, "Bashettihalli wetland is critical to the lives of thousands of people in the area with over 12,000 people and 40 industrial units dependant on the wetland.  I am happy to have been able to spearhead the very active multi-stakeholder committee to help revive the wetland and its catchment area in Doddaballapura. This is a good example of collective action where local communities have come together with industries for better water management”.”

 

“The Gram Panchayat has been supporting all the initiatives of WWF-India from the beginning of the programme like plantation drives, cleanliness drives, water quality assessments and biodiversity surveys. We are happy to be a part of the multi-stakeholder committee for conservation of Bashettihalli wetland. We are committed to the maintenance of the wetland and its catchments. It is critical for our lives and for the birds,” said Mrs. Narayanamma President, Gram Panchayat, Bashettihalli, Doddaballapura.



“Wetlands are ecosystems supporting critical ecosystem functions while also being very important for biodiversity.  The lakes of Bengaluru form a chain of hydrological connections, with surplus water from upstream lakes flowing further, forming a chain of reservoirs. The highlight of this journey has been the involvement and engagement of a diverse set of stakeholders who also recognised the need to restore the upstream wetlands to ensure water connectivity to Bashettihalli.,” said Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF – India.

Apart from the Bashettihalli wetlands, WWF-India in partnership with NOKIA, is also working towards conserving the Madiwala wetland by adopting an integrated approach for wetland conservation.
