New Delhi: A study highlighting low carbon policies and interventions across various sectors in 10 states of India was recently launched by WWF-India at an event held on 30th April 2013 in New Delhi. 



The Low-Carbon Growth Policy Tracker for Indian states has been developed by WWF- India with technical inputs from Ernst & Young LLP. It assesses low-carbon policies across states in the country, evaluates their effectiveness in reducing GHG emissions across all major sectors and encourages new policies promoting overall low-carbon transformation and development at the state level. The low carbon policy tracker for India has been prepared on the lines of the European Union climate policy tracker initiated by WWF-International in 2010. It is being rolled out, in the initial year, in ten Indian States, across eight sectors (Power, Transport, Industry, Buildings, Waste, Agriculture, Forestry and general sector) and assesses states on a total of 60 indicators, both qualitative and quantitative.



“The current work adds to the knowledge base on good policies and practices that promote low-carbon development. It is intended to stimulate positive action among states and encourage best practices as well as to raise the level of ambition among them.” Said Mr. Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF India 



The tracker results revealed that out of the 10 states analyzed, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as top performers, rated “C”, on a 7 point scale ranging from A to G, with “A” being the highest. Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan ranked in the “D” category, while Arunachal Pradesh was categorized as “E”. Apart from state performance indicators, the tracker also highlights leading sustainable practices and national-level policies that have promoted low-carbon transformation and yielded positive results at state level. 



In future, the tracker could act as a barometer to measure the progress of state and central policies designed to achieve low-carbon growth. As more quantitative data becomes publicly available, the indicators can be further refined and the progress across sectors can be mapped better in terms of the impact of the policies.
