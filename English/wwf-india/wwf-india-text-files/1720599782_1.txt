At the very outset, let me thank you dear donors, for your invaluable contribution to WWF-India. It is your support and encouragement that energizes us in our conservation mission. 



This issue of the donor newsletter brings to you news and updates about some of our work. These include the fascinating success of the cattle compensation scheme to reduce the retaliatory killing of tigers, and the rescue of a rhino calf, orphaned by poaching. One of the initiatives this quarter was the development of a carbon policy tracker to highlight low carbon policies in India. Low carbon policies are those policies that have minimal output levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The steady increase of these GHGs due to human activity has a direct and adverse bearing on climate change. We also bring you details of Earth Hour, 2013, an annual global campaign of WWF, towards a sustainable future. 



We hope you enjoy this issue and look forward to your continued support to the cause of nature conservation. 



Sincerely, 

Karan Bhalla
