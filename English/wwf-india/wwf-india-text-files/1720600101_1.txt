People’s Perception Study- Renewable Energy in India 2014

New Delhi: WWF-India today held a public discussion on understanding perceptions and solutions on renewable energy. The open house was attended by representatives from RWAs, practitioners, media, students, teachers, government, civil society and renewable energy manufacturers. The discussion highlighted the barriers people face in shifting to alternative energy and offered possible solutions in adopting renewable energy solutions. The forum also saw the release of the report - People’s Perception Study: Renewable Energy in India 2014. A user-friendly booklet titled Renewables for Lifestyle Shift, that encapsulates basic information on various renewable energy applications in India, was also launched at the event.

 

The People’s Perception Study showed that nearly 55% people surveyed haven’t used any renewable energy applications but more than 95% of them are willing to adopt renewables, if given the right opportunity. Solar energy is perceived to have a high potential in India by about 92% of people surveyed, with solar water heaters appearing as the most popular RE application. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) is the most well known government initiative among individuals, though 68% people were not able to name any policy or scheme.

 

A common perception, as per the study, highlighted the fact that renewable solutions are expensive and do not meet total energy demands. 68% of the respondents consider the high initial cost of RE technologies as a barrier to their willingness to invest in such technology. Operational and capital costs and lack of consumer awareness are some of the challenges faced by manufacturers. Access to readily available information is a huge barrier for both people to adopt renewables as well as manufacturers to promote their products. A need for a collaborative effort has also been identified by 69% of the surveyed people, who believe that all the stakeholders– governments, institutions, government organizations, NGOs and individuals – must together take the lead in promoting RE adoption.

 

Talking about the scope and need for Renewable Energy in India, Mr. Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF-India said, “India is proactively announcing ambitious renewable energy targets and citizens are more eager than ever to know and learn about alternative energy options. Through these two publications, WWF-India attempts to understand perceptions, present solutions and encourage a positive dialogue among people to initiate the shift to cleaner and more sustainable forms of energy. Through a public engagement such as this, we try and demystify renewable energy and bring it closer to people.”
