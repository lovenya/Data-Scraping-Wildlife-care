The Boom-Brahmadev corridor is located between the Haldwani Forest Division in India and the Kanchapur Forest Division in Nepal.It serves as a critical passageway for wildlife including elephants and tigers from the Nandhaur Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttarakhand to the Churia Hills in Nepal.Since 2004, the expansion of human settlements around the Kanchapur Forest Division, Nepal has resulted in frequent incidents of human-wildlife conflict in nearby villages such as Thawal Khera and Uchouli Goth on the Indian side of the corridor.



To plan transboundary efforts for the restorationofthe health of the corridor, WWF-India’s  Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) Office organized a field-level meeting on 2ndDecember 2014 between the Nepalese and the Indian forest departments.The meeting was attended by numerous officials fromthe Haldwani Forest Division, Terai East Forest Division,Uttarakhand and the Kanchanpur Forests and Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve,Nepal. Among the senior forest officials present there wereMr Bed KumarDhakal, Chief Warden, Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, MahenderNagar; Mr Pashupati Nath Koirala, District Forest Officer, Kanchanpur,Mahender Nagar; Mr Pushkar Bahadur Singh, Chairman, Buffer Zone, CouncilShuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve; Mr Parkash Arya, Deputy Director Nandhaur WLS; Mr Rajesh Kumar Srivastav, Terai East Forest Division and Dr Harish Guleria, Head, Terai Arc Landscape, Uttarakhand, WWF-India.



The meeting concludedsuccessfully with both sides arrivingat several  strategic and vital decisions. The officials from Haldwani Forest Division and Kanchanpur Forest Division agreed to plan joint initiatives to restore the functionality of the Boom-Brahmadev corridor and work with local communities to minimize incidents of human-wildlife conflict in the area. Furthermore, a joint document would be prepared that identifies patterns of wildlife movement, records threat analysis and provides possible routes for the restoration of the corridor.

 

Officials from both India and Nepalintend to workin concert with the local communities of Khallvillage in the Kanchanpur Forests and the Thawal Khera village on the Indian sidetoimplement these plans. Significant information on various ecological, socio-economic, and conflict aspects were discussed in the meeting, including the usage of traditional routes by elephants from Kilpura-Khatima Forests toMelaghat and Chandni Dhaudhra.The meeting was followed by a field visit to the critical bottleneck region of the Boom-Brahmadev corridor. This corridor is of great significance because it allows a safe passage for wildlife from the Nandhaur Landscape to the Kanchapur Forests.

 

Safeguarding wildlife that use the Boom-Brahmadev corridor as a transitional routeis an important step towards wildlife conservation in the Terai Arc landscape, and requirescooperation between India and Nepal to succeed. To ensure a consonant existence between humans and wildlife in the region, the preservation of the corridor’s health is of vitalsignificance.
