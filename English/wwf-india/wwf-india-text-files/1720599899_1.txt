New Delhi – India can achieve a low-carbon development pathway, with appropriate policies being implemented, without significantly decreasing development ambitions, according to a report released today by a consortium of partners that included WWF-India, CEE, Laya, CASA and Welthungerhilfe, at IIC, New Delhi. 



This is a first of its kind study to integrate development concerns in a climate modeling framework. The study provides important insights for the Indian low-carbon development policy debate. IRADe, as the technical partner, has developed a visionary development scenario till 2050, which is based on meeting a development threshold that accounts for human well-being indicators. On this foundation, two India-specific low-carbon development scenarios are overlaid, based on a calculated carbon budget for India on per capita equity basis. The mitigation measures required under this scenario lead to lower per capita CO2 emissions in 2050, from 13.1 tonnes in the visionary development scenario to 5 tonnes and 4.1 tonnes in the two low carbon scenarios considered. These low carbon scenarios are consistent with the goal to end poverty and to promote sustainable development. A major conclusion of the study is that the visionary development pathway does not involve any significant cost compared to business as usual scenario, and also attains the threshold values of well being indicators sooner. The study, thus, has the potential to play a critical role in advancing political and public discourses on integrated climate change mitigation and development in India.



The study emphasises increasing the investment in development goals, especially on sectors such as education and health; scaling up of renewable energy, and bringing energy efficiency to a level where it is able to meet its full potential in various sectors. The study also suggests that expansion of low-cost mitigation options, innovative solutions, and indigenous, decentralised energy options will aid in rapid infusion and leapfrogging from the conventional fossil fuel-based pathways. 



One of the findings that generated significant discussion during the launch event was the concern regarding compromising the GDP in order to stay within the carbon budget, though the development goals and well being indicators are still attained. This would have technological and financial implications. It was also pointed out that GDP and well-being can be decoupled such that higher development indicators can be achieved without a correspondingly high GDP. It was agreed that this topic needs further research.



Mr. Michael Kuehn, Policy Adviser, Welthungerhilfe, on the occasion said, "One thing is clear, India needs to reach its development goals to overcome poverty successfully. Through the study, it is evident that the fight against poverty can be combined with low carbon pathways. Climate protection doesn’t have to be a killer for development options!"



Speaking on the necessity of making the transition to a sustainable low carbon pathway, Dr. Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF-India said, “This report is an important starting point for the debate on linking development thresholds, well being and low carbon options for India. There needs to be greater understanding on how India can adopt a low carbon pathway and the implications of this on development aspirations.” 



The report, Low-Carbon Development Pathways for a Sustainable India therefore attempts to provide a larger vision and direction for the paradigm shift to low carbon options by the middle of the century while meeting the development objectives and reduction of poverty.
