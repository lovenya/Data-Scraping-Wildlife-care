New Delhi: On 10 September 2011, India honored two courageous men who fought all odds to revive and protect tiger populations in the country. 



Shri R. Sreenivasa Murthy, Chief Conservator of Forests and Field Director, Panna Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh and Shri Tana Tapi, Divisional Forest Officer, Pakke Wildlife Sanctuary Assam received WWF-PATA’s Bagh Mitra Awards 2011 at a function hosted by the Ministry of Tourism, Govt. of India at Hotel Ashok, New Delhi. 



WWF-PATA Bagh Mitra Awards, jointly instituted by WWF-India and Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), aim to acknowledge individuals and institutions/community groups for their leadership and transformative contribution to conserve India’s wild Tigers and their habitats. 



Shri R. Sreenivasa Murthy was acknowledged for his enduring efforts to reintroduce and revive the tiger population at Panna Tiger Reserve. At a time when Panna had lost all its tigers and the staff morale was low, Shri Murthy took on the challenge to bring tigers back to the Reserve. Two tigresses had already been introduced to Panna and Shri Murthy helped translocate another tigress and a male tiger. By ensuring proper monitoring and protection, Panna Tiger Reserve soon achieved breeding success. Shri Murthy not only helped Panna restore its pride but also helped rekindle the lost spirit of this forest.







Shri Tana Tapi received this prestigious award for his exemplary work to restore and secure the Pakke Wildlife Sanctuary. Despite numerous challenges including armed militancy, poachers and other criminal elements, Shri Tapi was successful in upscaling anti-poaching efforts in this area. Such personal threats and limitations of human resources and other infrastructure never deterred him from working hard to protect tigers of Pakke as also their habitat and other associated species. During the last two years, he has constructed 40 anti-poaching camps and arrested several poachers. 





Mr Ravi Singh, Secretary General & CEO, WWF-India said, “WWF-PATA Bagh Mitra Awards are a medium for us to recognize the Tiger heroes of our country as well as an opportunity to celebrate India’s wild tigers and acknowledge the incredible efforts involved in protecting and conserving them for future generations”. 



He further added, “Tiger is the national animal of our country and to protect it is every individuals’ responsibility. WWF-India recognizes this need to save the species in the wild and has partnered with PATA India Chapter for this prestigious award”.
