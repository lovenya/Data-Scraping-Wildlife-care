Every year, World Wetlands Day is celebrated on 2 February to commemorate the signing of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which was first signed on 2 February 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar. Since 1997, World Wetlands Day has served as a good platform for raising public awareness on wetlands and their significance, as well as the need to conserve them. 



World Wetlands Day was celebrated by WWF-India in the Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand which have been actively engaged in wetland conservation for a number of years. This year, events were organized around the theme of ‘Wetlands and Agriculture: Partners for Growth’, which emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between wetlands and agriculture and the need to work together with a unified vision for both for long-term sustainability. 



Jammu and Kashmir

In Jammu and Kashmir, WWF-India in collaboration with Department of Wildlife Protection, organized a full-day event at Shey wetland in Leh, which included a field trip of the frontline Wildlife staff to the Shey marshes as well as an in-field orientation programme jointly organized by WWF-India and the Wildlife Division, Leh. The programme was designed to develop an insight among the field staff and make them understand the importance of wetlands and the significance of their conservation. The event assumes significance as it was held at a frozen wetland site. This is a typical feature of Himalayan high altitude wetlands which remain frozen during winters. During the summer season, these wetlands begin to melt and become a hub of biological activity for a large number of migratory species of birds. Mr Intesar Suhail, Wildlife warden, Leh delivered a talk on the importance of wetlands and their significance as waterfowl habitats, highlighting the efforts of the Department of Wildlife Protection towards conservation of wetlands in Jammu and Kashmir. Pushpinder Singh Jamwal, WWF-India spoke to the gathering about the benefits of wetlands which go beyond their significance to human society and extend to being important refuges for wildlife as well. The programme was attended by a diverse audience including members of Shey civil society and heads of local panchayats. 



Uttarakhand

In collaboration with the Chakrata Forest Division of the Uttarakhand Forest Department, WWF-India’s Dehradun Programme Office organized a bird-watching session and an on-the-spot painting competition at Asan Conservation Reserve, Dehradun for over 150 students from various schools from Dehradun and surrounding areas. The bird-watching session was led by Mr Sanjay Sondhi, naturalist and founder-trustee at the Titli Trust. Mr Sondhi helped students identify the different species of waterfowl present at the wetland and spoke about their dependence on wetlands for survival. The bird-watching session was followed by a painting competition on the theme of ‘Wetlands and Agriculture’. Mrs Nalini Chaudhury, naturalist, encouraged children to express their thoughts on nature and sustainability on canvas while keeping the theme in mind.



From WWF-India, Dr Anil Singh, Team Leader, Terai Arc Landscape, Dehradun, and Dr Jatinder Kaur, Coordinator, spoke about the significance of the theme and the critical need to save wetlands for agriculture. Dr Diwakar Sinha, DFO Chakrata and Dr Kishor Nautiyal, Executive Director (SAMVEDI) also graced the occasion.

WWF-India’s Shimla field office in collaboration with the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department held a day-long event commemorating World Wetlands Day at the GSF Government Senior Secondary School, Dehra. Mr J. C. Katoch, DFO, Dehra was the chief guest at the event.
