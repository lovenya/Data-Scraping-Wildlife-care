The Sapera community living around the outskirts of Dehradun, the capital city of Uttarakhand came together for a sensitisation programme on wildlife protection and conservation, organized by TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network, and WWF-India, a wildlife conservation organization. The programme reached out to the residents of the Bhaniyawala basti on 16 April 2016 and the Mathurawala basti on 17 April 2016, both basti’s having the highest number of households of the Sapera community.



Generating awareness and understanding among the community about the impact of poaching and illegal wildlife trade on wildlife conservation and protection, and garnering community support were the main objectives behind organizing this programme. The community was also made aware of the laws and regulations regarding poaching and illegal wildlife trade and the legal implications of engaging in wildlife crime of any order. Sapera, is a community of snake charmers in North India living on the outskirts of towns and cities. The traditional as well as prime occupation of this community has been snake charming and since the Saperas have been expert snake catchers, they are often called in by the villagers to catch snakes from their fields and homes.



Over the years, the Sapera community began engaging in poaching and smuggling of various lesser known and smaller sized endangered wildlife species such as monitor lizards, pangolins, civet cats among many others. The poaching has been both for personal meat consumption and for organized illegal wildlife trade making it imperative to engage support of this community in the region.  



The sensitisation programme included a puppet show and an educational talk and was attended by more than 250 people including women and children of the Sapera community. The puppet show communicating the importance of wildlife, the need to curb poaching and other issues related to illegal wildlife activities was extremely popular among the audience. The community members also shared their problems during the interactive sessions of the programme. Various posters, calendars, and pamphlets in Hindi on this issue were distributed and were well received by the community members.



Mr Sanjay Nath, the Pradhan (Head of the community) of the Mathurawala basti , assured his  support to ensure that the community members stop engaging in illegal wildlife activities such as poaching and smuggling of protected wildlife species. He also spoke about the community’s overall interest in preserving wildlife for long term sustenance of natural resources, crucial to the sustenance of the community’s well being.



In 2015, the Pradhan had also declared a fine of INR 25 000 on any member of the community found guilty of poaching protected wildlife species, clearly setting an example for other Panchayats of the Sapera community in North India. He strongly stressed on the need to provide alternative livelihood opportunities to the community members to wean them off their dependence on forest and wildlife.



Dr Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC India says, “Sapera is one of the several communities of India that have been traditionally involved in hunting wild animals for their subsistence. However, over the years the communities have ventured into large scale poaching and smuggling of endangered wildlife for organized and commercially driven illegal wildlife trade. In order to protect Indian wildlife, it is important to disengage such communities from hunting and trading wildlife”.



“Besides sensitising the community, providing alternative livelihood is an important part of the overall strategy. This is the first time that TRAFFIC has conducted an awareness campaign with a local community in India and is hopeful that such initiatives along with robust alternative livelihood support and opportunities will help to change the mindsets of the community members in the long run” he further added.



The programme is a part of an awareness campaign initiated by TRAFFIC India and WWF-India to sensitise and engage support of local communities for protection and conservation of wildlife across India. TRAFFIC plans to conduct many such awareness programmes with several hunting communities across India in the coming year. Mr Amarnath Choudhary of TRAFFIC India conducted the programme in the field along with the TRAFFIC field coordinators. ‘Saperas’ of North India learn about wildlife protection and conservation
