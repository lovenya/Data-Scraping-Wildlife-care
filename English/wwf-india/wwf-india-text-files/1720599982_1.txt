The story of the mischievous antics of a young elephant from Dudhwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh
Working in the field for wildlife conservation can get really exciting at times! The story behind theGarmin eTrex 10 GPS handset, a pair of Nikon Action 8x40 binoculars and Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ18 digital camera is quite interesting indeed. They were allotted for the purpose of a standardized monitoring protocol for rhinos in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, in Uttar Pradesh. Five elephant handlers (mahavats) were provided with one of each of these to collect and compile remote-sensed data with photographic data to track individual rhinos, which are identified using IDs, much like those for humans, except the ones for rhinos rely purely on facial and physical characteristics. 



This set of equipment was in the custody of Sushil Kumar, Mahavat, who was dutifully using them for the past two years, with a whopping elephant patrol covering over 1,500 kilometres in 2013 alone! One evening, after returning from the daily patrol, he got off his elephant and began removing all the load from the back of his elephant Pakhri when all of a sudden an elephant named Batalik parked himself next to him. 



“Batalik is a fourteen year old elephant, who was born on the day the Kargil war was won in the year 1999, and hence was given his name. Curiously, Batalik inherited all the fighter qualities that his name would suggest, often not listening to his mahavat and being a typically rebellious male elephant. Only problem was that at fourteen years of age, he is already nine feet at shoulder height, making him a difficult and mischievous baby elephant to deal with. So when he parked himself next to Pakhri, he promptly grabbed Sushil's kit bag, which contained all his patrolling equipment comprising the GPS handset, a pair of binoculars and the digital camera, and stamped on it,” narrated Ruchir Sharma, Field Officer-Rhino Monitoring, WWF-India recalling the incident.



By the time anyone could react, Batalik had already had his fill of amusement, leaving the equipment in its current state, which you can see in the photo on the side. 



“Batalik is a very naughty elephant! He is 14 years old now so he is still prone to doing mischief. But he is very good at tracking tigers and instantly informs me if a tiger is nearby when we are patrolling. Once he grows up, he will become the top elephant of the Park,” added Sushil Kumar, Mahavat, Dudhwa National Park.



WWF-India will soon replace the damaged equipment with new equipment so that the rhino and other wildlife monitoring work can proceed uniterrupted. Greater care would also be taken with such equipment when Batalik is in the vicinity to avoid such michief in the future!
