The objective behind this workshop was to train teachers for effectively imparting EE through the subjects they teach, by infusing environmental themes. It also aimed to establish that all teachers can be EE teachers.



The workshop was a great success and was well-received by teachers. They were forthcoming in all the activity sessions that were planned for them. The team launched an interactive poster for teachers to use in their classrooms.



The EE team, through this workshop has set foot on a journey to integrate EE into curriculums by trying to equip teachers with new methodologies of teaching and furthering its’ vision to inform, inspire and empower India’s children and youth to take action for a healthy planet. 



‘’Thank you so much for such an eye opening session on environmental education in Springdales School. It was an amazing experience to be the part of it. I am definitely going to share those activities with my kids and colleagues.Those activities were really motivating’’.
