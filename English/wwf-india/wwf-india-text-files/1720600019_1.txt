Technology, particularly communications technology, has become an essential component of the information-gathering field, especially in the past decade. As has been the case in the consumer market, in the field of wildlife monitoring and analysis, wireless connectivity has become the cornerstone of innovation in tracking and management of data gathered from wildlife areas, ranging from population size estimates, habitat use and preference to regional biodiversity.



Recent advancements in wireless technology have enabled these systems to be obtained at a low cost, enabling the coverage networks to expand deeper into the heart of numerous Protected Areas that were otherwise difficult to reach. 



In the case of endangered animals, tracking their movements has enabled forest staff and agencies to improve their ability to protect them from harmful circumstances and outside factors such as human-wildlife conflicts and poaching. The availability of this information will in the long-term help to establish a strategy that could someday enable these animals to repopulate, relocate and eventually thrive once again. 



India has become an emerging example of how moderntechnologies have been integrated into theenforcement protocols to control wildlife monitoring and poaching. Wireless equipmenthas become a critical requirement for India’s frontline forest staff as they have empowered their teams to respond quickly to challenges during anti-poaching operations and other duties. With these objectives in mind, wireless communication systems have been installed at every patrol camp within some tiger reserves, typically in remote areas where limited telephonic connectivity is available. 



The Valmiki Tiger Reserve(VTR) is the only tiger reserve in the state of Bihar and occupies a total area of ~1000km2. VTR is located in the northeastern corner of the state, along the international border with Nepal in West Champaran district. The reserve is contiguous with Nepal's Chitwan National Park on the north, sharing a boundary of ~100km forested habitat and is also tenuously connected with Sohagibarwa Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh, India. 





At VTR, wireless communication systems wereinitially setup inDecember 1992invarious sections of the reserve. The purpose being: to enable better and timely sharing of information from the field and coordinate responses. Recently, this equipment has been augmented, and VTR has installed more than 20 wireless stations spread across the entire region, with its control room located at Bettiah –its headquarters. 



In general, the efficiency and effectiveness of a wireless communication system is dependent on the performance of their frontline staff, who are appointed to communicaterelevant information to forest officers. However, a majority of the staffusing these wireless systemshas been recruited from local villages and do not have the requisite knowledge of wireless communication protocols. Rudimentary training that has been conducted for these purposes has so far been inadequate, and not properly assessed for their effectiveness. Moreover, thetraining sessionson wireless communication werelast held in the year 1992.Since then, the tiger population has increased by some margin and several activities related to wildlife monitoring, tourism and habitat management have developed to a point requiring 24-hour shifts from all personnel involved in monitoring duties.Critical information relating to wildlife sighting, anti-poaching and habitat management thus need to be constantly delivered to their respective officers. 



“No training has been organized since 1992 and we are using thesame communication protocols which were created during the establishment period”, said one of the staff’ members, presently working on the communication systems. 



To fulfill this requirement, WWF-India in association with the VTR organized a training workshop on the use of wireless Systems at the Gobardhana Range office on 27 August 2014. The objective of this training workshop was to bringthe staff up-to-date on the latest information and best practices from various fields such as wireless maintenance, security concerns regarding the use of communication codes and frequenciesas well asoverall communication protocols. Approximately, 45 participants attended the workshop.



The workshop was inaugurated at 09:30AMwith a talk by Mr Ajay Kumar Sinha, Range Officer of Gobardhana, VTR, who welcomed all participants and explained the need for organizing the workshop while outlining theactivities thatWWF- India had been conducting in the region. Mr AnkushSanyal, Sub Inspector, SSB, Nartkatiahanj, was the primary resource person at the workshop, who began the first session with a discussion on the basic functions and definitions of wireless communication such as rhythm, pitch and correction. Thereafter, Mr Ankush, described various important security measures to be followed while communicating over wireless.He shared his experience of wireless communication in the SSB battalion and trained forest staff how to code and decode this information. Post-lunch, the participants were taken to roomswhere wirelessequipment was explained from a technical perspective, outlining the various systems, components and instructions pertaining to minor repairing and handling were discussed. Participants were divided into six different groups who were asked to dismantle the wireless system and re-assemble it. The workshop was a great success and concludedwith a short discussion and summarization of the need for wireless systems in VTR by Dr Kamlesh K. Maurya, Senior Project Officer, TAL, WWF-India. 



“Valmiki Tiger Reserve is situated on the international border where there is limited telephone connectivity. The wireless communication system thus forms the lifeline for the frontline staff during patrolling & anti-poaching operations. This made it imperative to ensure that operators and frontline staff of the VTR were properly oriented on security measures, communication codes and maintenance of these systems”, said Dr Mudit Gupta, Landscape Coordinator, WWF-India.
