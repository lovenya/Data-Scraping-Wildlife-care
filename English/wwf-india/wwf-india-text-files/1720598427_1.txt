New Delhi – TRAFFIC India has advised tourists to be careful of what they buy as souvenirs during their travels. The message comes in the form of four eye-catching posters depicting models handcuffed next to confiscated wildlife goods, under the heading “Don’t Buy Trouble”.



The four designs, produced with support from WWF-India are:

Shawls of Shame: Crime – Wearing a Shahtoosh shawl without an ownership certificate. These shawls are tainted with the blood of Chiru (Tibetan Antelope), a protected species that is threatened with extinction. Between two to three Chirus are killed to make one shawl. 
Blood Ivory: Crime – Buying ivory products. Elephants in the wild are illegally slaughtered for their ivory, which is then converted into statues, jewellery and other artefacts. It is illegal in India to possess or trade in ivory from Asian or African Elephants. 
Skinned Fashion: Crime – Carrying a reptile skin handbag made from a protected species. Protected species of crocodiles, snakes and lizards are skinned to make handbags, shoes, watch straps and other fashion accessories. 
Marine Plunder: Crime – Possessing protected marine products such as Giant Clams, seashells, corals etc. 



Targeted mainly at domestic and foreign tourists, the posters send a clear message across that it is not only the poachers and traders who are liable for punishment under India’s Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 for hunting or trading in products made from protected species of wildlife, , but also those who purchase and use such products. The end consumer thus becomes as much as the partner in wildlife crime as the trader or the poacher. If found guilty, the offender is liable to hefty fines and up to 7 years of imprisonment. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.



Samir Sinha, Head of TRAFFIC India, commented: “Illegal wildlife trade has caused large-scale damage to our wildlife to the point where the very survival of certain species is threatened. Through these posters, TRAFFIC India hopes to drive home the point that souvenirs derived from endangered species of wildlife should not be treated as mementos, but rather as symbols of the wanton destruction of our natural heritage. If in doubt, don’t buy.”



He further added: “Wildlife in India is an integral part of our rich culture and heritage. Therefore, the onus to protect and nurture it lies with each one of us. We can simply start by saying ‘NO’ to such products that may be offered to us for sale.”



Tourists travel widely, and may inadvertently contribute to the illegal trade in threatened Indian wildlife. TRAFFIC India hopes to gain support and co-operation from the tourism industry in disseminating this message through the “Don’t Buy Trouble” series of posters. The posters were shot by top photographer Akash Das and designed by Crossbow Designs Pvt. Ltd.



In October 2007, TRAFFIC India launched a Consumer Awareness Campaign with the release of the leaflet, “Are you committing a Crime? Think before you buy”, which is available at www.wwfindia.org/traffic

Notes 

Illegal wildlife trade is widespread globally, and is probably second in value behind the illegal narcotics and arms trades. The most commonly known products in illegal wildlife trade in India are: Mongoose hair, snakeskin, Rhino horn, Tiger and Leopard claws, bones, skins, whiskers, Elephant tusks, deer antlers, turtle shells, musk pods, bear bile, medicinal plants, timber and caged birds such as parakeets, mynas and munias. ‘Don’t Buy Trouble’ – Traffic India Warns
