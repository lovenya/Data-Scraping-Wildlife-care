On Global Tiger Day 2018 (GTD ‘18), taking the annual theme of #Connect2Tiger, WWF-India conducted a wide gamut of activities across its 6 tiger-bearing landscapes, treating 29th July as an opportunity to bridge a prominent gap between the knowledge and the understanding of diverse issues ailing our planet and all forms of life inhabiting it. A void created cause of the changes occuring in our environment and biodiversity!







Ranging from rallies, drawing competitions, plantation drives to street plays and documentary screenings, field teams across India were busy driving home the aim of conserving tigers and with it save our natural heritage, within the local communities living in fringe villages, as well as school students residing within urban limits.







In Delhi, WWF-India in partnership with National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), National Ministry of Natural History (NMNH), Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and various other organisations came together with school and college students across Delhi NCR to build an essence of conservation of tigers in India among them. Across the span of four days, engagement activities like story writing, drawing, poem writing, street plays and quiz competition were conducted to sensitise the youth in a fun-filled manner. Moreover, a key address by Hon’ble Minister of MoEF&CC about the future of tigers in India, secured the faith of seeing increased tigers in the wild



Meanwhile, in the Sundarbans Landscape, where the big cats roam in the vast mangroves, the field team saw GTD ‘18 as an opportunity to interact and engage with the school students of Kolkata and educate them on career choices in the field of environment conservation.



Eminent personalities from the field of wildlife conservation, journalism, media, wildlife law enforcement, etc. came forward as representatives of their field of work, providing insight to the students on the need of conservation and its importance to present times. This was followed by students taking over in the second half of the event, where they made presentations on topics themed on wildlife trafficking, citizen science and conservation, unsustainable practices of mankind,etc.







On the other hand, across the Terai Arc Landscape, where the tigers take to hills and grasslands to mark their territories, our fields team from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar involved themselves with the local communities of fringe villages educating them on the work being done by WWF-India in mitigating human tiger conflicts and outlining the Do’s and Don’ts of reducing such cases.







A rally at Valmiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar was organised with the Sashastra Seema Bal, Eco Development Committees and state forest department and was attended by 419 students from various schools, along with various SSB officials and Forest Department officials. With an aim of promoting protection and expansion of wild tigers’ habitat and gain support through awareness of tiger conservation.







Whereas, in Uttarakhand the team thought of involving the frontline staff themself in the celebrations, by involving them in fun-filled activities like, drawing competition and showcasing  short films and documentaries to further their interest in the species they work to protect and conserve.



In Western India Tiger Landscape, the field team members took out time to engage in a dialogue with the school students of corridor villages to educate them on the kind of conservation work being done in the landscape, while outlining major threats to tigers and humans arising out of conflict and habitat fragmentation. The event concluded with a plantation drive.







In Western Ghats Nilgiri Landscape, Global Tiger Day has been a day of tradition and celebration, where WWF-India aligns with the local communities, schools, college and state forest department to conduct cycle rally, a workshop on tiger conservation for scouts and guides and arrange for annual volleyball competition that is held with great enthusiasm and zest.







In the Satpuda Maikal Landscape, the school students living in fringe villages around the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve were engaged in fun filled activities like the drawing competition and formed a thunderous crowd at an awareness rally conducted in partnership with the Chhattisgarh Forest Department.



Meanwhile, another rally on similar lines of spreading awareness was conducted in Kanha Tiger Reserve with school students, teachers and members of the frontline staff walking shoulder to shoulder voicing slogans of conservation and protection of this magnanimous species that calls the wildlands of India, home!



Lastly, in the Brahmaputra Landscape, WWF-India in collaboration with State Forest Department held an awareness building workshop for 250 school students, where the keynote speakers were officials from the Forest Department took turns in making the young audience understand the importance of tigers as a flagship species and how its conservation is vital for the biodiversity surrounding them. A documentary screening of 50 minutes, towards the end of the event, thus encapsulated the entire message of protecting the apex predators.







Additionally, in Kaziranga National Park, WWF-India jointly with the Sub Divisional Administration Bokakhat, conducted a first of its kind of community interaction meeting on Community Involvement in Tiger Conservation, with an aim of making the local communities aware of the vitality of tiger conservation in their area and gaining their cumulative trust and participation in becoming stakeholders at carrying out tiger conservation activities.
