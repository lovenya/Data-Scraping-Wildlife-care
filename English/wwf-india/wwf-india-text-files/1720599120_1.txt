World Migratory Bird Day (WMBD) 2011 was observed by WWF-India in the high altitude areas of Ladakh and Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir. In Ladakh, WWF-India in collaboration with Department of Wildlife Protection, Government of Jammu and Kashmir and IBCN organized a painting competition on the themes “Land Use Change from a Birds Eye View” and “Migratory Birds and Their Habitats” at Lamdon Model Senior Secondary School Leh on May 14, 2011. 



On May 15, 2011, a number of students and teachers from about 16 institutions were taken on a bird watching trip to Gupuks where students got a chance to observe the activities of the birds in their habitat. The students were briefed about the phenomenon of bird migration and their migratory routes. They were, also taken to the habitat of ‘Ibisbill’ at Choglamsar near the River Indus followed by nature trail up to Shey marshes where they sighted different migratory birds. 



In Rajouri, a two days education and awareness campaign on the importance of Migratory Birds and the need for their conservation was organized by WWF-India in collaboration with Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (BGSBU), Rajouri. On May 14, around seventy students from different schools participated in painting competition and a slogan writing competition on this year’s theme for World Migratory Bird Day i.e. “Land use changes from a bird’s-eye view”. 



On May 15, a group of 110 students was taken on a nature trail to Muradpur along the Rajouri River which originates in the Pir Panjal range of Middle Himalaya. During the nature trail, students were taken on a bird sighting trip where they were brought face to face with vivid avian fauna and they themselves were able to understand the relationship between the birds and the ecological balance they help in maintaining. Students learnt about various scientific techniques to study birds. They were also made aware about the “International Flyways Conservation Project” which aims at conservation of the migratory flyways of the birds. Sensitivity was generated to the fact that various migratory birds do not recognize the boundaries created by humans and therefore they are the ambassadors of international peace and goodwill. It is this great message of peace through migratory birds needs to reach to common masses in different parts of the world. 



In addition to this, the students were also educated about various water quality parameters through the water quality testing exercise. They were made aware about the importance of these parameters and their influence on the quality of a stream ecosystem. They also learned about the various life forms that are harbored by the streams/rivers in general and Rajouri River in particular. In this way, the students developed an understanding about the wetlands and marshes along with the important rivers which act as important habitat for Migratory Birds. World Migratory Bird Day 2011
