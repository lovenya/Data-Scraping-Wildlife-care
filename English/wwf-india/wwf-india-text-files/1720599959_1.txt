A breeding pair of ruddy shelduck sighted at a high altitude wetland in Arunachal Pradesh by a WWF-India team
On 4 June 2014, a WWF-India team stationed at the Nagula wetland complex in Western Arunachal Landscape, reported the sighting of a ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) breeding pair, along with their duckling. The ruddy shelduck, also known as the Brahminy duck, is known to breed inneighbouringAsian countries. Until recently, there had been scattered reports of this species breeding in the high altitude lakes of Arunachal Pradesh, which this sighting confirms. The pair was spotted with their tiny duckling in a high altitude lake located at a height of 4300m above sea level in the Nagula wetland complex.



“This sighting of a breeding pair confirms the importance of high altitude lakes in Arunachal Pradesh. A conservation strategy with multiple stakeholders including the local community and military personnel would help the long-term survival of this species and its breeding habitat in the Eastern Himalayas,” noted Mr Kamal Medhi,Landscape Coordinator, Western Arunachal Landscape, WWF-India



Two other high altitude breeding sites in India are in Jammu & Kashmirand Sikkim, although to date there has been scant evidence to confirm their actual use as breeding sites by this species. This sighting represents the second confirmed photographic evidence that high altitude lakes in Arunachal Pradesh, are in fact, used as breeding sites. In June 2011, a survey of the high altitude wetlands in Arunachal Pradesh by WWF-India recorded a similar sighting of a breeding pair, including seven ducklings of the species. These sightings were recorded at lakes at 4500m above sea level in the Thembang Bapu Community Conserved Area of the West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.



Wetland areas surrounding high altitude lakes support a tremendous range of biodiversity, particularly bird life. Most of these sites are located along the Indian-Chinese (Tibet) border in the five Himalayan states. Arunachal Pradesh contains more than 350 such wetland areas.



To help build support for increased conservation efforts and assistance from stakeholders in this region, WWF-India has aimed to document the presence ofthis rich and rare biodiversity. Currently,suchefforts are underway in four such wetlands complexes including Nagula in western Arunachal Pradesh. 



The Nagula wetland complex faces numerous anthropogenic pressures including grazing of cattle from nearby settlements. Due to the area’sproximity to the international border, the area has a high military presence, which has necessitated the construction of roads for connectivity between military installations and camps. While the presence of the military is an essential requirement from the perspective of national security, it is critical to ensure an eco-friendlyconstruction approach around these lake regions and inculcate an overallwildlife friendly attitude among the military cadres to minimize the damage dealt to such vital breeding grounds.



As there are plans for continued infrastructure improvements in the area, it is crucial that immediate action is taken to preserve these diverse habitats before irreversible damage deprives the world of their magnificent beauty.
