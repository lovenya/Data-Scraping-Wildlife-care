Ranthambore’s straying tigers and the dangers they face during dispersal
Ranthambore Tiger Reserve is one of the most well known tiger reserves in India. Currently home to more than 50 tigers the Tiger Reserve has well exceeded its normal carrying capacity of 30-35 tigers. While more tiger numbers are a reason to cheer, however, since tigers are territorial and need to establish their own territory younger tigers are moving out of Ranthambore to find new territories. This dispersal, while normally good for establishment of new tiger populations, is posing many challenges to the survival of these dispersing Ranthambore tigers due to lack of connectivity and intense human pressures in the surrounding corridors and buffer forests and due to a lack of a coordinated strategy to deal with such straying tigers.



In August 2013, a male cub of T-8 tigress from Ranthambore migrated out of the Tiger Reserve in a south-westerly direction and reached the forests in Bundi district of Rajasthan. Teams from the Rajasthan Forest Department and WWF-India’s Western India Tiger Landscape (WITL) immediately reached the area to track the tiger and ensure that it remained unharmed. Soon, the team learnt that the tiger was preying on livestock, thereby increasing the risk of retaliatory killing from local villagers. In addition, given the prevalence of hunting in the area and anthropogenic pressures in the surrounding areas the best option for the tiger to survive in the long term might be for it to be translocated to a Protected Area. 



Previously, WWF-India’s WITL team had photographed on camera traps another sub-adult tigress from Ranthambore outside the northern boundary of the Ranthambore National Park (RNP) area. This camera trapping is part of WWF-India’s work on corridor conservation and monitoring in WITL. By deploying opportunistic camera traps adjacent to the scrublands and forest patches near villages outside RNP, which can be termed as corridors for the wildlife species, the field biologists of WWF-India are trying to understand the occupancy and utilization patterns of these non- protected forest areas by tigers and other wildlife species.



While both tigers are currently active in the areas above a coordinated strategy is needed to deal with such dispersing tigers. In the meanwhile, teams from both the Rajasthan Forest Department and WWF-India are working closely to ensure that the tigers are not harmed in any way. 



"Effective monitoring and tracking of tigers with identification and development of corridors is the strategy of the Rajasthan Forest Department and on which we are working consistently", said Mr. Rahul Bhatnagar, DCF Core (I) & Field Director, Ranthambore Tiger Reserve.



“We need to ensure that the dispersing tigers of Ranthambore can safely migrate to nearby Protected Areas and establish new territories. But this needs sustained effort to ensure that connections through the corridor forests between Ranthambore Tiger Reserve and surrounding Protected Areas are maintained”, added Mr. Sunny Shah, Coordinator, Western India Tiger Landscape, WWF-India.
