Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala: The state of Kerala can meet over 95 per cent of its energy demand with renewable sources by 2050, according to a report released today by WWF-India and World Institute of Sustainable Energy, Pune at Maurya Hotel, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. This state specific report (The Energy Report-Kerala) provides a vision for a 100 per cent renewable and sustainable energy supply by 2050.



This report is a sequel to the global study “The Energy Report – 100% renewable energy by 2050” published by WWF International in 2011 and the “The Energy Report-India – 100% renewable energy by 2050” published by WWF-India and TERI earlier this month. The report is an attempt to model the energy requirements (across power, transport, agriculture, industry, domestic and commercial sectors) of Kerala up to 2050, in order to assess the feasibility of meeting 100 per cent of the state’s energy demand through renewable sources. 



Kerala has very few fossil fuel resources and much of its large hydro potential is already harnessed. The emissions from coal based or gas based power projects in coastal Kerala may adversely affect both the forests as well as the fragile marine ecosystems of Kerala, as well as the health of the population. Given such myriad constraints, Kerala faces a future threat to its energy security. It is acknowledged that most renewable energy technologies have low environmental impacts; hence a planned transition to 100 per cent renewable energy for Kerala would be desirable for the future sustainable development and energy security of Kerala. 



The report analyses different scenarios for the time period up till 2050 and assesses the potential of different renewable energy sources to meet the energy demand. Major approaches followed for the study involved assessing renewable energy (RE) supply potential over the projection time frame and modelling of business-as-usual (BAU) and curtailed demand scenarios. It also entailed matching the supply options with curtailed demand across energy carriers for electricity, heat and transport fuels. Various strategic interventions, specifically policy considerations and state investment considerations, are also studied in the report. An interesting observation in the report is that due to various measures such as energy efficiency, energy conservation and carrier substitution, the curtailed demand scenario has the potential to reduce energy demand by about 60 per cent as compared to the demand in the BAU scenario.



On the release of the Energy Report – Kerala, Mr G.M. Pillai, Director General, WISE remarked, “Being a native of Kerala and having spent my childhood here, for me this report holds all the more significance as it could facilitate timely policy intervention and enable the much needed transition to a sustainable energy economy. It is my firm belief that the report will go a long way in leading the state towards attaining energy independence and environmental sustainability in the near future.” 



Dr Sejal Worah, Programme Director, WWF-India said, “This report has high relevance for Kerala given the limited fossil fuel resources in the state, presence of sensitive ecosystems and the increasing demand for energy. Considering the long term energy security scenario, this report provides a basis for deliberations towards charting a renewable energy future for Kerala as well as for India.” The Energy Report- Kerala: 100% Renewable Energy by 2050
