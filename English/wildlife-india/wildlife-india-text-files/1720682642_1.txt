A tigress abandoned her two cubs in a farm field  of a small village of Katni district .After waiting for their mothers for about a week,  the forest departent  transferred the cubs-about two and half months old- to  White tiger Safari, Mukundpur in Rewa. The big cat seems to have dispersed from  Bandhavgarh national park , about 65 kms away from Jhiriya village of Katni where the cubs were located. Katni is strategically located between Bandhavgarh and Panna tiger reserves. Wildlife experts fear for the life of both -the tigress and her cubs.Tigress , Cubs Unsafe  
The tigress was spotted by some villagers on December 12 night in Jhiriya village. She was accompanying her three cubs. But in the morning, the two cubs were found in a farm but the tigress was missing with the third cub. When villagers first spotted the cubs, they were shivering in cold in the absence of the warmth of their mother.  A senior forest department official said that after the tigress dispersed from some nearby forest , maybe Bandhavgarh tiger reserve, along with three cubs, she realized  that her two cubs were too weak to accompany  her. As the two cubs failed to  maintain the pace with their mother, she  left them. The cubs reached Mukundpur zoo on December 20 and were being looked after. Experts said  they are struggling  in the absence of their mother. On the other hand the life of the tigress and the third cub is also at risk as they are exposed to the villages. Katni and its neighborhood is known for poaching of tigers and smuggling of tiger parts and hides.
