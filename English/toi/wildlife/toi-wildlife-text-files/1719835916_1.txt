MYSURU: A day after numerous complaints about the presence of a big cat within the human habitat of Mysuru taluk, the confirmation of a tiger's presence has been established through images and footage captured by a camera trap and CCTV.

What has astounded the forest officials is the tiger's location, situated 10km away from the Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR). The nearest tiger forest area, Chikkanahalli in Bandipur, raises questions about how the tiger managed to thrive in this new territory. An ongoing operation is underway to identify the tiger, which appears to have survived by preying on cattle in the area.
Malathi Priya, conservator of forests in Mysuru Circle, revealed that the tiger's image was captured in a camera trap between Chikkakanya and Doddakanya villages. Additionally, CCTV footage from the TVS factory has further confirmed the tiger's presence. The tiger has been responsible for killing cattle in the region, prompting the adoption of the Bandipur method of operation. This involves using camouflaged cages with two staff members inside to administer tranquilizers to the tiger.
