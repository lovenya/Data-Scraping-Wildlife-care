NEW DELHI: A mere 25 days after cheetah Aasha welcomed three new members into the Kuno family, the wildlife sanctuary in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh is rejoicing once again as another Cheetah Jwala, introduces three adorable cubs into the world.
This momentous occasion aligns with the auspicious arrival of Lord Ram in Ayodhya, marking the arrival of these "Three little sparks of speed" into the ever-growing family of Kuno National Park, ushering in a new chapter of vitality and excitement within the sanctuary, as confirmed by an official statement.
This development is a significant milestone for India's conservation efforts, building on the recent birth of 'Aasha's' robust litter of cubs inside Kuno. Fathered by wanderer cheetah Pawan ‘Oban,’

Minister of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF), Bhupendra Yadav, tweeted his congratulations to wildlife enthusiasts nationwide, expressing optimism for the thriving wildlife in Bharat.
Director General Forest C P Goyal also shared his happiness, acknowledging the efforts of those involved in this unique conservation project. The six cubs stand as a beacon of hope for the restoration of the cheetah population in India, with authorities closely monitoring their growth and development in a secure environment.
However, the journey to this success was not without challenges. In May 2023, Project Cheetah faced a setback when three of four cubs born to Jwala succumbed to scorching temperatures, reaching up to 46-47 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest day of the summer season. Despite their best efforts, three cubs could not be saved, and only one survived.
The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) responded to the incident by forming a "Cheetah Project Steering Committee" to review the project's progress, explore eco-tourism opportunities, and gather suggestions on community involvement.
In September 2022, the nation witnessed the arrival of three female cheetahs from Namibia, including the spirited Jwala. In March 2023, Jwala's vigilant behavior led to the discovery of a den containing four historic cheetah cubs, the first born on Indian soil in 75 years. 
Unfortunately, the harsh summer conditions claimed three lives, leaving a single cub as a testament to the unwavering commitment to conserving India's cheetah population.
