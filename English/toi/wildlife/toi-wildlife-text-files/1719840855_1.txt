NEW DELHI: The extreme heat that India is witnessing has taken a toll on both humans and wildlife, with the health ministry reporting more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18.
The country has been grappling with extreme weather conditions this summer, with a prolonged heatwave affecting large parts of the country and heavy rainfall causing floods in the northeast.The heatwave, which has been attributed to human-driven climate change, has resulted in temperatures soaring to nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in north India, making it one of the longest heatwave spells on record.
Birds have been falling from the skies due to the intense heat, and hospitals have seen an influx of heat-affected patients. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, "During the ongoing heatwave, most bird rescue calls that we receive are due to birds falling from the skies."
In response to the heatwave, the health ministry has ordered federal and state institutions to provide immediate attention to patients, while hospitals in Delhi, which is also facing a water shortage, have been directed to make more beds available. The weather office has forecast above-normal temperatures for this month as well, with authorities attributing the heat traps in Indian cities to unbalanced growth.
