Despite the humour infused into these animal images, there's a more serious aspect to the awards. Established in 2015 by professional photographers Paul Joynson-Hicks and Tom Sullam, the competition also serves as a platform for wildlife conservation. This year, the event is lending its support to the Whitley Fund for Nature, a UK charity dedicated to funding conservation efforts worldwide.
The panel of expert judges includes notable UK figures like TV presenter Kate Humble, comedian Hugh Dennis, and renowned wildlife photographers Daisy Gilardini and Will Bullard-Lucas.
