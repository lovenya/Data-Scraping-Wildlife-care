A quiet village in Gurugram was the scene of a chilling wildlife encounter when two leopards were caught on CCTV footage as they made their way into a cowshed and killed ten cattle. This incident occurred in Tikli village, a place that sits close to the Aravalli range, providing a natural habitat for wildlife but also leading to occasional human-animal conflicts.
The event took place on a Tuesday, and the footage quickly spread, causing alarm among the villagers. The leopards, known for their stealth and agility, silently entered the cowshed and attacked the cattle. The forest department was quoted saying, “We have received information about the leopard attack in Tikli village. Around ten days ago, we also received information about a leopard attack in the same area, after which our staff came here for a visit.” The official further added, "In the CCTV footage, two leopards can be seen arriving in the area. Cows are easy prey for the leopards, and that is the reason they have become habitual to come in the area"

The officials decided to set up capturing cages in an attempt to safely trap the leopards and prevent further attacks. A forest official explained, "We have issued directions to the concerned administration to raise the walls of the cowshed or set a trap as a precaution. They have requested that we set up a capturing cage, for which we will set up two capturing cages to catch the leopard."
The forest department’s response was swift, considering the gravity of the situation and the potential danger to both humans and animals. They issued directives to the local administration to implement safety precautions and prepared to set up two capturing cages.
This incident has highlighted the delicate balance between human settlements and wildlife habitats. As urban areas expand, such encounters may become more frequent, necessitating proactive measures to ensure the safety of all involved. The forest department’s actions reflect a commitment to managing the situation with a focus on conservation and coexistence.

The incident in Tikli village serves as a call to action for better planning and infrastructure to safeguard against such occurrences in the future.
