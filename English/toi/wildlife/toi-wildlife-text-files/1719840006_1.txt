Panaji:Dudhsagar waterfall attracts tourists from far and wide. However, as the monsoon approaches, it becomes essential to minimise human interference to allow the unimpeded movement of wildlife and mitigate any potential risks associated with heavy rainfall and flooding.
The office of the deputy conservator of forests, wildlife and ecotourism (North), Panaji, has announced the closure of the Dudhsagar waterfall tourism circuit located in the Bhagwan Mahaveer National Park, Mollem, from June 1.
The decision to close the tourism circuit for vehicle movement is driven by the imperative to facilitate the proliferation of wildlife in the area and to ensure its undisturbed habitat during the monsoon.
This temporary closure is a proactive measure undertaken by the forest department to conserve the fragile ecosystem of the Bhagwan Mahaveer National Park and to implement responsible ecotourism. By restricting vehicular access to the tourism circuit, authorities aim to create a conducive environment for the natural regeneration and sustenance of the diverse wildlife inhabiting the region.
Authorities have urged the public to cooperate and respect the sanctity of the natural environment. The reopening of the Dudhsagar waterfall tourism circuit will be announced in due course, most likely after the monsoon.
