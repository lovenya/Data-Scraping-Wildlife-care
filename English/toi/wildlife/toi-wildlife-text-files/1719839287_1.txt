NEW DELHI: A man was caught trying to board a flight with snakes in his pants at the Miami International Airport in the United States. 
The Transportation Security Administration officials at the airport said the unidentified man had a small bag in his pants with small reptiles in it.
The bag was hidden in the passenger's clothing, officials said.

At the end of the week, TSA officers at JFK found a long machete from a man going through security. "He did not leave the checkpoint with it. Lesson learned: Don't bring a machete to an airport checkpoint," the TSA spokesperson said in a social media post. 
Earlier this year, a US man on a Southwest Airlines Flight was arrested in New Orleans after he allegedly jumped out of an emergency exit and climbed on a plane's wing in an attempt to run away as the aircraft was preparing to take off. 
The man was arrested after he ran out of the tarmac at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.
The witness at the airport said that the man was seen walking on the plane's wing before coming out of the airport. He also reportedly attempted to steal a service truck on the tarmac before being stopped by authorities, witnesses told the outlet.
Later, the police said the man was taken to the hospital for evaluation.
