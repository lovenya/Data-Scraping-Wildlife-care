IMPHAL: A rare Russian bird has been spotted after 108 years in Manipur.
A team comprising Wildlife Explorers Manipur (WEM) and Indian Bird Conservation Network saw the Baikal teal in Manipur's Lamphel wetland on Wednesday.
The bird has been spotted only twice earlier in the state - on March 16, 1913 and November 28, 1915. Its species was later identified by Bombay Natural History Society.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAlso called "su-rit-man", it breeds in eastern Russia and winters in east Asia.
It is classified as 'of least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. Before 2011, it was listed as a vulnerable species due to hunting and destruction of its wetland habitats.
"Threats remain, but the Baikal teal is recovering with an increase in its numbers and improved habitat area," said WEM secretary Elangbam Premjit.
