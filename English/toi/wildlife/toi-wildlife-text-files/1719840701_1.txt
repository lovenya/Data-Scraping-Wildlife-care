A team of scientists and researchers has made a significant discovery in the dense forests of Kasaragod, Kerala. They have identified a rare species of bioluminescent mushrooms, known scientifically as Filoboletus manipularis. These mushrooms are unique for their ability to emit a bright green glow during the night, a phenomenon that has captivated the attention of the scientific community.
The discovery was made during a micro-fungal survey conducted by the Kasaragod division of the Kerala Forest and Wildlife Department in collaboration with the Mushrooms of India Community. The survey took place in the Ranipuram forest, a region known for its rich biodiversity. The team, led by Dr. Jinu Muraleedharan, included prominent figures such as Kasaragod Divisional Forest Officer K Ashraf, Dr. Santhosh Kumar Kookal, KM Anoop, Sachin Pai, and Poorna Sajna.

The survey, which spanned both day and night, led to the identification of over 50 different species of mushrooms. However, the bioluminescent Filoboletus manipularis stood out among the findings. These mushrooms, also colloquially referred to as ‘electric mushrooms,’ have sparked interest due to their glowing property, which is not commonly found in terrestrial fungi.
Bioluminescence in mushrooms is a form of chemiluminescence, a chemical reaction that produces light. This process involves the pigment luciferin and the enzyme luciferase, with oxygen playing a crucial role. The light emitted by these mushrooms is thought to attract insects, which in turn help in the dispersal of spores, aiding in the reproductive cycle of the fungi.
Despite the allure of their luminous display, scientists have issued warnings against the consumption of these mushrooms. The chemicals responsible for their bioluminescence could potentially be toxic to humans, leading to severe gastrointestinal issues or other adverse health effects.
The discovery of Filoboletus manipularis is a testament to the rich fungal biodiversity present in the forests of Kasaragod. Dilip Kumar Rai, a botany expert and principal at Yangsum Senior Secondary School in Sikkim, remarked on the significance of this find. He emphasized that such discoveries shed light on the wonders of nature and the complex ecological interactions within forest ecosystems.
The Ranipuram forest, where these mushrooms were found, provides an ideal environment for their growth. The tropical, humid climate, coupled with an abundance of decaying organic matter, creates the perfect conditions for Filoboletus manipularis to thrive. The forest’s floor, littered with fallen leaves and branches, offers a nutrient-rich substrate for these fungi.
Dr. Muraleedharan has called for further research expeditions in the region to fully understand the potential and diversity of the mushroom species present. The findings from the survey highlight the incredible fertility of the area and suggest that there may be more discoveries waiting to be made.
