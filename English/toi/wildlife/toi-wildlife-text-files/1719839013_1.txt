This project is expected to enhance the conservation efforts for tigers and provide an opportunity for visitors to witness these majestic animals in a setting that closely resembles their natural habitat.
Chandrasekaran Bala N, the CEO of FDCM Gorewada Zoo Limited (FGZ), said, “The Rs212 crore African safari master plan is currently awaiting administrative approval from the state govt. Once approved, the project will move forward to the implementation phase.”
The introduction of the African safari is anticipated to provide a significant boost to tourism in the region. It will not only offer a new attraction for wildlife enthusiasts but also create job opportunities for the local community.
“The safari is expected to include a range of African wildlife, such as lions, giraffes, zebras, and rhinoceroses, allowing visitors to experience the diversity of African fauna,” FDCM official said.
The development of the African safari at Gorewada is a significant step towards diversifying the wildlife tourism offerings in India. It will complement the existing Indian safari and provide a holistic experience of both Indian and African wildlife.
“The boundary demarcation on the African safari has already been done. Bernard’s schematic designs for African safari (63ha), bird park (10ha), and safari plaza (4ha) have Central Zoo Authority (CZA) approval,” said Shatanik Bhagwat, zoo director.
“The African safari will house 30 animal species including zebra, giraffe, lions, cheetah, hippopotamus, spotted hyena, wildebeests, ostrich, baboons, and chimpanzees among other animals. If all goes well the African safari project will start work after Diwali,” said Bhagwat.
The African safari at Gorewada is a promising development for wildlife tourism in India. With the expertise of Harrison and his team, along with the support of FDCM and state govt, the project is poised to become a major attraction that will benefit both the wildlife and the people of the region.
