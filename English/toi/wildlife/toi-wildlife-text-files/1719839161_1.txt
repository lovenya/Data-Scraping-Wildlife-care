In the late 20th century, Switzerland faced a formidable public health challenge: rabies. This deadly virus, primarily transmitted through the bites of infected animals, poses a significant threat to both wildlife and humans. The Swiss authorities, determined to combat the disease, devised an innovative and unconventional strategy: air-dropping vaccine-laced chicken heads across the country’s forests and countryside.
The operation was set against the backdrop of a Europe grappling with rabies outbreaks, particularly in wild fox populations. Switzerland’s approach was groundbreaking. In the 1960s and 1970s, the country’s Federal Veterinary Office ordered that chicken heads stuffed with vaccine be placed on the ground in high-risk areas. This method was not only inventive but also effective, marking the beginning of a campaign that would eventually lead to the eradication of rabies in Switzerland.
The bait, designed to attract foxes, was laced with a vaccine that, once ingested, would immunize the animal against rabies. The strategy relied on the natural behavior of foxes to scavenge for food, thus ensuring the vaccine’s distribution among the target population. The use of aerial distribution methods allowed for a wide coverage area, reaching even the most remote and inaccessible regions where foxes roamed.
This method of vaccination was a departure from traditional approaches, which often involved trapping and inoculating individual animals—a labor-intensive and less efficient process. By contrast, the Swiss method allowed for mass vaccination of wildlife without the need for direct human-animal contact, significantly reducing the risk of transmission to veterinarians and wildlife officers.

The success of this campaign was evident when, in 1999, Switzerland was officially declared free of urban and silvatic rabies. The country’s proactive and innovative measures had paid off, and the once prevalent threat of rabies had been eliminated from its borders. The Swiss model soon became the standard for controlling and eliminating zoonotic diseases in wildlife reservoir hosts, influencing rabies control programs worldwide.
The eradication of rabies in Switzerland through the use of vaccine-laced chicken heads demonstrated the power of creative problem-solving in public health. Thinking outside the box and leveraging the natural behaviors of animals, in this case led to effective disease control strategies. This operation not only protected the health of the Swiss population but also preserved the country’s rich biodiversity by safeguarding its wildlife from the ravages of rabies.
Today, the legacy of Switzerland’s rabies eradication program continues to inspire and inform global efforts to combat zoonotic diseases. The country’s experience emphasizes the importance of innovation, collaboration, and persistence in the face of public health challenges. As the world continues to confront new and emerging infectious diseases, the lessons learned from Switzerland’s successful campaign against rabies will undoubtedly remain relevant and influential for years to come.
