MEERUT: The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) arrested three persons for alleged involvement in tiger poaching across states. This comes two months after WCCB issued a red alert against poachers and hunters in all Indian tiger reserves.
According to WCCB sources, Rindik Teronpi, 49, was nabbed from Assam's West Karbi Anglong district while her 24-year-old son, Bedasing Senar, was arrested from Meghalaya's Shillong by a special investigation team constituted to develop linkages and crack down on poachers.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe sleuths recovered 760 gms of pangolin scales from Rindik's house. 
Kalla Bawariya alias Adil Singh was apprehended by WCCB officials and Madhya Pradesh police from Sagar district on Friday.
