"We're waiting for more information because the police and forest officials have gone to the forest where the incident happened to move them to the hospital," a police officer said. 
 Meanwhile, the BJP criticised Wayanad MP and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Kerala's Left government for failing to address the increasing incidents of human-wildlife conflict in the hill district. BJP state president and the party's candidate in the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, K Surendran, alleged that both the state government and the sitting MP of the constituency have failed to address the issue. 
 Condoling the woman's death, Surendran said in a post on X: "The human-wildlife conflict in Kerala, particularly in Wayanad, is a recurring nightmare. The State Govt led by @pinarayivijayan and the MP @RahulGandhi have failed to address this crisis. "Is Rahul only interested in votes? The wild elephants came to the town more often than Rahul Gandhi came to Wayanad. He seems indifferent to human lives, enjoying his outstation visits without truly engaging with the plight of the people. It's time for Rahul Gandhi to answer for his negligence", Surendran said.
