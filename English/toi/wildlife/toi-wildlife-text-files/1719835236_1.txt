The same were seized under the Customs Act of 1962. Officials from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Western Region (WR), Navi Mumbai, confirmed the identification of the seized animals after inspection.
Since these species are not indigenous and were imported in violation of CITES and import policy, the Regional Deputy Director of WCCB, WR, issued a detention cum deportation order to send back these reptiles to Bangkok for better survival. The reptiles were subsequently handed over to SpiceJet Airlines, as stated by a DRI official. The carrier of these exotic species has been arrested. Further investigation and searches are in progress.
