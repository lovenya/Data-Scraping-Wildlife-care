Reality show contestant, Varthur Santosh, who is currently out on conditional bail after being arrested for violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, is unlikely to return to the reality show.
A source close to the development, said, “Since this is a conditional bail, Santosh will have to appear before the authorities at regular intervals or whenever he is summoned.PollWhich KGF film did you enjoy the most?KGF Chapter 2KGF Chapter 1So, his return to the Bigg Boss house is off the table, at least for now. Once you get inside the Bigg Boss house, the only way to come out is through elimination. So, his return is highly doubtful.”
Santosh, who was arrested last Monday for possession of a tiger claw pendant, in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, was granted bail on Friday. Santosh has been asked to furnish surety and appear before the investigation officer whenever summoned. Santosh headed home soon after coming out of the jail on Friday evening and chose not to address the media.
