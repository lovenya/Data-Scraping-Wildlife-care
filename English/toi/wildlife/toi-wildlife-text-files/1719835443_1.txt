PUNE: In a successful joint operation, a young male leopard that ventured into Chikali, under the jurisdiction of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), was safely rescued by a collaborative effort involving the Pune Forest Department, RESQ CT Wildlife Rescue Unit, PCMC Fire Department, and PCMC Police Department.
The rescue operation, executed with swiftness and precision, unfolded in the early morning hours as the Pune Forest Department, in conjunction with the Wildlife RESQ team, responded to an alert about a leopard sighting in a wood storage shed in Chikali around 6:30 am.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoUpon arrival, it was determined that the leopard had not entered the shed but was navigating through a nearby passage.
The feline was later located in a cattle shed adjacent to a bungalow, situated amidst a densely populated area with a mix of residential buildings and small fields. The high human density added complexity to the situation. Nachiket Utpat, Director of Wildlife Management at RESQ CT, noted, "The location presented unique challenges due to the proximity of human habitation and the dense vegetation interspaced in the area."
Given the risks involved, traditional methods like using nets were deemed impractical. The PCMC Fire Department's Bronto Skylift played a crucial role in the operation. "Using the Skylift, the team was able to safely tranquilize the leopard from a height, at a perfect angle, guided by the drone," explained DCF Mohite of the Pune Forest Department.
