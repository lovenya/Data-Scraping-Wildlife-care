Panaji: A day after 16 Kadamba Transport Corporation employees were apprehended by the forest department for violating the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, KTC chairman Ulhas Tuenkar clarified that they had merely ventured into the forest for a picnic on their day off.
“Six of the accused individuals reside within the Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. The group had organised a picnic at Salgini and their intention was not related to poaching activities,” he said.
However, they were found using fire and preparing food inside the sanctuary, contravening regulations stipulated under the Act.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo

The forest department issued the ‘Intimation of Arrest’ letter to the KTC authorities intimating them of the action to be taken against 16 Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL) employees under the Act for their alleged involvement in violating wildlife protection laws. 
The forest department has formally registered a case against all the accused under Sections 27, 30, 31, and 32 of the Act.
“All 16 employees were arrested and produced before JMFC. Further inquiry is in process,” a forest official told TOI.
On Monday, all accused employees reported to their respective duties at the KTC Margao depot. Among the accused, 10 are drivers and 6 are conductors.
