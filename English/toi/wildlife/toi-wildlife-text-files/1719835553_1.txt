KERI: The National Tiger Conservation Authority has formed a committee of experts to study and submit a report on the impact of the Kalasa-Bhandura project on environment and wildlife within a month.
The NTCA has constituted an expert committee to conduct on-site inspection at the Kalasa-Bhandura damming and diversion schemes in the forested areas of Khanapur taluka in Belagavi district of Karnataka on the tiger corridor to submit its report within a month.
The wildlife division of the Goa forest department has already issued a show-cause notice to Karnataka, as the Kalasa- Bhandura project is aimed at diverting the natural flow of water coming to the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Goa.
The NTCA has emphasised the requirement of the wildlife conservation plan by acknowledging the potential impact of the Kalasa-Bhandura project on the landscape integrity.
Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah, recently, urged the Centre to take steps on priority basis for giving the mandatory environment and wildlife clearances for their project.
The Central Water Commission has already conveyed its technical approval to the Kalasa-Bhandura damming and diversion schemes by obtaining necessary clearances. The Karnataka government has completed major works on the canals and underground tunnels necessary for facilitating diversion of Kalasa nullah water into the Malaprabha basin.
However, the damming and diversion structures that have been proposed inside the reserve forest of Kankumbi range and of the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary for diverting the Haltara, Surla and Bhandura nullahswill have serious ecological implications on the rich forest as well as the tiger corridor.
