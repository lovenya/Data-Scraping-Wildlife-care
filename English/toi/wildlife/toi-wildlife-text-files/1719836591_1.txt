“We received a tip leading to the arrest of Vishwkarma, who confessed to planning to sell the two recovered musk pods to an individual named Puran in Haryana. The arrested smuggler, along with Puran, had hunted two Alpine musk deer in Nepal and extracted their musk,” said CO Pandey. A case has been registered against the smuggler by the forest department in Khatima.
The Alpine musk deer, the state animal of Uttarakhand, holds protected status under the Wildlife Protection Act.
