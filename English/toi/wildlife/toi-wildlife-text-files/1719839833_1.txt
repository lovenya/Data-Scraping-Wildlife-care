CHIKKAMAGALURU: Several farmers from Bhyrapura and Umblebyle have found themselves in trouble after attempting to install pipelines inside a reserve forest to draw water from the Bhadra Dam backwaters for irrigation and drinking purposes. 
The farmers had planned to lay the pipeline through Aramballi Reserve Forest and Nelagadde minor forest areas using an irrigation pump and PVC pipes.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHowever, following a complaint by a wildlife activist, forest department officials filed an FIR against five individuals and seized 15 PVC pipes, said a forest officer.

The villagers maintained that they had intended to lay the pipelines alongside the main road and not inside the forest. 
Veerappagowda, a local resident, criticized the department, stating that it should reconsider their actions before proceeding. He emphasized that the region had experienced severe drought, and the pipelines were planned to provide drinking water and irrigate agricultural fields. 
Shankrappa, another resident, pointed out that the state govt had constructed a dam across the Bhadra River to supply water to dry areas, but the people who had sacrificed their lands have not benefited from it. He argued that the villagers should be given priority and allowed to use water during critical situations.
