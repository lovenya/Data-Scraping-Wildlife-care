Jamshedpur: The arrival of 35 elephants to the Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) this week has put the foresters on an alert mode. They are extra cautious, expecially after the electrocution of three elephants in Chakulia in November 2023. 
“The Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd (JBVNL) has raised the height of the overhead transmission lines at 18 separate sites in the forest to ensure safe movement of the elephants," said DFO of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, Abhishek Kumar.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoNoting that 50 plus elephants, including the newly arrived herd, are currently wandering in the sanctuary, the official said trackers are keeping an eye on the movement of the jumbos.
The DFO further said that forest guards and quick response teams (QRTs) have been asked to be vigilant to stop the elephants from descending on the foothills. The villagers living in the foothills have been asked not to tease the elephants in case any of the jumbos walk down the foothills.
“The availability of water in the natural and artificial ponds on the hills is sufficient, besides the vegetation is in abundance in the sanctuary. There's little likelihood that elephants will descend to the villages,” the DFO added. Notably, there are 100 plus waterbodies spread across the 98 sqkm sanctuary including 68 watering holes and about 40 check-dams. Further, the official said that the herd has come from the forests of West Midnapore iun West Bengal. The elephants migrate to Bengal and return to the sanctuary through the designated corridor from Burudih, which passes through Narsinghpur, Aamdapahari via Chakulia.The DFO said that around 20 elephants stay in the sanctuary round the year, but 30 to 40 migrate to Bengal and Odisha in the July-September period, and return around February-March, the DFO said.
