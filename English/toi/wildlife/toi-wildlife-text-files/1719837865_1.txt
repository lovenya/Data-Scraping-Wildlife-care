BHOPAL: Cheetahs in India need a bigger home for their cubs to run free.
Authorities have submitted a proposal to extend the protected area at Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary—the cheetahs’ home—by 541 sq km. The proposed expansion involves acquiring 369 sq km from Sheopur division and 172 sq km from Shivpuri division.
 The decision comes within 48 hours of the birth of five more cheetah cubs, taking the number of Indiaborn young to 13—half of the cheetah population in India.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoIn less than two years, they will start marking territory, either singly or in coalition.

The success of this 541 sq km expansion initiative hinges on the ability of the India-born cheetah cubs to transition successfully to hunting in the wild and reproduction. 
The 13 cubs have come as a dose of optimism for the project’s prospects, with Project Cheetah experts seeing it as a crucial step towards securing the longterm survival of the Indian cheetah population.
Madhya Pradesh govt has already expanded Kuno once earlier, adding 404 sq km to make it a 748.7 sq km sanctuary. What was meant for the lion translocation project turned out to be a snug fit to launch the cheetah mission. Now, the project’s success has outgrown its boundaries.
