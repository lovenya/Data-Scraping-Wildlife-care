Panaji: Citizens have the power to become ambassadors for wildlife preservation, said assistant conservator of forests, Paresh Porob, at the ongoing wildlife week celebrations in Panaji.
“I seek partnership for wildlife conservation from all the citizens of Goa so that they can pass on the message of protecting Goa’s forests,” Porob said.
He highlighted the ever-thinning “green line” between the local communities and the invaluable natural resources embodied by the forest personnel.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHe urged strengthening of this connection, essential for securing these resources for future generations.
“The forest serves as a vital catchment area for North Goa’s water resources with numerous hidden streams and rivers that meander through its depths. These waterways carry organic matter and silt, nurturing marine life in the Arabian Sea,” he said.
