BHOPAL: Owning an unregistered African grey parrot could land you in as serious trouble as poaching a tiger - several years in prison! The Madhya Pradesh forest department is cracking down on illegal exotic pet ownership with a crucial amendment to wildlife protection laws.
All owners of animals listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) must register with govt by Aug 31, 2024, or face severe legal consequences, say officials.
Despite the looming deadline, only six applications have been received though lakhs of CITES-listed animals are kept as pets in Madhya Pradesh, say wildlife officials. This gap between regulations and reality leaves open the potential for black marketing in exotic animals.

It specifically addresses regulation and tracking of exotic pets. Even those who register, must adhere to strict regulations on possession, transfer, birth and death of the animals.
The amendment places particular emphasis on Appendix I of CITES, which includes critically endangered species facing the highest risk of extinction due to international trade. African grey parrots (Psittacus Erithacus erithacus) - a favourite with pet lovers for its ability to mimic - is in this category, and most aren't aware of it.
The amendment introduces the Parivesh 2.0 portal (https://parivesh.nic.in/) for registration. Owners must register here and report birth, transfer and death of their pet, along with a veterinary post-mortem report. For instance, every time a grey parrot gives an egg, it has to be reported.
Madhya Pradesh has emerged as a frontrunner in implementing Section 49M, say officials.
