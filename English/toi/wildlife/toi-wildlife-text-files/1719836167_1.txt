Berhampur: Soon, tourists would know how many dolphins inhabit the Chilika Lake. The wildlife division conducted a dolphin census in the lake on Saturday.
“Over 100 personnel, including officials of wildlife, Chilika Development Authority (CDA), experts of Zoological Survey of Indian (ZSI), students of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT), Bhubaneswar and wildlife activists were engaged to count the dolphins,” said Amlan Nayak, divisional forest officer, Chilika wildlife division.
The line transect method was used primarily to count dolphins, Nayak said. The line transect method is a distance sampling technique that involves counting along a designated stretch, with the aid of GPS to precisely define the counting area.
The enumerators were divided into 18 teams and deployed across the lake. Each team consisted of five to seven persons, Nayak said. Ten teams were deployed in Chandraput area near Balugaon, while eight teams surveyed Satapada.
