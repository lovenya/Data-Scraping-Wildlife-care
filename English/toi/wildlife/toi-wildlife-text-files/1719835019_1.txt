Chennai: A seven-ft long marsh crocodile that strayed from the Nedunkundram Lake was rescued by wildlife officials at Alappakkam, near the boundary wall of the Indian Air Force station, on Wednesday.
The male crocodile, which is estimated to be around 15 years of age, was rehabilitated at Children’s Park, Guindy. The animal was said to be docile.
Chennai Wildlife Warden E Prasant said the reptile may have got disoriented from its habitat in the lake.
This is the fourth crocodile that has strayed close to human habitation from the lake. A passerby spotted the crocodile close to the compound wall and informed wildlife officials.

The park is not allowed to breed the crocodiles as per the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority of India.
 This is because their population is already stable in the wild, he said.
The one that was rescued on Wednesday has been kept in an isolated enclosure and will remain away from the gaze of visitors.
The crocodiles will be fed with fish and beef. They can withstand starvation for a month, he said.
