So I feel more connected. Though the place is believed to be close to Mumbai yet it is difficult for me to manage time from my shoots to be here. And as currently I'm not shooting so planned a small break before I resume shoots for my next project."

She shared that the city makes her feel relaxed and healed and added, "Goa is a unique and beautiful state with a rich history and culture. Its beaches, wildlife, nightlife, and cuisine make it a must-visit destination for anyone looking for a fun and memorable vacation. And as I'm growing older I'm to realise I just need more and more me time. And I'm very much in love with myself and consider it as the purest form of love. So I try enjoy every possible thing that my heart wants to. Goa for me is all about sun sand and sea. The place is all about me just flowing in the moment and the sea heals me and rejuvenates my soul."

Mridula also acted in Bollywood movies like 'Jug Jugg Jeeyo', 'Love Aaj Kal 2' among others.
