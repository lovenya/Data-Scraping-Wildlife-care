MOHALI: The scorching heat and drying dams in Mohali have led to a dire situation for the local wildlife. Animals are succumbing to the harsh conditions, with their lifeless bodies discovered near the parched beds of Perch Dam in Mohali. With the situation becoming critical, the forest and wildlife department has taken urgent measures to intervene and save the remaining wildlife.
The Siswan Wildlife Sanctuary, home to a diverse range of animals such as sambhar, wild boars, hog deer, barking deer and wild dogs, has been hit particularly hard by the water crisis. These animals are gasping for water, struggling to survive in the unforgiving conditions.

In response to this crisis, the wildlife department has taken swift action by constructing artificial water pits throughout the affected areas. These pits serve as a lifeline for the animals, providing them with a much-needed source of water to quench their thirst.
Sources within the wildlife department revealed the devastating toll the drought has taken on the local fauna. The carcasses of four sambhars, two hog deer, a barking deer, and several birds have been discovered, highlighting the severity of the situation.
The dam bed itself has become a treacherous landscape, with desiccated areas developing fissures and some parts transforming into a quagmire. Tragically, some animals have become entangled in these hazardous conditions, further emphasizing the urgent need for intervention.
The villagers of Perch played a crucial role in bringing this crisis to the attention of the forest and wildlife department. Acting as custodians of the forest area and its wildlife, they have been instrumental in assisting the department's efforts to create water holes and replenish them with water.
The department, under the guidance of officiating chief wildlife warden-cum-nodal officer Saurabh Gupta, has been working tirelessly to ensure that these water pits are regularly filled using water tankers and JCB machines.
Saurabh Gupta said, “The collaborative efforts between the wildlife department and local villagers serve as a beacon of hope amid this crisis. By excavating water pits and ensuring a consistent supply of water, we are providing a lifeline to the struggling wildlife population.”
However, the situation remains critical, and ongoing efforts will be necessary to prevent further loss of life and protect the delicate ecosystem.
This wildlife crisis in Mohali serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of climate change and the importance of conservation efforts. 
Saurabh Gupta said “As we move forward, it is imperative that we prioritize the conservation and protection of our natural resources. By implementing sustainable practices, preserving water sources, and supporting the efforts of wildlife organizations, we can work towards a future where animals can thrive in their natural habitats without the looming threat of drought and dehydration.”
