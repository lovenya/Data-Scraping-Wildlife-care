Chandigarh: Barbed wire fencing, mowing of vegetation, garbage and debris lying along the boundary wall of Rajendra Park, Sector 1 are putting the inhabiting wildlife in harm’s way, said an environmentalist, who has raised the matter before the authorities concerned.
Although the jurisdiction of the park is with the MC, the matter is related to the department of wildlife too as blue bulls also known as Nilgais (a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act) have been trapped inside the park due to the high barbed wire fencing.

Highlighting the need of a wildlife corridor, the environmentalist said, “It is extremely shocking that the MC has raised high barbed fence around the park without making a proper corridor for the wildlife. The blue bulls are forced to remain inside which is wrong and not in compliance with the wildlife norms. I have spoken to the department concerned and if things do not improve, will take the matter further.” 
He added that the grass and shrubs which have been mowed down constituted the wildlife’s habitat.

The authority concerned should either restore it or provide food to these animals," he said. 
Not only this, some of the area along the boundary wall of Rajendra Park has become a sight for sore eyes, he said, adding that heaps of garbage can be seen lying on the road from Kansal to Khuda Ali Sher. 
Notably, the MC outsources the Rajendra Park, mainly the mango orchard area for a period of six years through tenders. The hired contractor maintains the park till the validity of the contract.
