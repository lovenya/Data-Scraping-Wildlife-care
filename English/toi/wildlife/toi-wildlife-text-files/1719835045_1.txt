NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Thursday took suo motu cognisance of the forest department's shoot-to-kill order for a big cat that has been labelled 'man-eater' after it killed two women in three days in Bhimtal block last week.
The HC bench of Justices Sharad Kumar Sharma and Pankaj Purohit demanded clarity on the decision-making process and ordered the forest department to employ non-lethal measures against the animal.The court instructed the installation of cameras to identify the predatory beast, the use of cages for its capture, and, if necessary, tranquilisation and relocation to a rescue centre. 
In an embarrassing moment for the forest department, the officials present at the court failed to provide a satisfactory response when asked by the court whether the "culprit" was a leopard or a tiger. The officials said the "injury marks on the humans appear to be the work of a tiger". However, in the last seven days, locals and foresters on patrolling duty in the affected area have insisted that these were the first leopard attacks in the region in many generations.
Digging into the case, the court questioned the the chief wildlife warden's directive to declare the big cat a 'maneater', leading to its immediate extermination. The court emphasised that killing a predatory animal should be a last resort, requiring a well-thought-out decision of the chief wildlife warden rather than succumbing to public agitation. The HC also criticised the forest department for bypassing the investigative process mandated by Section 11A of the Wildlife Protection Act and questioned the immediate decision to kill without identifying the species.

"If it is still not known whether the culprit is a tiger or a leopard, then how were orders given to kill it?" the court asked.
Meanwhile, outside the courtroom, residents in Ramanagar staged a protest due to rising wildlife attacks. Demanding a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and enhanced security for the victims' families, the villagers closed the Dhela and Jhirna gates of the Corbett Tiger Reserve. They also sought free treatment and Rs 10 lakh compensation for the injured.
Lalit Upreti, chief of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, highlighted two deaths in the region and an injured individual undergoing treatment in Delhi. While emphasising support for tiger conservation, the protesters asserted that protecting wildlife should not come at the cost of human lives. 
They called for a reevaluation of the Wild Life Protection Act, urging the exclusion of tigers and leopards from the protected schedule due to the escalating instances of human-wildlife conflicts.
