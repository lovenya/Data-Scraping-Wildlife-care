NEW DELHI: Authorities in Mexico on Monday said that they are investigating the sudden deaths of endangered howler monkeys, suspecting extreme heat as a potential cause. The environment ministry said that possible reasons for the fatalities include "heat stroke, dehydration, malnutrition, or fumigation of crops with pesticides."

Temperatures soaring up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) have been recorded in the southern states of Chiapas and Tabasco, where the monkey deaths have been reported. While the government has not disclosed the exact number of primates affected, the Tabasco-based wildlife preservation group COBIUS reported "mass deaths."
"It's very likely due to climatic reasons but we cannot rule out other important causes," COBIUS said. The group also urged the public to help by providing water to weakened monkeys, suggesting, "If you see monkeys that are weak and apparently suffering from heat or dehydration, please try to hoist a bucket of water by rope for them to drink."

"The heat is very strong. Since I've been visiting these states I've never felt it as much as I do now," he said during his regular news conference.
In response to the crisis, authorities and conservationists are conducting patrols to distribute water and fruit to help the monkeys stay hydrated, according to the Tabasco civil protection institute.
