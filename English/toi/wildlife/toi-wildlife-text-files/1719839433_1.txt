PILIBHIT: A seven-month-old tiger cub was injured after being hit by a running train on Friday when she was crossing a railway line passing through Mailani forest range of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) with its mother.
On information from the forest patrolling team, divisional forest officer (DFO) Saurish Sahai, and range officer, Sajid Hussan, rushed to the spot and found the injured cub lying close to the rails.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoA case has been registered in this connection.
“A departmental case under sections of Wildlife Protection Act has been lodged against an anonymous person. Once we collect concrete evidence confirming the accident, we will book the train driver and make railway department liable for the accident,” the DFO said.
The cub sustained a muscular injury along with a deep wound on her right hind leg. After preliminary attempts at her rescue without sedation failed, veterinary officer at DTR Dr Daksh Ganwar, was called to the spot and he tranquilised the feline to shift it to a safe place inside the forest range.

The feline would remain under medical observation at Mailani forest range for a week but in case her condition does not improve, she would be shifted to a zoo for expert medical treatment. She has been kept on a chicken diet,” the DFO added. 
Notably, unlike PTR, which has signed an agreement with railway authorities to keep the train speed in jungle stretch confined to a maximum of 30 km per hour, there is no bar on it in DTR.
