Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa, currently embroiled in a major controversy over murder charges, it comes to light that additional legal troubles linked him to a wildlife case. Darshan, who was recently detained for six days in police custody in connection with the murder of Renuka Swamy, is also accused of violating wildlife protection laws.
The case against Darshan came to light when it was revealed that an FIR had been filed against him in January 2023.The actor, his wife Vijayalakshmi, and their property manager Nagaraj were accused of illegally housing four bar-headed geese at Darshan’s farmhouse in T. Narasipura, Mysuru.

A senior official from the forest department expressed disappointment over the lack of progress in the case, attributing it to the transfer of the initial investigating officer and subsequent neglect by the current officer.
The bar-headed goose is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which makes housing or capturing these birds a serious offence. Violations of this law are non-bailable offences. The official explained that, due to the high profile of the individuals involved, there has been a delay in taking decisive action.

The murder case itself has already been a shock. Darshan is accused of orchestrating the abduction and assault of Renuka Swamy, a fan who allegedly sent derogatory messages to Darshan’s friend Pavithra Gowda. Swamy was reportedly kidnapped, brutally beaten, and left to die, with his body found discarded in a stormwater drain.
