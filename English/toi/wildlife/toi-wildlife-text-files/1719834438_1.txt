Bhubaneswar: Authorities of Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary have started weeding and removing inedible grass across the length and breadth of the forest to ensure a healthy and robust herbivore population which will in turn help to boost the tiger numbers. 
Around 8,000 kg of wild indigenous grass seeds were sown over 300 to 400 hectares inside the sanctuary.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe grass varieties were to be fodder for sambar, deer and gaur. The species are dicanthium, viteveria, ischemum, cynodon, cloris, heteropogon and wild bajra. The grassland or meadow is an important component to increase the tiger population. The sanctuary has a lone Royal Bengal Tiger that has walked into the forest on its own. Anshu Pragyan Das, divisional forest officer, Hirakud wildlife division, said the sanctuary has natural regeneration of grass and spread of oplismenus species that is useful for resting of herbivores. “With guidance from grassland expert Gajanan Muratkar, we have taken up large-scale grassland management. An intensive drive is going on to eliminate inedible grass and invasive weeds like sorghum, hyptis and chloroxylon, which occupy major grazing habitats. We are taking up biomass management in areas, which have clear patches of edible grasses like viteveria and heteropogon,” she said.
After four villages — Lambipali, Kurumkel, Rengali and Bhutuli — were vacated to clear nearly 500 hectares, meadow development was taken up with the help of grassland experts. 
A survey conducted in June had revealed the overall herbivore density in Debrigarh had gone up from 29 per sq km in 2022 to 46 animals this year.
