BHOPAL: In the first case of a tiger killing and eating a man in the vicinity of Bhopal in decades, a 62-year-old man fell prey to a big cat in Obedullaganj area of Raisen district, 20km from MP's capital, on Wednesday.
Forest officials have set up 40 camera traps to track the tiger and push it back into the deep forest of Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The victim, Maniram Jatav, had gone to Ratapani's Neemkheda Kushiyari region to collect tendu leaves, disregarding forest officials' warning. His family raised the alarm when he didn't return home on Wednesday night. Forest officials found his half-eaten body in bushes in the morning.
Forest dept has given Rs 8 lakh compensation to Jatav's family and warned villagers against venturing into forest areas after sunset.
Two tigers have been sighted in Neemkheda Kushiyari in 3 months, prompting foresters to intensify their vigil. A month ago, a tiger was found prowling near the gates of a university.
