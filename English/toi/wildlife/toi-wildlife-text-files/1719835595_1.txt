BELAGAVI: In a concerning revelation, approximately 40 to 50 percent of the core areas of three major national parks in Karnataka are grappling with the invasion of exotic weeds, impacting wildlife movement and forcing herbivores to venture outside the forests in search of green fodder. 
Forest minister Eshwar B Khandre acknowledged the persistent proliferation of weeds like lantana and parthenium, despite ongoing efforts and improved management plans by the forest department.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Responding to BJP MLC Tejaswini Gowda's inquiry in the legislative council, Khandre detailed the prevalence of invasive species, including Lantana camara, Senna spectabilis, Chromolaena odorata, Parthenium, and Mikania micrantha. The dense growth of these weeds hampers the free movement of wildlife in the core areas of the national parks, creating challenges for the ecological balance.
For over a decade, the forest department has been tirelessly working on weed control, seeking scientific insights for permanent removal. The proposed method involves destroying the roots by digging four inches deep into the land. However, resource constraints limit the annual weed removal to 5,000 hectares, incurring a substantial cost of approximately Rs 87,000 per hectare.

The forest department is considering utilizing funds from the Centre’s Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to bolster these efforts.
Concerns about the impact of large weeds on prey density were raised during the annual tiger census report release in July. Tejaswini Gowda highlighted the adverse effects on grassland growth, a vital food source for herbivores such as elephants and deer. She urged the forest department to focus on cultivating only.
