CHENNAI: A salamander rescued from a smuggler at Chennai airport and housed at Children's Park, Guindy underwent a surgery at Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary to remove the stones it had ingested in its enclosure. After successful completion of the medical procedure, the movement of the animal has returned to normal and it is expected to be taken back to the Children's Park in a few days, said Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (southern region) deputy director Kirubasankar.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Josula Navukkarasu, chief veterinarian of Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary (BMAD), said most amphibians had the habit of ingesting stones and soil and this particular animal had swallowed three stones, one of them a fairly big one. It was unable to digest the stones or release them through faeces and was seen struggling for a few days.
After the wildlife crime control bureau authorities gave consent for the surgery, the salamander was shifted to the BMAD where it was given a sedative through water. After it was thoroughly sedated, a small incision was made in its body for the procedure during which the animal was wrapped in a soft wet cloth, said Josula Navukkarasu.
The procedure by a team of veterinarians lasted around 45 minutes, she said. After the stones were removed and the veterinary surgeons pronounced that the animal was alright, it was placed under observation and will continue to be monitored for the next five days. Once the health of the animal is stabilized it will be taken back to the Children's Park and released into a container filled with water, she said.
The salamander, which had been fed with earthworms at the park, was being given the same diet at the BMAD, she said. 
Salamanders in the wild feed on molluscs and orthopods, she said.
