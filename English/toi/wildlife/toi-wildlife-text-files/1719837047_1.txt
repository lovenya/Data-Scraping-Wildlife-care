Panaji: Forest minister Vishwajit Rane on Monday shot down suggestions that a human-animal conflict exists in the state. 
Rane said that unlike larger states, Goa has hardly any incidents involving wildlife. 
“There is no conflict between man and animals. If you want to see human wildlife conflict, go and see in the bigger states. The tiger’s territory is huge and it does not look at boundaries.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAnimal and human conflicts are not there in Goa, but where there are concerns of people living in forests, we will look into it,” said the forest minister.
