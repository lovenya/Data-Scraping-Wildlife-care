RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh high court has dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) that aimed to designate the Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary (BWS) as a tiger reserve and the Chilpi Range as a buffer zone.
The division bench, comprising chief justice Ramesh Sinha and judge N K Chandravanshi, delivered the verdict recently, highlighting procedural aspects and concerns related to local communities.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The court emphasized that the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had only suggested measures for the potential declaration of BWS as a Tiger Reserve and had not issued a binding recommendation. The Division Bench pointed out that the NTCA's suggestions were dependent on completing procedural formalities, which had not been fulfilled in this case.
Petitioner Nitin Singhvi, through his counsel Surya Kawalkar Dangi, challenged the rejection of the NTCA's recommendation by the Chhattisgarh State Wildlife Board to assign BWS the status of a Tiger Reserve. Dangi argued that an expert committee had been formed to determine the core and buffer areas, and the state government had given in-principle approval for the Tiger Reserve status.

However, the forest department of Chhattisgarh later revoked the proposal, citing a lack of necessary documents related to consultations with the affected local Gram Sabhas, as required under Section 38-V (ii) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
Representing the state, Advocate General S C Verma, highlighted that the NTCA's recommendations had raised concerns about the potential displacement of tribal communities and ecological disruptions. The government emphasized the need to balance wildlife conservation with the rights and livelihoods of forest-dwelling communities. Approximately 17,566 individuals residing in 39 villages would be affected if the Tiger Reserve were established, requiring significant financial resources for their resettlement.
The court's decision was primarily based on the failure to comply with legal procedures, including consultation with local Gram Sabhas and obtaining consent from the affected communities. The ruling underscores the importance of involving local stakeholders in conservation initiatives to ensure that their rights and needs are adequately addressed.
The Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary holds ecological significance and is home to various tribal communities. The court's verdict highlights the delicate balance required between conservation efforts and safeguarding the interests of local inhabitants. As the conservation discourse continues, integrating local perspectives and considerations is crucial for achieving sustainable and holistic outcomes.
