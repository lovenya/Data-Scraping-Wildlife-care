Douglas Gurr, director of the Natural History Museum, described the winning shot as “poignant” and “breathtaking.”
The “thought-provoking image is a stark reminder of the integral bond between an animal and its habitat and serves as a visual representation of the detrimental impacts of climate warming and habitat loss,” Gurr said in the release.
