PANAJI: The wildlife rescue squad at the range forest office (RFO) in Panaji has been inundated with several animal rescue calls during the first three months of 2024, according to data released by state forest department. Compared to the rest of the state, the RFO in Panaji is the most urbanised range with forests in Tiswadi and Bardez falling under its jurisdiction.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoFrom Jan to March 2024, the squad received 197 distress calls for the rescue of reptiles, mammals and avifauna that entered residential areas.
"The weather doesn't just affect human health but animal behaviour as well. Due to the soaring summer temperatures many wild animals, especially reptiles tend to venture out of their habitat into areas they consider cooler - which oftentimes turn out to be human habitation," a senior forest official said.
In Jan 2024 alone, the squad attended 38 reptile-related rescues, along with 7 mammal and 3 avifauna rescues. This escalated in Feb with 66 reptile rescues, along with 7 mammals and 3 avifauna. In March, the squad responded to 65 reptile emergencies, 5 mammals, and 3 avifauna.

Comparatively in the previous years the first three months paint a stark contrast. From 2021 to 2023 through Jan, Feb and March, the combined totals of reptile, mammal, and avifauna rescues were 352, 345, and 221, respectively.
The data reveals a downward trend in wildlife emergencies, particularly in reptile-related incidents. While the reasons behind this drop in such incidents remain unknown, the need for proactive conservation measures from wildlife authorities, conservationists, and local communities is becoming increasingly imperative.
"Enhanced public awareness and habitat restoration initiatives are crucial steps toward mitigating the escalating wildlife rescue demands and ensuring the long-term survival of diverse species," the official said.
