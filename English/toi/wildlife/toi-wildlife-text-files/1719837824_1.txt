PUNE: Wildlife SOS recently rescued a male leopard involved in a road accident on the Pune-Nashik highway, after a distress call from the Maharashtra Forest Department. 
The leopard, under the care of Wildlife SOS, is receiving medical treatment at the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC), which is run jointly by Wildlife SOS and the forest department. 
After receiving the call, the Wildlife SOS and Junnar Forest Division rescue team reached Kalamb in the Manchar forest range, where the injured leopard was discovered. When the team arrived at the spot, they saw that a huge crowd had gathered and blocked the road to witness the incident. As a result, the injured leopard was in an agitated state due to the surrounding hue & cry caused by the public. 
The rescue team then tranquilised the injured big cat using a dart gun. The leopard, estimated to be 5 years old, was then gently placed in a trap cage and transported for immediate medical care. 
Once at the leopard rescue facility, the feline underwent a thorough examination, which revealed serious head trauma, a broken mandible, and broken canines and incisors. Currently the leopard is receiving supportive therapy, oral medications and antibiotics. Though in a state of lateral recumbency, the leopard is eating well. 
Dr Chandan Sawane, Veterinary Officer at Wildlife SOS, stated, “The leopard's injuries were severe, including a broken lower mandible and fractures in both canines and incisors. Our immediate focus is on providing necessary medical care and support for its recovery. We are also providing him with the necessary feed for his ease.”
