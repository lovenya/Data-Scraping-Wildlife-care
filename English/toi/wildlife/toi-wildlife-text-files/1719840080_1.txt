In the early hours of a serene morning in Thiruvananthapuram, the city awoke to the somber news that Manu, the venerable Bengal tiger who had been a part of the local zoo's family for 17 years, had passed away. The news spread quickly, touching the hearts of the community and wildlife enthusiasts alike.
Manu's story is one that began on January 13, 2007, when he was born to his mother Karishma at the zoo.Over the years, he grew to become a majestic creature, admired by visitors and cared for by the dedicated staff. His presence was a constant, a familiar sight for those who frequented the zoo, and he was often the highlight of many a visitor's trip.
However, in December 2023, it became apparent that Manu was facing health challenges. He was diagnosed with liver-related issues, and despite the best efforts of the veterinary team led by Dr. Nikesh Kiran, his condition began to deteriorate. In his final months, Manu was fed boneless mutton, soup, and milk, a diet designed to ease his discomfort and provide him with the necessary nutrients.
As Manu aged, his resilience waned. The zoo staff made accommodations to ensure his comfort, moving him to a special cage equipped with infrared lighting to maintain warmth. Yet, even with this care, the tiger's health continued to decline, and he eventually succumbed to pneumonia, a complication arising from his underlying condition.

The loss of Manu is felt deeply by the Thiruvananthapuram zoo community. He was a symbol of the wild's beauty and the delicate balance of nature's ecosystems. His passing marks the end of an era for the zoo and is a poignant moment to reflect on the importance of conservation efforts for these magnificent creatures.
Tigers, in general, have an average lifespan of around 12 years in the wild, but in captivity, they can live longer due to the absence of threats and the availability of consistent care. Manu's 17-year journey is in due part to the care he received and the bond he shared with those who looked after him.
The zoo's commitment to providing a safe haven for animals like Manu is unwavering. While the void left by his departure cannot be filled, the legacy of his life will continue to inspire and educate future generations about the wonders and vulnerabilities of wildlife.
Manu's final rites were conducted with respect and in accordance with the regulations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority. As the zoo and its patrons mourn his loss, they also celebrate the life of a tiger that brought joy and awe to so many.
In the wake of this event, the zoo reaffirms its dedication to the welfare of its inhabitants and to raising awareness about the plight of endangered species. The memory of Manu will live on, urging us to appreciate and protect the diverse array of life with which we share our planet. His story, while unique, is part of a larger narrative that highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings and the responsibility we hold to safeguard their future.
