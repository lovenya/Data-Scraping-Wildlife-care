PANAJI: State goverment has approved the establishment of the Bondla Zoo Foundation for Goa's only zoo at the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary. Sources from the forest department said that the foundation has been registered under the Societies Registration Act.
"Once operational, the foundation will streamline administrative processes, allowing for direct allocation of funds to the zoo, bypassing the conventional route through the govt treasury.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThis autonomy is expected to facilitate more efficient utilisation of resources and expedite decision-making processes," a forest official told TOI.
While govt has tentatively sanctioned the formation of a committee under the foundation's umbrella, the official notification is pending.
