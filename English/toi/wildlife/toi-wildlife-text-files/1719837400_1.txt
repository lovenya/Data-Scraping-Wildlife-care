DEHRADUN: A leopard attack claimed the life of yet another child in Dehradun marking the ninth human fatality in less than two months in human-wildlife conflict across the state. Riasat Ali, 9, was attacked by the animal while he was outside his home in the Madari Van Gujjar Basti area at Kimadi on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road.
Witnesses said Riasat had stepped out of his hutment to relieve himself when the leopard ambushed him.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoDespite frantic efforts from family members and friends to rescue him, the boy succumbed to his injuries. The incident reignited fears among the city residents, especially those living on the outskirts of Dehradun who have been advised to exercise caution and follow appropriate wildlife coexistence measures.
Shamli Kumari, a 52-year-old resident of Sahastradhara area, expressed grave concern about the situation. "We are refraining from venturing out after sunset, but with the change in season, many people have no choice but to go out for morning and evening walks for good health. Leopard scare shouldn't confine residents indoors. There has to be a solution for this."
Dehradun district forest officer (DFO) Nitish Mani Tripathi said that measures were being taken to address the situation. "The Madari Chuk area is surrounded by forests. We have installed five cages and 30 camera traps, along with deploying teams for trapping the leopard," he said. "In case of adverse situation, permission from the chief wildlife warden has been sought to eliminate the leopard if it is not possible to capture the animal."
