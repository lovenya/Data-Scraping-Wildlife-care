Panaji: The district society for prevention of cruelty to animals (north Goa) and other animal and environment activists have written to the North Goa collector over the risks associated with the festival to the environment, wildlife and people of the village. 
Executive secretary of the society, Dexter Braganza in his letter to the collector stated that releasing paper lanterns with a live fire into the sky is a risk during the summer for people and forests, village houses and shacks, many of which have dry coconut palm thatch. 
“Lanterns, even if biodegradable, take a long time to decompose and can cause harm to wild animals and livestock who ingest or get entangled in the wire frames. The frames will end up in both the sea and on the land around the site. Birds and animals can get injured or even killed in these frames. Marine life can also get caught and perish,” he stated, adding that the ash and trash will pollute the sea and land.
