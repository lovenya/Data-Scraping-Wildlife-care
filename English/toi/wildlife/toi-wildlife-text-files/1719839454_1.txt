Nagpur: Even though Maharashtra, Chandrapur district in particular, is infamous for high number of man-animal conflicts, last year’s figures show nearly a 50% drop in human deaths and livestock kill in such cases.
Data received from the PCCF (wildlife) office under the RTI Act by social activist Abhay Kolarkar shows that in 2022-23, 111 persons died in tiger, leopard, and other wild animal attacks.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHowever, from April 2023 to February 25, 2024, (11 months), 59 human deaths were recorded in the state.

Though crop damage compensation cases have almost doubled, there is a drop in cattle kills by big carnivores. Last year, 54,036 crop damage cases were recorded compared to 1.04 lakh cases in the current year.

During the last 11 months, the number has dropped by one-third to 4,648. The data received under RTI is for six years from 2018-19 till 2023-2024.
“Even though there is a drop in cases in the last 11 months, comparative study of the last six years’ data show there is an overall increase in man-animal conflict with spurt in human deaths and animal injuries, cattle kills, and crop damage cases. In 2018-19, govt paid Rs27.43 crore towards compensation but in 2023-24, it paid Rs136.80 crore, nearly a five-fold jump,” Kolarkar said.
In 2018-19, the number of human deaths and injuries was 36, and 299 cases respectively. It has shown a consistent rise over the next four years 2019-20 (47), 2020-21 (82), 2021-22 (86), 2022-23 (111) and dropped in 2023-2024 (59).
Wildlife conservationists attributed the spurt in conflict to an increase in tiger and leopard population in the last six years. 
As per the All India Tiger and Leopard Estimation (AITE)-2018, the tiger numbers have increased from 312 in 2018 to nearly 444 in 2022. During the same period leopard numbers have also increased from nearly 1,690 to 1,985.
PCCF (wildlife) Maheep Gupta said, “It is true that 2022-23 was exceptional with 111 human deaths. This year there has been a drop in the number of cases. However, it is difficult to specify the exact reasons for the spike last year, it can be attributed to quick response by primary response teams (PRTs) to conflict situations and regular awareness drives in the Tadoba landscape.”
Gupta added, “One of the reasons for conflicts going down may be the removal of problem tigers in Gadchiroli and Chandrapur landscape. Due to better protection and control over poaching, big cat numbers outside protected areas (PAs) have increased creating frequent tiger-human interface.”
“The man-animal conflict in the twin districts is expected to go down further with the implementation of tiger translocation projects for Nagzira and Satpura tiger reserves,” Gupta added.
Chandrapur conservationist and founder of NGO Eco-Pro, Bandu Dhotre, says, “Despite several measures like subsidized LPG distribution and solar fencing in place, exploitation of natural resources continues unabated, bringing people into conflict with wildlife, both directly and indirectly. Increasing human and wild animal populations have also led to more conflict cases. The drop in conflict may be temporary and may flare up once the season for tendu leaves extraction starts next month.”
