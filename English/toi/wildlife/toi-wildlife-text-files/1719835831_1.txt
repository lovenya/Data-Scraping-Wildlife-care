Winged visitors to Punjab’s wetlands in Ropar and Nangal have reduced from last winter in the World Wildlife Fund and state forest department’s preliminary census. There will be another survey of migratory birds in 10 days.
The wildlife officials blame the current “small decline” on a late onset of winter hope for better numbers in a few days, since there are no major disturbances within and around these wetlands to discourage the avian guests from landing.Ropar’s district forest officer (DFO) Kulraj Singh said: “Ropar received 1,700 migratory birds of 40-odd species this year, down from last year’s 1,764. Nangal received 2,200-odd birds of 32 species, while700-odd landed downstream at the NFL pond. Last year year’s count was 3,135.”

WWF India senior coordinator Gitanjali Kanwar said: “The number of migratory birds at the two wetlands in Ropar district is expected to improve in 10 days, while we will monitor this population till March. Last year, a water body was under construction and repair, while we had no major disturbance of this kind this year.”

The Nangal wetland received 3,797 water-dependent birds of 43 species (six resident and 37 migratory) in 2021, while in 2020, it received 4,553 birds of 33 water-dependent species. In 2019, it had received 4,110 birds of 25 species.
Common migratory waterbirds of the Ropar and Nangal wetlands include red-crested pochard, grey-legged geese, Eurasian coot, bar-headed geese, gadwall, ruddy shelduck, northern pintail, common pochard, northern shov-eller, and mallard.
Punjab has seven protected wetlands. Of these, six have been declared Ramsar sites, or wetlands of international importance — Harike Wildlife Sanctuary, Nangal Wildlife Sanctuary, Ropar Conserva-tion Reserve, Kanjli Wetland, Beas River Conservation Reserve, and Keshopur-Miani Community Reserve.
The seventh, Ranjit Sagar Dam Conservation Reserve, is recognised as a national wetland. The collective count ofmigratory birds visiting Ramsar wetlands fell to 85,882 in 2022-23, against 95,928 recorded in 2021-22, a fall of 10.47%. Kanjli wetland registered the highest fall of nearly 49.49%.
Experts attributed the downwand trend of migratory bird arrivals to changes in weather pattern and local disturbances that have occurred within and areas surrounding these wetlands. 
These zones are under extreme stress due to construction activity, encroachment, change of landscape, and water pollution. However, avian migration is a complex issue, as these birds cross nearly 30 countries to reach the Indian subcontinent every winter.
