DEHRADUN: A tiger killed a woman in the Dhela range of Corbett Tiger Reserve on Sunday evening, the second such in the area in two days and the fifth human casualty in wildlife attacks in Uttarakhand this month.
Durga Devi, 45, along with fellow villagers, was collecting fuelwood inside the reserve around 4pm when a tiger ambushed her and dragged her into the forest.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoDhela ranger Ajay Dhyani said foresters managed to scare off the tiger after firing 20-25 rounds in the air, allowing them to recover Durga's body from 4km inside the core zone of the reserve. Living alone after her husband's demise, Durga had a daughter settled in Almora. Dheeraj Pandey, director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, said, "The forest department is now taking preventive measures, installing cameras and cages in the area. Patrol teams are ready to tranquillise the tiger if spotted." 
The forest department faced upheaval following the news of Durga's demise. The department responded by dispatching staff to the scene and sending the body for post-mortem.
