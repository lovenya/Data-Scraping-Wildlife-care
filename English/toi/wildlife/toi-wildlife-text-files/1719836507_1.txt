Jamshedpur: The canopy walk facility at the Dalma sanctuary will be set up by mid-February. The 100 meter long facility at a height of 25 feet will be in convoluted form with two base points, and two exit points in between, said divisional forest officer (DFO), Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, Abhishek Kumar.
The facility, which is being set up at the Nature Information Center, (NIC), at Makulakocha has been built at a cost of Rs 32 lakh.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The facility will aide nature lovers, particularly, the people who study bird species. The bird watchers can spend long hours clicking pictures of the birds from close, and, can record their behavioural pattern in cameras, the DFO said.
Kumar said necessary safety measures will be followed to ensure that people of all age groups enjoy walking on the bridge-like structures. A senior forester said the sanctuary took the initiative to set up the canopy walk following suggestions from visitors. “A lot of eco tourists who stay overnight at the sanctuary guest house were keen on having a canopy walk in Dalma,” said Kumar. The ticket cost for the canopy walk will be determined shortly. The unemployed youths of the villages in the foothills will earn employment with the start of the facility, he said.
