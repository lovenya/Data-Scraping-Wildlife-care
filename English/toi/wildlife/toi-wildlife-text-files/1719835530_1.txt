Daltonganj: The residents of the eight villages located on the fringes of the Betla National Park but within the Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) graze their cattle in the park area, impacting the life and habits of the wildlife, especially bisons, found in the PTR.
The eight villages are Pokhree, Garee, Kuchila, Kaer, Matnag, among others.
The deputy director (North division) of the Palamu Tiger Reserve, P K Jena, said, “Bisons are territorial and treat the pet cattle as intruders.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAlso, the cattle eat the grasses meant for our wildlife.”
“The boundary dividing the villages and Betla is long and porous. The problem of cattle grazing can be curtailed if the local administration begins raising patches of meadows and pastures for the cattle under the ‘Pashu Dhan Yojna’ or the ‘MGNREGA’,” he suggested.
