Nagpur: The online booking for wildlife safari in Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra, Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary (UKPWS) and Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR) will start on October 21.
Jungle safaris were closed in Pench and Bor from June 15, 2023, to September 30, 2023, due to the monsoon season. In UKPWS, wildlife safari was available depending on the weather conditions during the monsoon season.
Since the conclusion of the monsoon season, the safari started from October 1 in Pench, Bor and Umred-Karhandla but as the online website was not ready, entry to tourists was available offline.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoNow tourists can book online safaris on safaribooking.mahaforest.gov.in tnn
