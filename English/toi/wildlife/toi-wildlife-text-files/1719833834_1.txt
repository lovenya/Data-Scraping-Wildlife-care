Nagpur: In a major breakthrough, the Assam police have nabbed a mother-son duo involved in the smuggling of skins and body parts of tigers killed earlier this year in Maharashtra by various gangs of poachers from Haryana & Punjab.
Sources said those arrested are notorious wildlife smuggler Rindik Teringpi and her son Bidasingh Senar. 

Top sources told TOI these tiger skin traders seem to be a big catch as their cell numbers were found prominently in the call detail records (CDRs) of the Bawaria poachers, who killed at least four tigers in Gadchiroli and Chandrapur landscape.The case has been handed over to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB).
Both Teringpi and Senar hail from Gita Langkok village in Assam. While Teringpi was arrested from her home in West Karbi Anglong district, Senar was arrested from Shillong, Meghalaya. “The police seized 7.50kg pangolin scales from Teringpi,” WCCB sources said.
“The mother-son duo seem to be part of the inter-state and international wildlife smuggling racket, and are related to the poaching of tigers in Maharashtra,” they told TOI.
Recently, a team from Maharashtra was in Assam. The team trailed these traders but failed to track them down, though it managed to bring five Bawaria poachers on transit remand. These poachers were arrested by Assam police on June 29 with tiger skin and 19kg of tiger bones. It is to be seen now whether the team from Maharashtra brings these traders to Gadchiroli or not.
Both the accused have been booked under various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972. North-eastern states seem to be the biggest wildlife body parts smuggling market from where the contraband is later smuggled to countries like Myanmar, China, and other Southeast Asian countries.
