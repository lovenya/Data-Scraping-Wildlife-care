BENGALURU: The Karnataka government has granted a three-month amnesty to individuals to surrender artefacts made from the body parts of wild animals, including pelts. The decision was announced after a cabinet meeting on Friday, to offer a one-off opportunity to avoid legal repercussions of possessing such items.
Forest minister Eshwar Khandre warned that upon expiry of the three-month amnesty, legal action will be initiated against all those who fail to comply. 
There has been heightened public scrutiny and criticism of the state administration recently in the wake of the arrest of contestant Varthur Santosh during the filming of the Kannada reality television show.

Under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, the illegal storage, transportation, sale, and wearing of body parts of wild animals constitute punishable offences. In 1973 and 2003, the state government had allowed 30 and 180 days' time, respectively, for individuals in possession of such items to declare the same and obtain a certificate from the forest department. However, owing to a lack of awareness among the public over the legal restrictions, many still continue to keep these items in their possession. Khandre said the government's intention to provide an opportunity to all those who are unaware of the rules. He said: "In order to give such people a chance, the cabinet has taken this decision." He urged the public to take advantage of this opportunity.
