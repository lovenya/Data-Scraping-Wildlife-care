The police inspector in charge of Sector 49 police station during the filing of the report was transferred.
The case was filed based on a complaint from an animal rights group. Five people were arrested at a banquet hall in Sector 51, where nine snakes, including five cobras, were rescued, along with suspected snake venom.
Yadav was not at the party, but police were looking into his possible involvement in the snake venom case.
Maneka Gandhi, chairperson of People For Animals and a BJP leader, accused Yadav of illegally selling snake venom and demanded his arrest.
On November 4, Yadav was briefly questioned by police in Kota, Rajasthan, while traveling with friends in a car, but he was released shortly after
