Gurgaon: A sambar deer (Ruse unicolor) has been captured on a camera trap near Mangar Bani for the first time. Though the animal is not very rare in the region, it was never sighted in Mangar forestland earlier. According to a Wildlife Institute of India (WII) study in 2016, Ghamroj recorded sightings of hyena, palm civet and sambar. 
“Sambar recorded in camera traps is the first record of occurrence of the species in Gurgaon Aravalis,” the report had stated.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The deer, the largest found in the country, is native to the Indian subcontinent and is on IUCN’s Red List as a “vulnerable” species. The animal is usually confined to very dense forest and its sighting near human habitation is very rare. 
Sunil Harsana, an animal enthusiast and wildlife researcher who spotted the deer on the camera trap, said the deer took him by surprise. Along with teammate Nitesh Kaushik, Harsana has installed nine cameras in and around the Asola Bhatti Wildlife sanctuary and the Aravalis in Mangar in a project funded by the Coexistence Consortium. “This is very refreshing as sambar was never spotted in Mangar before. The camera traps have also captured striped hyena, nilgai, jackal, leopard and Indian golden jackal, among the other wild animals,” he said.
