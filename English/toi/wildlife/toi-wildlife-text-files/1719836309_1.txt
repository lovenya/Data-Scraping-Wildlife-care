“I am super excited to do the job. Our association with nature is very old. We have been listening to stories about wild animals from our grandparents. So, it is not an issue to deal with the tourists and guide them,” said Margaret.
Anshu Pragyan Das, divisional forest officer (Hirakud wildlife division) said the duo will prove to be the most spontaneous naturalists in Debrigarh. 
“They knew about half of the forest and wildlife even the training. We supplemented with some requirement that will polish their behaviour and bring grace to the job,” the DFO said.
In winter, the sanctuary witnesses massive footfall of tourists, who come from different parts of India and other countries. 
The prime attraction is the safari, cruise and welcoming local communities. In terms of revenue earning from eco-tourism, Debrigarh till December-end has earned more than Rs 2.5 crore.
Wildlife sighting has increased manifold, including leopard. Also, bison, sambar, spotted deer, wild boar, bear and peacocks are seen in Debrigarh.
