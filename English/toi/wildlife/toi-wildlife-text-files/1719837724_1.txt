As many as 268 bird species were identified in a field survey led by the Wayanad Wildlife division. The survey, held between January 26 and 28, was supported by several research institutes across Kerala and bird enthusiasts sampled the whole of the Wayanad region. According to Vishnu, conservation biologist, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, apart from native birds, a large number of migratory birds were also spotted during the survey.
"Usually we do surveys in protected areas; this time, we covered other areas, too. The birds are indicators of climate change, which we can identify through them. The number of species was the biggest takeaway for us. We spotted many migratory birds, including the rare sightings of red-breasted and tyga flycatchers that come from high elevation areas like Kashmir valley. The rarely-spotted black stork was also seen during the survey," says Vishnu.
