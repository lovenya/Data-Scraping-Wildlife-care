KANPUR: Police have arrested two poachers and detained two minors in connection with a viral video which purportedly showed them carrying the migratory Siberian birds in the riverbed of the Ganga in Maharajpur area of the district.
The accused, identified as Vinod (28) and Rampal (45), have been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act and sent to jail, while two minors, who have been taken into custody, were produced before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWe are now waiting for JJB's order for further action against them," said Maharajpur police inspector Abhishek Shukla.
