Margao: Concerns about striking a balance between sustainable tourism and wildlife conservation were voiced at an interactive session held by the state forest department on Wednesday.
“Goa is going through a crisis, we are at a crossroads. While we need sustainable tourism and aren’t hostile to visitors, the very reason for which people come to Goa shouldn’t be compromised at any cost,” Manoj Borkar, associate professor, zoology, said.He was delivering a talk on “Wildlife Conservation — Opportunities and Strengths.”
Expressing disdain for the trend to bandy the term ‘sustainability’ largely to further developmental projects, Borkar said, “Sustainability cannot be on paper.” 
He added, “Sustainability is all about being happy with the way you lead your life without interfering with the prospects of the next generation.”

The recent controversy over the issue of declaring Goa’s protective areas as a tiger corridor also found an echo in the session.
“People’s representatives also have certain electoral compulsions,” Borkar said in his lecture. “Within the (small) 3,702 sq km of the state’s geographical territory, we want industries, we want settlement, we want agriculture, we want tourism, and we want mining. And we also want to protect our forests.”
 “This isn’t easy. Also, we want to take care of the incremental demography and the floating population. A conservation mandate has to deal with all these issues.”
