Chennai: The customs wing at Chennai airport has added two more sniffer dogs specialised in detecting wildlife and narcotic substances to its K-9 squad.
The strength of the K-9 squad, which was reduced to two following the retirement of sniffer dog Irina in November, has now increased to four. 
The dogs, both labradors named Snow Boy and Rock, have successfully completed their nine-month training at Attari border and were inducted into the squad earlier this week. 
Each sniffer dog will have a dedicated caretaker and will be stationed in air conditioned cabins in between the surveillance.

In December last year, they helped a team nab a Ugandan national carrying 5.35 crore worth of drugs.
The customs department had decided to increase sniffer dogs specialised in wildlife and narcotics to address the growing challenges. Smugglers of exotic pets based in Bangkok, Thailand often choose Chennai as their port of entry as the flying time to the Tamil Nadu capital is shorter compared to other airports.
