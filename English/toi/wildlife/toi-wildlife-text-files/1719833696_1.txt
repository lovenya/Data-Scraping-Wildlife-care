Bhopal: Project Cheetah is about to enter the next phase with a second batch from South Africa expected in a few months. These cheetahs will be taken to Gandhisagar Sanctuary in MP’s Mandsaur.
A delegation, led by director general of forests, special secretary Chandra Prakash Goyal, and Dr SP Yadav, member secretary of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and head of Project Cheetah, recently concluded a 10-day mission to South Africa to further the agenda of the project and to exchange crucial insights into wild cheetah management.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The delegation, comprising 10 representatives from the Indian Forest Service, engaged in a series of discussions and field visits to national parks, game reserves, and wildlife lodges across South Africa.
Goyal and Dr Yadav were involved in high-level meetings and tours, focusing on enhancing the strategies and initiatives of Project Cheetah. Madhya Pradesh’s chief wildlife warden Aseem Shrivastava, who led a team of eight officers representing wildlife managers and veterinarians from several protected areas in India, participated in reserve visits and contributed to cheetah capture operations. This collaborative effort aimed to foster an exchange of ideas on effective wild cheetah management practices.

Vincent van der Merwe, a South African consultant for Project Cheetah and director of The Metapopulation Initiative (TMI), played an important role in organizing the itinerary and facilitating interactive sessions during the tour. The TMI staff provided substantial support to the delegation at each location, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the nuances of South African wildlife conservation efforts.
The itinerary commenced at Mountain Zebra National Park, where these officers engaged in field exercises, including cheetah tracking and inspections of fencing and bomas alongside the South African National Parks (SANParks) rangers.
At Kuzuko Lodge, the delegation gained valuable insights into the South African metapopulation of cheetahs, which potentially could contribute to the expansion efforts of Project Cheetah in southern Africa.
Furthermore, the senior members of the delegation visited Mabula Private Game Reserve, actively participating in cheetah darting, collaring, and tracking exercises. Similarly, at Dinokeng Private Game Reserve, the Indian Forest Service officers observed the darting and collaring procedures conducted by South African veterinarians during the twilight hours, illustrating the challenges and intricacies associated with managing the South African metapopulation under less than ideal conditions.
The visit to Hopewell Private Game Reserve provided the Indian delegation with a firsthand understanding of the various methodologies employed for the management of wild cheetahs, including the utilization of helicopters for assistance.
During their stay, Goyal and Dr Yadav also held a crucial meeting with senior officials from the South African Department of Environment, Fisheries, and Forestry to discuss the progress of Project Cheetah and outline the next steps for the initiative.
Concluding their visit, the Indian officials had the opportunity to observe wild cheetahs in four distinct biomes of South Africa, namely the Semi-desert Karoo, open grasslands at Tiger Canyons, dense thicket vegetation at Hopewell, and woodland savanna at Dinokeng and Mabula. Additionally, Goyal and Dr Yadav visited the Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre – DeWildt, which is renowned as the oldest and most enduring conservation program for cheetahs in Africa.
This visit provided the Indian delegates with an invaluable understanding of the best practices for cheetah husbandry in captive conditions, contributing significantly to their insights into comprehensive wildlife management strategies.
The successful visit to South Africa has not only strengthened the relationship between India and South Africa in the field of wildlife conservation but has also facilitated the exchange of knowledge and expertise crucial for the sustainable management and conservation of the endangered cheetah population.
