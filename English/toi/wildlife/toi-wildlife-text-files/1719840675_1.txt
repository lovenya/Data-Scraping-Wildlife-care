JAMMU: A fire has been devastating the Kaldi forest Area in Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir for three days, causing extensive damage to the region's wildlife and vegetation. 
The fire has spread uncontrollably, reaching the roadside and destroying a vast number of trees and plants. The Kaldi forest area is home to a significant population of peacocks and the fire has undoubtedly harmed these magnificent birds. 
The loss of vegetation has not only impacted the peacocks but also other wildlife and the overall ecosystem. This uncontrolled blaze has destroyed crores of rupees worth of forest resources, with the delay in containing the fire being attributed to alleged negligence by the Forest Department and the Fire and Emergency Department.
Arti Sharma, chairman of the Block Development Council (BDC) of Ghordi in Udhampur district, has urged the administration to promptly combat the Kaldi forest fire. 
She highlighted the urgent need for action due to the presence of a large number of peacocks and other wildlife in the area. The ongoing fire has caused significant damage to these creatures, emphasizing the immediate intervention required to protect them and the environment.
