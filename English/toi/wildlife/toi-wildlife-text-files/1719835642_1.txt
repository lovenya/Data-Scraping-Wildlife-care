Pradhan wrote Khinda is the birthplace of freedom fighter Veer Surendra Sai, who led a revolt against the British. His birthplace is an important destination for history enthusiasts. 
Similarly, Debrigarh, situated between the Hirakud dam and reservoir, boasts not only of a breathtaking landscape but also holds historical importance due to its association with Sai. He had utilised Barapahad, located within the sanctuary, as his base during the rebellion against the British. TNN
