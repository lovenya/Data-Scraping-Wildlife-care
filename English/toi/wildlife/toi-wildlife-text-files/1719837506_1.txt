Panaji: After Goa Foundation (GF) went to the high court challenging handling of ore at Kalay railway station which falls within the Bhagwan Mahaveer wildlife sanctuary, the station master and South Western Railway on Monday agreed that until they get permission from the chief wildlife warden, Goa, for loading and unloading of minerals, there will be no further handling of ore at the station.The station master further stated that only the remaining 2,025 metric tonnes of ore will be transported from the station to the Ardem jetty. 
The station master, South Western Railway, and the transporters stated that they will apply within a week to the wildlife warden under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, for transportation of ore from Kalay railway station to the Adrem jetty.
Senior advocate S Kantak representing M/s Dessai logistics stated that he has applied to the state chief wildlife warden for permission to transport the ore to the jetty. The HC meanwhile has kept all contentions open and the chief warden has agreed to dispose of the applications within four weeks from the date of their filing.
The NGO in their public interest litigation (PIL) submitted that the activities of unloading and loading cause disturbance and damage to the vegetation and wildlife due to the larges scale movement of mining trucks in the sanctuary.

Due to disturbances in the sanctuaries, wildlife including bison and leopards are now venturing onto public places including roads where mining trucks don’t follow any regulations, the NGO stated. It added that the trucks often are overloaded and not covered, creating a nuisance for people residing in these areas.
