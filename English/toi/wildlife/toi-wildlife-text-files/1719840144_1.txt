DEHRADUN: Wildfires raging through Uttarakhand's forests pose a significant threat to the state's diverse wildlife. Home to numerous species, including tigers, elephants, leopards, and a variety of birds and reptiles, the region is witnessing ecological distress. 
Concerns loom large, especially for avian and reptilian inhabitants restricted in movement pace who are unable to escape the blaze in time.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoDespite the severity of the situation, the forest department is yet to provide comprehensive data on the extent of injuries or deaths among wildlife caused by wildfires.
According to environmental photographer Anup Sah, wildfires have resulted in the tragic loss of numerous bird species, including nesting ones. In the Sitalakhet area of Almora district, Sah reported witnessing charred bird carcasses, painting a grim picture of the devastation.
"During the summer months, both local and migratory bird species from the plains and southern regions of the country flock to the hills to nest and breed. The occurrence of wildfires resulted in the tragic loss of numerous birds, including those in the process of nesting and hatching eggs," he said.

"Given the already low population numbers of yellow-headed tortoise, the loss of even a few individuals could be detrimental to the species' survival. It is likely that some of them would have burned out during relative dormancy beneath the Sal leaves," he said.
Gajendra Pathak, associated with the Jungle Bachao Jeevan Bachao movement, highlights the broader ecological impact of the wildfires. Burning leaves not only harms wildlife but also disrupts the humus layer, which is essential for soil health and preventing erosion. The loss of insects like beetles, ants, and spiders further complicates the delicate ecological balance.
"While the state had lost 1,190 hectares of forest land over a period of six months, the forest department is yet to share the data of injuries/death due to these blazes yet," Pathak said.
