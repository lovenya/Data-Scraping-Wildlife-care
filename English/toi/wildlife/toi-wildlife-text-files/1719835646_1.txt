NAINITAL: The tigress tranquillised and captured on December 25 in the Jangliagaon area in Bhimtal is responsible for the killing of three women in 13 days last month, a report from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) confirmed on Tuesday. Forensic analysis of samples sent to WII matched evidence from all three incidents, marking the tigress as the "culprit".
Talking to TOI, Samir Sinha, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, said, "The report by WII confirms all three victims were killed by the tigress recently trapped by our staff." The juvenile tigress will be under captivity at the Dhela rescue centre in Corbett Tiger Reserve.
Meanwhile, Laxman Singh Gangola, head of Maluvatal village, expressed fears among villagers due to frequent big cat sightings. However, distinguishing between leopards and tigers remains a challenge.
Sanjeev Bhagat, a Bhimtal resident, reported regular leopard sightings from October to December, emphasizing a shift in the behaviour of big cats. Bhagat urged officials to defuse the panic among locals caused by rumour-mongering.
Radha Kulyal, head of Jangliagaon village, echoed the concerns despite the tigress being captured, and asked officials to install more cameras for continuous monitoring of big cat movements. A team is patrolling the area continuously to ensure public safety.
On December 7, Indira Devi from Maluvatal village was killed by the tigress. Just two days later, Pushpa Devi in Pinro village was killed in an ambush. On December 20, Nikita Sharma was killed by an animal in Tada village.
