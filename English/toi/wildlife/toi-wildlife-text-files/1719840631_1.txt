Among the confiscated animals were iguanas, sun conures, agapornis birds, Kenyan sand boas, savannah lizards, emperor scorpions, tarantula spiders, yellow monitors, black kites, and water monitors. Another suspect was arrested, and samples from over 40 animal species were seized from the gang.
The arrested individuals were found to have created fake accounts on the Parivesh 1.0 and Parivesh 2.0 portals, facilitating the illegal trade of rare foreign animal species across various Indian states without proper documentation.
The operation and subsequent arrests were conducted under Sections 49M and 49Q of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.
The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change has implemented the Living Animal Species (Reporting and Registration) Rules 2024, under which ownership transfers, births, and deaths of living animal species listed in Appendix I, II, and III of Schedule IV must be registered through the Parivesh 2.0 portal. 
The deadline for registration is August 31, 2024. After this date, individuals without a registration certificate will face legal consequences.
Pet shop owners are also directed to ensure that they do not sell unregistered CITES-listed species and that all sales are documented through Parivesh 2.0. Violations of these rules will result in legal action.
This announcement comes from the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal. The public is advised to avoid purchasing any CITES-listed living animals that are not registered in the Parivesh 2.0 portal, as stringent measures will be taken against violators to protect wildlife and prevent illegal trade.
