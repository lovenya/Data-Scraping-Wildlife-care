Daltonganj: A team of 28 personnel of the Palamu Tiger Reserve underwent a three-day special training to capture wildlife at Kanha Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh. The team comprised PTR officials, forest guards, among others.
PTR deputy director (north) P K Jena said, “The team has returned after the fruitful three-day training from September 7. We learnt about the BOMA technique, which is used in African countries to capture wildlife and house them at some conducive environment to strengthen the prey base.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWe will try the technique to capture cheetals, which are found in large numbers at Betla which lies in the reserve’s North division. The South division lacks cheetals.”
