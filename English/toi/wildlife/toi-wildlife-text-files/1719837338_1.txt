Dehradun: The forest department data shared with the media on Saturday indicates a decrease in human-wildlife conflicts in Uttarakhand in 2023. The Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation Cell reported the lowest number of deaths and injuries in these conflicts last year.
In 2021, 71 people lost their lives, 82 in 2022, and 66 in 2023. Over the three years, 219 people died, with snakes claiming the most (85), followed by leopards (63), tigers (35), and elephants (27).PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoDespite this, wildlife attacks on humans remained consistently above 300 in all three years.
Chief Wildlife Warden Samir Sinha said, “The analysis shows the department is heading in the right direction. We've used science, field knowledge, and optimised resources. Targeted intervention is key for the future.”
Among all animals, tiger-related killings have increased, contrasting with a decline for other animals. Over the last three years, human conflict with tigers in the state rose, with two deaths in 2021, 16 in 2022, and 17 in 2023.

A new trend is being observed that tigers are exploring new spaces, colonising new areas, and presenting new challenges. We need to be more proactive in managing tiger-related issues,” Sinha added.
Authorities emphasised the importance of hotspot mapping down to the species level in controlling conflicts. This helped plan interventions, including resource and fund allocation. For the current financial year, Rs 7 crore has been allocated for modern equipment.
The establishment of the country’s first human-wildlife conflict mitigation cell and corpus fund, along with 65 Quick Response Teams and 548 Village Voluntary Protection Teams, helped control the situation. “At least 300 plus calls were received in the cell,” added authorities.
