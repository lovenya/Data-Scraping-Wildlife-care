KERI: A Gray Slender Loris, one of the species of endangered primates, was rescued by wildlifers in Nagve, Sattari. This near-threatened species is on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and has been included in the Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.
Varsha Parwar, who had spotted the animal near her house, immediately informed her mother Chandravati.When wildlifer Pradeep Gawandalkar received the information, he immediately rushed to the spot. Chandravati and her family members performed puja and handed over the animal to the wildlifers. 
Amrutsingh, president of Animal Rescue Squad of Bicholim, who was present in Nagve, told TOI, “There are superstitions with regards to the Gray Slender Loris, and villagers follow it even today. We convinced the family to hand over the animal and released it back into its natural habitat. Increasing forest clearances to undertake horticultural crops and construction activities have posed a threat to the habitat of the Slender Loris.”
Wildlifers released the animal after informing range forest officer of Valpoi, Shyamsundar Gawas.

The Gray Slender Loris inhabits rain forests and dry semi-deciduous forests. Not much is known about the animal’s behaviour. However, the animal is nocturnal and emerges from its roost cavity only at dusk. 
They primarily eat insects, but also occasionally relish on fruits, flowers and minor animals.
