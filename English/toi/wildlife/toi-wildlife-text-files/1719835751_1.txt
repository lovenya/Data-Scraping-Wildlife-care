According to wildlife experts, incidents of snake bites have increased due to erratic climatic events and urbanisation close to forest areas. 
Anup Malik, head of forest force (HoFF) of Uttarakhand forest department, said, "Another reason is that since people are now aware that they get compensation if casualties pertain to snake bites, more such incidents have been reported."
Regarding the increase in tiger attacks, Malik said, "Growing tiger population, spilling outside the protected forest areas, has led to this. We have already started a landscape-based approach to manage the wildlife."
