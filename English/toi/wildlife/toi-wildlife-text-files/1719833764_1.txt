Vihaan's winning photograph captures a spider in an intriguing position with a sculpture of Lord Krishna, nestled on the outskirts of his city. The image is not only striking but also thought-provoking. It wonderfully captures the spider, seemingly entranced by the divine notes of Krishna's flute. This captivating image stood out among the 50,000 entries from 95 countries, ultimately earning Vihaan the coveted award in the under-10 category.
Vihaan's winning entry will become part of the prestigious WPY59 collection and be prominently featured in the upcoming Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition at the Natural History Museum.

What I like most is the thought process behind it and the composition of the image. It talks about coexistence very nicely. The inclusion of a historic sculpture adds a different dimension to the concept. Then here we are, seeing a spider - a smaller and less attended life form. So, for me, this one served the purpose of art, concept, conservation and science very nicely.” 
According to sources, Vihaan's journey for this award began during a visit to a temple near Bangalore, where he chanced upon an ornamental tree trunk spider in the midst of trapping its prey. This awe-inspiring moment unfolded against a wall adorned with a sculpture of Lord Krishna, evoking a sense of connection between nature and spirituality.
Further, “Ten-year-old Vihaan started photography three years ago. He likes to use both macro and telephoto lenses in his work. Vihaan enjoys going on safari as well as capturing images of spiders and insects at the nearby parks in Bengaluru. Alongside photography, he’s also interested in studying astronomy", Natural History Museum website wrote.
