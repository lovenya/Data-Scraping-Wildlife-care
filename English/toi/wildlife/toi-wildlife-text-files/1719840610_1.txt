A recent event at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, caught the attention of the nation. During the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his third term, a video went viral showing an unidentified animal roaming in the background. The ceremony, held on a Sunday, was a grand affair with about 8,000 guests, including foreign leaders, dignitaries, business magnates, and film stars.However, the spotlight unexpectedly shifted to a mysterious creature that appeared while BJP MP Durga Das Uikey was greeting President Droupadi Murmu.
The speculation that the video created was intense, with some Twitter users asserting that the animal’s size and gait suggested it was indeed a leopard. Others joked about the animal, with one user humorously calling it the “Chief Mouser to the Rashrapati Bhavan” and another suggesting it was there to get a rank in the state ministry
One post on X, from journalist Sneha Mordani (@snehamordani) on June 10, 2024, added fuel to the fire with the caption: “An animal, allegedly a leopard, was spotted walking at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. This happened when MP Durga Das was carrying out official procedures on stage.” The video clip that was included in the post rapidly went viral on social media.

The President’s Estate, covering 330 acres, is known for its rich biodiversity, which includes open spaces, forests, parks, gardens, fruit trees, and water bodies, supporting a wide variety of flora and fauna. Within the estate is a 75-acre nature trail with the goal of raising awareness of the need to conserve nature. This pathway connects to the gardens of Rashtrapati Bhavan via well-maintained trails and offers a combination of managed and natural ecosystems. It has a peacock point, a mango orchard, a butterfly corner, a forest region, and a pond environment. 136 plant and 84 animal species, including snakes, lizards, and frogs, can be found along the walk. Thus, it is not entirely surprising that the creature trespassed the momentous ceremony and made national headlines.
Despite the playful banter and concern on social media, the Delhi forest and wildlife department stepped in to clarify the situation. They confirmed that the animal was not a leopard but more likely a domesticated cat or dog. This clarification helped to calm the public’s curiosity and refocused attention on the political significance of the ceremony.
The swearing-in ceremony marked the beginning of Prime Minister Modi’s third term, where he pledged to serve the 140 crore citizens of India and work towards the nation’s progress. The ceremony also saw the oath of office and secrecy administered to a 72-member Council of Ministers, which included 30 cabinet ministers, 36 Ministers of State, and five Ministers of State with independent charge.
This peculiar incident at the Rashtrapati Bhavan will be remembered for its unexpected twist during a momentous occasion. It is a reminder of the unpredictable nature of live events and the power of social media in shaping public discourse. The quick response from the forest department helped dispel the myths and brought clarity to the curious case of the mysterious animal at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
