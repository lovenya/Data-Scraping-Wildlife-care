District forest officer (Baghpat) Vandana Phogat said, "Locals reported a trapped leopard, and an expert team conducted a meticulous operation to successfully rescue the injured animal. The leopard is currently under medical observation and treatment." The Shamli leopard is identified as a female, approximately two and a half years old, while the Baghpat leopard is a male of around one and a half years. Both leopards sustained injuries while trying to free themselves from the traps.
Authorities are investigating the traps set in farmers' fields, initially targeting wild boars and nilgai.

Notably, leopard sightings in Shamli and Baghpat districts are rare occurrences, according to locals.
