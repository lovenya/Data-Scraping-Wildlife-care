SRIKAKULAM: Tension has gripped the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) regions, particularly the Gajapati district in Odisha and sections of the Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, due to the presence of a tiger. 
The incident unfolded after the big cat killed a cow on October 19 in the Santoshipuram village, located in the Rayagada block of Gajapati district in Odisha. 
Upon receiving reports from locals, forest officials deployed trap cameras, which captured images of the elusive tiger. Murali Krishna, the forest range officer in Kasibugga, told TOI that the tiger is the same one that has been causing apprehension in the North Coastal Andhra districts over the past year.
"It is currently within the boundaries of Odisha and has not crossed into Andhra Pradesh. Odisha's forest authorities have confirmed its presence through the discovery of the tiger's hair at the site where it killed and consumed a cow, along with the animal's paw prints. The public in Patapatnam, Meliaputti, and Mandasa mandals have been alerted to the situation. While there isn't adequate shelter in the Kasibugga and Patapatnam forests for these large cats, they do have a dense and secure forest environment in Odisha," Murali Krishna said.
