GUWAHATI: After 40 years, rhinos have returned to stay at Laokhowa and Burachapori wildlife sanctuaries of greater Kaziranga, Assam, following a massive eviction through which 1,282 hectares of forest and government land were cleared of illegal settlements last year.
Until 1983, Laokhowa-Burachapori in Nagaon district had 45-50 rhinos. While poachers killed a few, the surviving rhinos left for Orang National Park on the north bank of the Brahmaputra following encroachment and human settlements over the last several decades.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Laokhowa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) and the first addition to Burachapori WLS - total 309.20sqkm - has witnessed the return of two rhinos to the landscape after almost a gap of 40 years and they have made the landscape their home since November last year, officials said. While many rhinos were killed, the degradation of grassland habitat amid anthropogenic pressure wiped out the animals from here.
"Happy to share that after 40 years our iconic Rhinos have returned to Laokhowa and Burachapori. They have returned within 1 year of our successful anti-encroachment operation in the region," chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote on X.
