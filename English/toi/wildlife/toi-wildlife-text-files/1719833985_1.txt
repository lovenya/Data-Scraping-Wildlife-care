AHMEDABAD: The Wildlife SOS-GSPCA team, along with the Gujarat forest department, and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Mumbai, recently seized two Bengal eagle-owls from Avdha village in the Valsad district of Gujarat.
The owls were to be sold and used in ritualistic sacrifice during the Kali Chaudas. The Wildlife SOS, operating in collaboration with the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, assisted the forest department.The WCCB Mumbai rescued the eagle-owls while being transported in a car to Avdha village. The owls were kept in a wooden crate. Six persons have been arrested in this connection.
Raj Bhavsar, the project coordinator at Wildlife SOS and president of GSPCA, said, "During Diwali, the owls fall victim to human exploitation, driven by religious myths and superstitious beliefs. The birds are poached for as talons, skulls, bones, feathers, meat and blood, which are then used in talisman, black magic and occult practices. Horned owls such as the Bengal eagle-owl are most sought after as they are coveted for their false feather ear tufts - feather extensions on the head - which are wrongly believed to have mystical properties."
