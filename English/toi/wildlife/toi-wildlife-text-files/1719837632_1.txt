BHOPAL: The State Forest Research Institute (SFRI) has initiated the first ever long-term survey to assess the current ecological status and the distribution of wolves inside the Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary following the reintroduction of tigers during 2018. 
Officials say there are no more than 800 wolves left in MP, making them one of the extremely threatened species.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
“We are funding this project to understand the current status & distribution of Indian wolves in this Sanctuary” said Subharanjan Sen, APCCF (Wildlife), MP Forest. 
Previously, wolves held the position of top carnivore in Nauradehi, making their coexistence with both tigers and humans in this nature reserve, set amidst a human-dominated landscape, a matter of significant interest.

It involves a comprehensive study of wolf behaviour, habitat utilization, prey dynamics, and interactions with both tigers and human activities within the reserve. The two-year-long study seeks to unravel the intricate tapestry of wildlife dynamics. 
Led by Dr Aniruddha Majumdar, a scientist and principal investigator of Wolf Project at the SFRI in Jabalpur, this project holds the promise of uncovering the hidden secrets of the sanctuary’s ecosystem. With the reintroduction of tigers, the delicate balance of nature has shifted, posing new challenges for the inhabitants of Nauradehi. 
Dr Majumdar, who was previously involved in the tiger reintroduction project, is now on a quest to understand how the wolves are faring in the presence of these apex predators and the ever-present human presence. “Our aim is not merely to observe but to truly understand,” Dr Majumdar explains. 
This sanctuary is known for its wolf sightings, yet it remains one of the least studied. That’s precisely why we’re focusing our efforts here, say officials. In addition to ecological surveys, the team is delving into the realm of human perception and psychology, seeking to grasp the attitudes of local communities towards coexisting with wolves. 
Abdul Aleem Ansari, DFO Nauradehi said that they want to bridge the gap between science and society, ensuring that our research reflects the needs and concerns of the people who share their land with these magnificent creatures. The scope of the project is vast, encompassing 72 villages within the sanctuary’s eco-sensitive zone. Every detail matters—the differences in wolf characteristics, the nuances of village perceptions, the intricate web of ecological interactions. 
Officers are diving deep into the heart of ecological separation between large carnivores. Indeed, the expertise of the team is crucial. In Sept 2023, MP govt had officially announced the establishment of the ‘Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve,’ marking the seventh tiger reserve in the state and 54th in the country. 
This newly designated Tiger Reserve encompasses areas within the Nauradehi (Wildlife) & Veerangana Drugavati Sanctuary, recognized for their ecological significance in preserving biodiversity, including flora, fauna, geology, and zoology. It’s home to approximately 15 tigers, making it a vital habitat for the endangered species. 
The combined protected area, formed by notifying Nauradehi and Durgavati Wildlife Sanctuaries, comprises two core areas. Core Area-1 spans an expansive 1390.036 sqkm, while Core Area-2 encompasses 23.97 square kilometres. 
The newly established Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve covers an extensive area of 2,339 sqkm across three districts—Narsinghpur, Sagar, and Damoh. A scientific study conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had identified Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary as a suitable location for the translocation of cheetahs. Union Minister for environment Bhupendra Yadav, had also highlighted Nauradehi as a prospective site for cheetahs in the near future. The relocation of cheetahs to Nauradehi depends on the completion of on-ground preparations.
