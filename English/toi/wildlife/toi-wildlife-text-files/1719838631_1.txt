Raghava Lawrence is all set to star in his 25th film, which will be directed by Venkat Mohan, who previously made the Vishal-starrer Ayogya. “It’s a wildlife action adventure, which will be unlike what Lawrence master has done so far. He wanted to do something that will appeal to all sections of the audience, and given that this has wildlife as an element, which kids love, he liked the script.It sort of involves a relationship between two characters, one of which is an animal,” says Venkat, a former associate of AR Murugadoss.
Going by the poster of the film, it can be assumed that the animal is a tiger. While he’s reluctant to reveal Lawrence’s character in the film, the director informs, “He plays an intense character, which will also have depth. It’s a character that will have minimal dialogues. He will sport two looks in the film.”
A popular Bollywood star is in talks to play the villain. Similarly, a well-known actress from Bollywood will be seen in a key role. The film will go on floors in June.
