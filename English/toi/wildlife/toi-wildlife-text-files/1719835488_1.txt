MUMBAI: Bombay high court quashed criminal cases against the former Dabur Pharma Ltd and an executive for allegedly buying stolen “forest produce” and committing offences under the Indian Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act. 
The HC said the company, now called Fresenius Kabi Oncology Ltd, is engaged in manufacturing pharmaceutical products related to cancer treatment and claimed, with no contrary proof from the Kolhapur forest conservator, to have purchased 22kg of ‘Camptothecin’ for Rs 44 lakh in 2005 without knowing it was extracted from the chips of the stolen Narkya trees.
“it is highly improbable that the company would buy an illegal forest produce for such a huge price, that too at the risk of its prosecution for serious offences,” a division bench of Justices A S Gadkari and Shyam C Chandak said in a December 22 judgment, available on Thursday.
The company and its factory manager at a West Bengal plant, Dr Jayanta Chattopadhyay, had filed the quashing petition in 2011. They along with several other co-accused faced charges under the Wildlife Protection Act, the Indian Forest Act and Indian Penal Code in six different cases filed in Maharashtra. Their counsel, Subhash Jha, argued that Camptothecin is a finished product after being isolated from Narkya trees and not a forest produce as defined under the Forest Act. He said the company or Chattopadhyay are bona fide purchasers of the final product at market price from another company.
Narkya is a small tree, found in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra. Mahalakshmi Ganpathy, the prosecutor, said the Camptothecin seized from the accused was from illegally cut trees stolen from the forests. The HC noted the Supreme Court held that Camptothecin is not a forest produce and hence said prosecution of the company and its executive in criminal cases is “unwarranted”. There is no evidence to show they knew the chips were from stolen trees and hence the cases are quashed, it said.
