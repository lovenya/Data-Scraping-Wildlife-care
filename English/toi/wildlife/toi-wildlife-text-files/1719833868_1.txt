‘Forests are full of fantastic sights’
“All forests are vastly different. From the sightings, wild animals, landscape and biodiversity, every forest area has its own USP.My love for the wild started at Panna National Park where I first spotted a tiger with cubs. It was a terrific feeling. In Kabini, I did eight safaris and managed to capture a tiger through my lens. I also spotted a leopard sitting on top of a tree which was another fantastic sight. Being in a forest, away from the hustle and bustle of urban life, is like therapy.” she says.

‘Wildlife photography is a totally different ball game’
Soon after visiting Panna, Krishi realised her passion for photography and she invested in a camera. “Many people said that spending so much on a camera would not be worth it because I was just a rookie but I was confident that I would be able to pick up the nuances of wildlife photography. Wildlife photography is a totally different ball game but I managed to learn it quickly. It’s what gives me an adrenaline rush now. Photography has helped me give life to my creativity,” she says.
