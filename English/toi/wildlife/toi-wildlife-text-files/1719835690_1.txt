Pilibhit: Dr Amitabh Agnihotri, a recipient of the 2004 state forest and wildlife conservation award and vice president of the Wildlife Biodiversity Conservation Society, has written to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, appealing for the transfer of responsibility for tigers and stray big cats spotted in sugarcane fields from Pilibhit's forest and wildlife division to the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve.
Agnihotri, copying the mail to the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the state environment, forest, and climate change additional chief secretary, emphasised the urgent need for reshuffling due to a lack of trained manpower and wildlife management knowledge in the current division. 
He pointed out the disappearance of 10 tigers found in sugarcane fields in the Amaria area, attributing it to insufficient expertise among officials. Agnihotri noted the presence of leopards, indicating that either the tigers were poached or migrated for unclear reasons.
With over 30% of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) tigers straying into agricultural areas, Agnihotri expressed concern for the safety of over 20 stray tigers under the forest and wildlife divisionâ€™s command. The lack of physical monitoring poses a threat to their well-being, he said. He shared an incident involving a two-year-old tigress rescued by PTR authorities on December 26. Despite straying for months, the forest division failed to locate and rescue her, leading to villagers resorting to violent measures. This highlights the urgency for a change in management to avoid such conflicts.
