Pilibhit: The forest and wildlife team in Pilibhit retrieved the body of a 5-month-old female leopard cub on Friday evening. The carcass, discovered near Piparia Colony on a link road, had severe head injuries, confirming the second hit-and-run incident causing a leopard’s demise in a month.
The autopsy, performed by a panel of three veterinary officers, unveiled multiple fractures in the cub’s skull, causing complete brain damage.Despite the outer head skin remaining intact, the left ear showed signs of trauma, with excessive bleeding from the ear canal.
Concerned about the cub’s survival without its mother’s protection, Anjani Shrivastav, the sub-divisional forest officer, said teams were dispatched to locate the mother leopardess. Simultaneously, there were worries about the cub’s potential accidental separation from its mother, as no pug marks could be traced near the spot.
In a similar incident Jan 1, a 10-month-old female leopard cub met a fatal end in Jar Kalliya village, around 15km from the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) under the Barkhera police station. The autopsy revealed severe brain haemorrhage and a broken lower jaw as the cause of death.
