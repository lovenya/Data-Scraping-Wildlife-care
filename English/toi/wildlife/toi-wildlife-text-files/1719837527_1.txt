The board also sanctioned T-Fiber connectivity to all villages and settlements in forested regions across the state.
Additionally, establishing a conservation reserve linking the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) and Tadoba Tiger Reserve was approved. This conservation zone spans 1,492 sq km in Kagaznagar and Asifabad divisions, facilitating free movement of tigers.
The minister directed the officials to frame rules on use of elephants in special cases. In the wake of rise in bison population in Sathupalli and Kinnerasani areas, discussions were initiated for establishing a dedicated sanctuary for the wild animal and the proposal was approved. 
The minister also addressed the issue of timely payment of salaries to tiger trackers and outsourced employees working in the forest department.
