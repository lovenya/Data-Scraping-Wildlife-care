Keri: Karnataka govt has submitted the Kalasa-Bhandura project proposal to the National Board of Wildlife for necessary clearance.
After obtaining the technical approval from the Central Water Commission, Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd (KNNL) has been making efforts to get clearances from the Union ministry of environment and the wildlife board for the project.
Recently, farmers and religious leaders from the North Karnataka region staged an agitation to exert pressure on the state and central governments to obtain the necessary clearances.
KNNL has submitted a proposal for the use of 10.6 hectares of forest land in the tiger corridor between the Kali and Sahyadri Tiger Reserves for building a diversion weir, a jackwell-cum-pumphouse, an electrical substation, as well as laying a pipeline and a powerline in Kankumbi and other villages for the Kalasa nullah diversion scheme.

Karnataka govt has been striving hard to resume the work of the Kalasa project as farmers and religious leaders from North Karnataka are repeatedly calling for the completion of the damming and diversion schemes at the earliest.
In its proposal, KNNL has given an assurance that the work shall be taken up under the supervision of the forest officers to avoid any damage to the flora and fauna by adhering to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
On March 3, 2023, the chief wildlife warden for the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary had passed an order restraining Karnataka from diverting any water from the Kalasa nullah.
Karnataka filed an interlocutory application before the Supreme Court challenging the order, which is pending adjudication.
