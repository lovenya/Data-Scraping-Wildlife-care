The joint effort led to the confiscation of one leopard skin along with four leopard paws, resulting in the apprehension of seven suspects involved in the illicit trade of wildlife.
In a separate incident, based on intelligence shared by Wildlife SOS-GSPCA, a joint raid was carried out by the Maharashtra Forest Department and WCCB near the Trimbakeshwar temple premises in Nashik, Maharashtra. The traffickers had set up shop near the temple and were trying to sell the contraband. The operation resulted in the seizure of 92 pieces of black coral (Antipatharians) and 34 pieces of hatha jodi (hemipenis of Bengal monitor lizard). Two individuals associated with this case were promptly arrested by the forest department.
Raj Pawar, Range Forest Officer, Nasik, Maharashtra, said, “The accused will face charges under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Further investigations are underway to identify and prosecute any additional individuals involved in the illicit wildlife trade in the region.”
