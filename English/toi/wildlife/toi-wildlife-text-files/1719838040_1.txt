The founder explains, “It’s an amalgamation of ‘kathin samadhan’, which is kati-dhan – solutions for complex problems.”
Ritesh wants to discuss the sales depending on cases. Vineeta says, “Is it in Rayagada? See, I think you will get funding and if you apply this solution in Rayagada, your debt of one year will also be dissolute.” Ritesh laughs.

Anupam tries to understand the business acumen in order to give a deal but doesn’t make an offer. Vineeta and Namita also don’t make an offer.
Ritesh makes an offer. His offer is: Rs 75 lakh for 5% equity + Rs 75 lakh debt at 10% interest for 3 years. He says, “When you need the money, you draw it and then give the interest. If you don’t need the money and you are not withdrawing money, then you don’t need to give interest.”

Seeing the pitcher’s serious face, Ritesh says ‘Thodi toh khushi dikhao dost, aapko lag raha tha deal nahi milega’. Anupam says, “Getting 15X valuation on hardware product, I haven’t seen. It’s a very good offer.” Namita and Vineeta also agree that it’s a good offer.
Ayan accepts the offer.
