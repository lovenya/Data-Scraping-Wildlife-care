DEHRADUN: As many as 444 people in the Himalayan state have lost their lives to human-wildlife conflict since 2017, forest minister Subodh Uniyal said while responding to a starred question in the ongoing assembly session. "The victims were killed in attacks by leopards, tigers, bears, snakes, elephants and crocodiles among others. A total of Rs 21.3 crore has been disbursed to family members of the victims," Uniyal further said.
In response to a query raised by Congress MLA from Haldwani, Sumit Hridayesh, regarding compensation, the forest minister said that, "To provide immediate ex-gratia relief to human-wildlife conflict victims in case of any untoward incident, a Rs 2 crore corpus fund has been formed."
"In addition to increasing the compensation amount for victims, it is for the first time that we have made the provision to give ex-gratia to those attacked by honeybee, hornet, monkey and langur," Uniyal further said.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The Himalayan state has been plagued by a series of animal attacks this year. On Feb 26, Deepa Devi, a resident of Makhet Gaon village, was cutting cattle fodder when a leopard pounced on her in Rudraprayag district. She saved herself by striking the leopard repeatedly with her sickle. A recent leopard attack claimed the life of a nine-year-old child, Riasat Ali, marking the ninth human fatality in less than two months in human-wildlife conflict in the state. He was attacked while he was outside his home in the Madari Van Gujjar Basti in Malsi forest range on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road. 
Around two dozen people have been injured in human-wildlife conflicts this year.
