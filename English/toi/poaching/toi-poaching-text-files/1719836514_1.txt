Panaji: In a rare incident of poaching at the quiet Batim lake, three persons were seen hunting ducks by some locals as they disturbed the peace of flocks of birds in the scenic water body.
The youths, estimated to be in their twenties, left the site on the northern side of the lake, known for its avian biodiversity, with a few dead ducks. “They arrived in a car with guns and fired at the birds,” a villager said.
The site of the hunting is the lake’s remote corner, where massive excavation for mud has triggered landslides in the area.The forest department could not be informed in time, sources said. 
For a few decades, hunting of birds in lakes and wetlands has reduced drastically due to awareness and other factors.

As a birding site, the serene Batim lake draws many birders and enthusiasts during the season for the high number of birds it attracts due to its isolated location. Wedged between a valley around a range of hills and vast paddy fields, a few houses that dot its periphery hardly affect its quiet ambience. 
The water body has been preferred by the bird populations, as some other wetlands like Carambolim lake have been adversely impacted by development in their periphery. 
“The lake may be small but more than 220 species of birds have been observed here, including a lot of migratory ducks like lesser whistling ducks. It is an amazing natural site for students, citizens and others, being also an archaeological site dating back to Kadamba dynasty,” Svabhu Kohli, a birder said.
In recent years, birders have been concerned about the large-scale excavation of mud for road embankments on its northern side, as the run-offs may impact its water quality.
