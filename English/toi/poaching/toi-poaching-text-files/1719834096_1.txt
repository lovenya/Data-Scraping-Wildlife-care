DEHRADUN: With barely days left for declaration of state assembly results, the state Congress is mulling to shift its candidates to ‘safe houses’ in party-ruled Rajasthan to ensure that “winning candidates are not poached by BJP at the last minute in the event of a hung assembly.”
A senior Congress leader, requesting anonymity, said, “The party is definitely on alert mode as the results declaration date is nearing.And given the horse-trading histo- ry of BJP, we won’t give them any chance this time. Certain plans are already on the table, including sending Congress candidates to Rajasthan.”
The leader said Congress state leadership has given ‘sp- ecific directions’ to all candidates. “We got our fingers burnt earlier due to BJP’s horse trading in 2016. We are prepared this time. The state leadership, including former CM and party national general secretary Harish Rawat, party state president Ganesh Godiyal and leader of opposition Pritam Singh, will meet Congress central leadership on Sunday and return on Monday,” he said.
Godiyal avoided commenting on the Rajasthan plan and said, “We have full faith inour candidates. ” As for the ‘threat’ posed by BJP, he said, “All our members have been alerted. This time, we won’t give BJP a chance to play foul tricks.”
Uttarakhand BJP leaders, meanwhile, dismissed Congress’s allegations. Manveer Singh Chauhan, party state media in-charge, said, “The whole state saw the sting operation on Harish Rawat back when he was the CM in 2017. It doesn’t befit Congress to accuse us of indulging in horse trading.”
