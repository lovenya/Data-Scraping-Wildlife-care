The team seized a leopard skin, four chopped paws, canines, teeth, and whiskers. Three motorcycles used to traffic the materials were also seized.
The accused have been identified as Radheshyam Uikey, Jallatola, Jogeshwar Daseriya, Dhansowa (Bori), Pappu Madavi, Jambhli, Dinesh Shrivastav, Bhandara, Sandeep Ramteke, Mokara, Dinesh Sahare, Deori, Vinod Daseriya, Kawrabandh, Litesh Kumbhre, Baghnadi (Chhattisgarh), Parasram Meshram, Girola, and Ramkrishna Dahale, Pandhri.

But, the animal was poached and later its body parts were removed. For the past four months, the accused were looking for prospective customers. 
On November 24, a team of Nagpur forest officials had nabbed five persons for poaching a tiger and had seized its body parts. In both these cases, Melghat Cyber Cell proved to be of big help in tracking the culprits.
