DALTONGANJ: Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) authorities prevented a poaching attempt earlier this week by arresting two poachers along with country-made guns from Chipadohar east range. 
Last week, two poachers were held with a severed head of a deer from PTR. On the recent breakthrough, officials said they swung into action as soon as they got information that five persons had entered the reserve area with weapons to kill (poach) animals.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“Three others managed to escape but we are tracking them,” said, Kumar Ashish, deputy director of PTR’s north division.
