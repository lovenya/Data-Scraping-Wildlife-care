HYDERABAD: Accusing BJP of trying to stall probe into the poachgate involving four TRS MLAs, ministers T Harish Rao and S Niranjan Reddy said the saffron party was scared of an investigation as it would unravel their role in the murky episode and hence approached the court.
“On one hand, BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and others claim that the three accused who were caught red-handed while trying to lure our MLAs to defect into the saffron party have no links with BJP.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoOn the other, saffron party general secretary G Premender Reddy is approaching various courts to stop the investigation and has even filed a case against the SIT,” Harish Rao said on Thursday.
He said the BJP state chief even took a pledge in Yadadri temple saying that the accused had no connection with the party. “The party, instead of seeking fast-tracking of the investigation in a transparent manner, is demanding that the case be handed over to the CBI,” Rao said, adding that SIT was constituted by the state to fast-track the probe. “BJP is in power in 17-18 states. All the cases are being transferred to CBI in those states. It appears the BJP leaders do not have faith in Telangana police. Is it wrong to catch hold of accused in the poaching case,” Rao sought to know. 
The minister said they have faith in police & courts. On the governor’s allegation that her phone was being tapped, the minister said the whole country knows whose phones were being tapped by whom.
