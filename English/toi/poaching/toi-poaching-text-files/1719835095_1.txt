Margao: Congress working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco on Tuesday alleged that Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) agenda was to strengthen BJP across India. 
“The TMC has already poached several Congress persons. It has focused on Congress constituencies, including in Salcete taluka and South Goa rather than targeting BJP,” he said
TMC has neither targeted nor attempted to target any active BJP party leaders or BJP constituencies and its agenda is to strengthen BJP across India, Lourenco alleged, questioning why only Congress members are being poached.
He challenged TMC to tell the people of Goa about the names of BJP functionaries who have joined the party. Lourenco said that it was “shocking” that TMC didn’t walk out along with opposition members from the Lok Sabha on December 6 as they were not happy with the statement of Union home minister Amit Shah concerning the gruesome killing of 13 civilians in Nagaland in an army ambush on December 4.
