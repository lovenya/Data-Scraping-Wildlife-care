Incidents of Lankan Navy personnel firing at Indian fishermen and seizing their boats in the Palk Strait are not uncommon.
The Palk Strait, separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, serves as a prime fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. However, inadvertent trespassing frequently leads to arrests on both sides.
In 2023 alone, the Sri Lankan Navy arrested 240 Indian fishermen and seized 35 trawlers for alleged poaching in Sri Lankan waters. The recurring incidents underscore the ongoing challenges in managing fishing activities and territorial disputes between the two neighboring nations.
