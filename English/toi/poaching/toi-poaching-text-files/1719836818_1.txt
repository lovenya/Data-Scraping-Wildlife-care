Panaji: There is no documented census methodology for counting frogs in Goa even though the frog population is on the decline. It is only during sample surveys and extrapolation of wildlife population that the species is documented in the state.
“Isolated studies done in 2011-12 revealed a decline in the population due to frog meat consumption. However, there is no official frog survey or documented methodology for census,” said South Goa deputy conservator of forests, Prem Kumar on the eve of ‘Save the Frogs day’
Goa has recorded a total of 24 species of frogs so far, two of which have been named in honour of forest range forest officers owing to their conservation efforts.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe amphibians annually face the threat of poaching.
