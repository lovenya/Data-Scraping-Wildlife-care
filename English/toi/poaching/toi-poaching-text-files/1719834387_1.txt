GUWAHATI: The removal of encroachments in contiguous areas and adding those to the forest, round the clock vigilance by forest guards in poaching-prone zones and strict monitoring of the guards are some of the reasons that only one rhino was killed last year in the Kaziranga National Park (KNP), the lowest in 21 years. 
Park director P Sivakumar told TOI, “Different strategies, including making a few forest areas like Bandardubi in Nagaon encroachment-free and adding those to the park have helped in reducing poaching in the park.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoSuspected poachers used to take shelter in these areas. Therefore, evicting them was a major crackdown.”
He further said round the clock strict vigilance by the Anti-Poaching Task Force (APTF), formed last year to patrol mainly poaching-prone zones, has successfully prevented entry of poachers into the park. He said the Agaratoli and Burhapahar ranges were the two zones with major poaching cases and not a single poaching was reported in Burhapahar. The lone poaching case was reported in the Agaratoli range last year.
He, however, said that 300 out of 1,900 forest guard posts are vacant in the park. “Recruitment for these posts will be done soon. This will strengthen the security more,” he added.

The years 2013 and 2014 recorded highest rhino poaching in the park in the last 21 years. A total of 54 rhinos were poached during these two years. However, the trend gradually decreased.
