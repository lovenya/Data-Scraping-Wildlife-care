Cuttack: In an apparent bid to find a solution to the problem of elephant deaths in the state, the Orissa high court on Tuesday decided to take out of the courtroom adjudication of four PILs on the issue to a conference room to assess the ground situation regarding implementation of the Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) on elephants.
The HC asked all members of the Joint Task Force (JTF) looking into cases of poaching of elephants, counsels of thepetitioners and intervenors in the cases to gather for an interaction after court hours from 4.30 pm on September 11.
The two-judge bench of Chief Justice Subhasis Talapatra and Justice Savitri Ratho requested chief conservator of forests Manoj V Nair, who is also the JTF convener, to initiate the conversation and streamline the interface to find a solution. The bench expected Nair to make a detailed presentation on the CAP and give an update on its implementation, especially regarding tackling the elephant deaths due to poaching, electrocution and train hits.
