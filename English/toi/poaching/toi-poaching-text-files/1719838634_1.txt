Raipur: Describing frequent change of loyalty by the elected representatives as a “menace for the society”, senior advocate Syed Iqbal Ahmed Rizvi from Chhattisgarh has written to the Election Commission of India (ECI) with a copy to the President of India Draupadi Murmu and the Prime Minister Narender Modi for corrective measures to keep a tab on such practices.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Advocate Rizvi, 75, said in the letter, “The mass exodus by the elected representatives has affected public interest. This ultimately cost heavily on the exchequer.”
The power to recall such elected representatives is yet to be included in the law, he said while expressing his concern over the apathy on the part of the government in implementing it.
He wrote that such representatives should resign and the person, who secured the second highest votes should be declared elected representative. “Dalbadlu leaders should be barred from contesting any election for six years in future,” he said.TNN
