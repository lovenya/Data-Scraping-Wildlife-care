MUMBAI: Congress is irked over the way the Sharad Pawar-led NCP allegedly engineered defection in the Congress-controlled Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC). All 27 councillors, led by mayor Tahera Shaikh and former legislator Rashid Shaikh, joined the NCP in presence of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state party president Jayant Patil. 
Expressing displeasure over the "large-scale poachi-ng", state Congress chief Nana Patole said: "Even if it is Maha Vikas Aghadi, it involves politics.If they [councillors] are joining NCP on their own, there is no point in communicating displeasure to them. If NCP is engineering defection, we will have to take a call in the future...in days to come, NCP councillors will join the Congress..." 
In the MMC House of 84, Congress had a strength of 29-two members passed away recently-NC, Shiv Sena 13, BJP 9, MIM 7 and Janata Dal 6. 
Welcoming the councillors, Patil said their entry will strengthen NCP at the grassroots level and help the party in the state legislative assembly polls. "Once the pandemic subsides, we propose to hold a rally in Malegaon in Pawar's presence," he added. Ajit Pawar said it is now NCP's commitment for the overall development of the Malegaon-Nashik belt in a time-bound period. "We will work out a comprehensive action plan and allot more funds for Malegaon's development," he said. Minority development minister Nawab Malik too assured that the MVA is committed for minorities' welfare.
