Chandrapur: A female tiger was found dead in the fields of Chalbardi village under Bhadrawati forest range on Monday morning. Postmortem findings have concluded that the tigress was poached with an electrified wire.
This is the first case of tiger death this year. Foresters have registered a criminal case and have begun investigation.
The matter came light after a villager found a carcass lying along the farm trail on Chalbardi-Konda road.Upon learning about it, a team led by range forest officer (RFO) Bhadrawati range Haridas Shende rushed to the spot.
Investigation revealed that the tigress, aged around three years, was poached with the help of electrified wire. It is likely that the tigress was killed by the electrified wire laid in the farm to thwart the herbivores intruding fields. But the carcass was removed from the spot of poaching and thrown on the farm trail. All the valuable body parts of the tigress were intact.
