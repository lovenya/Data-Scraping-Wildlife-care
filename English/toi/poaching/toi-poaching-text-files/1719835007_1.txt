RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday alleged that the BJP was roaming around with money bags to buy legislators and also using Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax to pressurize the MLAs to switch sides to topple the government in Jharkhand. 
Baghel was referring to the criticism by BJP leaders against his government for “hosting” Jharkhand MLAs in the state capital. PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Speaking to reporters in Raipur, Baghel said, “Despite being in government, the fear of Jharkhand MLAs is that BJP is roaming with bags of money to poach the legislators besides, they are also being pressurized through ED and IT. MLAs are not fond of leaving all their work and sit in Chhattisgarh.”
Replying to a question on BJP national vice-president Raman Singh’s criticizing state government for “giving refuge” to Jharkhand MLAs, Baghel said, “Why didn’t he question when his party was poaching and horse trading legislators of other parties by resorting to threats, lure, and other means? It had been going on, but now when we are supporting a party that’s in alliance with Congress and bringing the MLAs here, what’s the problem? They have disrobed democracy and trying to defame and terrorize Congress because they can’t tolerate government of opposition parties.”

When Prime Minister is praising works of Chhattisgarh, these (BJP in state) people are criticizing,” CM said.
CM also questioned why wasn’t the letter sent to Jharkhand Raj Bhavan not opened yet, “It should be first be clarify if they have received the letter and then answer why don’t they open it. Does it mean they want to horse trade and are waiting to crack a deal before the letter is opened?”
About 32 MLAs of JMM-Congress-RJD coalition from Jharkhand reached Raipur on Tuesday to prevent the BJP from “attempting to poach its legislators”. They travelled in three passenger buses and are camping at a luxurious resort in Nava Raipur. There are 15 MLAs from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and 17 from Congress.
