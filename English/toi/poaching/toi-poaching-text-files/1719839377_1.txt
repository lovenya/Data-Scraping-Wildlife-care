HYDERABAD: Paving the way for the entry of CBI into the poaching of Telangana MLAs case, the high court on Monday dismissed an appeal by the state government that was seeking the continuation of the probe by the state police led special investigation team (SIT). 
The bench of chief justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice N Tukaramji also refused to stay the operation of its judgment when a request was made by advocate general BS Prasad to enable the state to challenge this order in the Supreme Court.It may be recalled that the Poachgate scandal broke after cops arrested three persons — Ramachandra Bharathi, Nanda Kumar and Simhayaji — from BRS MLA Rohith Reddy’s farmhouse in a sting operation in October 2022 for allegedly trying to lure four BRS (then TRS) MLAs to join BJP with promises of hundreds of crores in cash and big contracts. 
The state police laid a trap and caught the three accused red-handed while they were making huge oral offers though no cash was seized from the spot. The state formed a special investigation team to inquire into the issue.
 Following complaints from the accused that the state and its police were moving in a predetermined manner in the matter, a single judge earlier entrusted the probe to the CBI. Aggrieved by this, the state filed an appeal before a division bench of the high court.

There cannot be any intra court appeal in criminal matters. The appellate authority is the apex court, the bench said while dismissing the state plea. State will now move the Supreme Court against this order.
