Nagpur: A case of alleged leopard poaching with the knowledge of forest officials in Akola division came to fore on Thursday. The leopard was killed on April 23, 2022, but the pictures of the buried leopard went viral on Wednesday.
Akola deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Arjuna KR said, “We received pictures of leopard skin and videos, and calls from local activists that a leopard carcass has been buried by a forest guard in Sawargaon beat under Alegaon forest range.”
“The matter was kept under wraps and it suddenly came out now.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWe immediately visited the spot and started an inquiry. Parts of the decomposed carcass of the leopard were collected and have been sent for forensic tests. Strict action will be taken against those involved in the poaching of the leopard,” said Arjuna.
Alegaon RFO Vishwanath Chavan said, “As we did not know about the death, no Preliminary Offence Report (POR) was registered against the accused. It is also possible that the leopard was quietly buried by the locals and they are putting the blame on foresters. As of now the role of forest staff has not been ascertained.”

Wildlife activist Sheikh Munna Sheikh, president of Sarpamitra Nisarga Savwardhan Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha, Akola, said, “The role of foresters cannot be ruled out as the picture of the dry leopard skin has GPS locations and April 23, 2022, as the date of the incident. No one other than foresters can take such a photograph of the crime scene. The forest staff must have hushed up the matter to save their skin. It is surprising how forest staff claim they learned about the case after five long months.”
When the matter came to light, high drama was witnessed with local journalist Gopal Rathod and villagers reaching the spot to expose the foresters. There was also a wordy duel between them when foresters warned them against trespassing.
