Haridwar: To prevent poaching and protect wildlife, forest guards will conduct patrolling on bikes in Uttarakhand.
In order to preserve biological diversity under the 'Project Hero Green Drive', Hero MotoCorp handed over 300 motorcycles to the Himalayan eco restoration, biodiversity conservation and livelihood enhancement society in Rishikesh.
These motorcycles will enable the forest guards and rangers to conduct effective active patrols in the forest, thereby increasing their mobility to keep a check on poaching and illegal deforestation, forest fires, and protection of trees/forest and wild animals, officials said.
The motorcycles were handed over to minister Subodh Uniyal and other dignitaries in the presence of senior government officials and executives from the company.
