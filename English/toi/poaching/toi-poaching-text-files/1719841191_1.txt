OpenAI, the startup behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, is reportedly making moves to enter the search market by poaching employees from Google, according to a report from Bloomberg.
Sources familiar with the matter revealed that OpenAI is secretly developing a search platform that would directly compete with Google Search and Microsoft's Bing. The new feature would be integrated into ChatGPT, allowing users to ask questions and receive answers with cited sources and, in some cases, images alongside the text results for added context.
Bloomberg's report suggests that OpenAI is actively recruiting Google employees who work on the company's search team to bolster its efforts in building this new search platform.The Verge, citing a separate source, also reported on OpenAI's attempts to lure Google employees to its search project, although the exact number of employees who have been successfully recruited remains unknown.
The development of an AI-powered search platform is no easy feat, but OpenAI's vast repository of data, exceptional compute power, and large language models (LLMs) give it a unique advantage in potentially creating one. With millions of users already relying on ChatGPT for answers to their questions, the addition of a search feature seems like a natural progression for the startup.
Google, which has dominated the search market for decades, is well aware of the potential threat posed by OpenAI and other AI-powered search startups like Perplexity. In response, Google search boss Prabhakar Raghavan has urged his team to be more agile and adapt to the changing market reality, acknowledging that the company must move faster to stay ahead of the competition.
As of now, there is no official timeline for when OpenAI plans to launch its search service. However, if the reports are accurate, the startup's announcement could potentially coincide with Google's upcoming I/O developer conference.
