NEW DLHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to grant interim bail to accused in the MLA-poaching case in Telangana, who were purportedly caught on camera offering money to some legislators, and asked them to approach the high court for regular bail.
 A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Vikram Nath also quashed the order passed by a division bench of the Telangana HC ordering that the probe in the case be done by a stategovernment appointed SIT under the supervision of an HC judge who was hearing the case.The bench said the petition filed by the accused seeking transfer of the probe to the CBI was pending before the single-judge bench and it should be first decided. Meanwhile, the probe in the case will be done by the SIT.
