NAGPUR: After five deaths in January, the official tiger toll in Maharashtra reached seven this year as two tiger cubs have been found dead in the last two days in Sukanegaon under the Wani forest range in Yavatmal district. 
Prima facie, veterinarians performing the post-mortem said, the cubs died due to starvation after the mother went missing. "The cubs were around three months old.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoA tigress is a caring mother and never leaves such young cubs alone, except when she is out on a hunt. The tigress is feared poached, " said sources.
Some villagers told TOI that after sighting the cubs separately while moving sluggishly in the forest patch, they informed the forest department "so that the cubs could be rescued".
According to Kiran Jagtap, deputy conservator of forest (DyCF), Pandharkawada, the villagers found the cubs dead near a water body, "the first one on Wednesday and another on Thursday".

Four teams have been formed to track the tigress. "We saw pug marks but they were too old. The tigress was a transient animal and must have come from other forest areas that connect Maregaon and Mukutban ranges," said Jagtap.
