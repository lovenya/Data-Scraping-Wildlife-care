Nagpur: Following clues from the Assam tiger skin seizure case, Maharashtra forest officials nabbed 11 members, including five women, of organized gangs of tiger poachers hailing from Haryana in a swoop on a camp at Ambe Shivni, 15km from Gadchiroli, at 2am on Sunday.
The teams seized seven steel jaw traps, weapons used to kill tigers, three tiger claws, ₹46,000 in cash, cell phones, and other incriminating material.The gang members were selling cloth bags, and staying in the area for the last one year, with forest officials clueless.

It was only after a tiger skin seizure in Assam on June 28 that the poaching racket came to light. The skin was from the forest on the Gadchiroli-Chandrapur border. Investigators fear that at least 8-10 tigers must have been poached by these ‘Kalla’ and ‘Rumali’ gangs. 
The arrests may be the biggest action against tiger poachers since 2013, when 60-70 poachers of Baheliya gangs from Katni in Madhya Pradesh were arrested for killing at least 30 tigers from Vidarbha forests in 2012-13.
