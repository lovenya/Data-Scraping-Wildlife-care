AHMEDABAD: The Indian Coast Guard will be roped in as wildlife wardens to curb poaching of dolphins along the Gujarat coast, said the state government in the state assembly on Tuesday. 
The Indian Coast Guard, Marine police and customs will team up and conduct regular patrolling in the coastal waters, the state government added.
According to the Gujarat forest department, there are about 200 dolphins in the Marine National Park and the dolphin tourism zone.
During a debate on the dolphin poaching incident in Gujarat waters, the government said that a high-level meeting with the coast guards was held to make them aware of the conservation of whale sharks and dolphins.

Forest minister Mulubhai Bera replied that to create a robust information network and get tip-offs, the department will strengthen its ties with local fishermen and ensure that such activities are not reported in the Gujarat waters.
Bera added that 10 fishermen - five from Tamil Nadu, two each from Kerala and Assam and one from Odisha - were held on March 15 off the coast of Porbandar, and the carcasses of 22 dolphins and four bull sharks were seized from their boat.
Defending the Gujarat fishing community, he said fishermen here avoid catching dolphins and other protected marine species. "Even if these species are caught in the nets, the fishermen cut the nets and release them back into the water," said Bera.
