HYDERABAD: Stating that this is the third tiger which disappeared under suspicious circumstances in Telangana’s Eturnagaram wildlife sanctuary before it became a victim of poaching, wildlife conservationists questioned the measures taken by the forest department officials to protect the forest as well as the tigers in the state.
The wildlife conservationists working extensively in the tiger corridors, wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves of Telangana attributed the increasing risk of poaching to the forest department’s decision to hide information about the big cats, especially after the death of two tigers that happened in 2018 and 2019.
“This decision of the forest department to hide the information about tiger population is further endangering their existence in Telangana. When you hide the information, there won’t be any transparency, there won’t be any checking, and nobody will follow-up,” said SK Sandeep Reddy Poncharam, a wildlife conservationists and tribal educator, who has been working in the region since 2005.
In Eturnagaram, Reddy said that the developmental activities and commercialization of the forest areas, especially to benefit the non-tribals who come to witness the Sammakka Sarakka jatara every year are also among the reasons behind the shrinking of forest area and increase in poaching activities.

As per the All-India Tiger Estimation 2018, there are 26 tigers in Telangana.
