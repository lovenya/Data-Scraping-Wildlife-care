NEW DELHI: AAP MLA Raghav Chadha on Sunday alleged that BJP was trying to “lure” its legislators and other functionaries in Punjab ahead of the assembly elections in the state.
“The senior-most leaders of BJP are now sitting at their homes in Delhi and calling up Members of Parliament, MLAs and even sportspersons from the Aam Aadmi Party, begging them to join BJP,” Chadha alleged in a press conference on Sunday.
 “They are trying to lure the people of the Aam Aadmi Party with large amounts of money and power, promising ‘any sum of money and any position that you desire if you leave AAP and join BJP’,” he alleged, adding that state unit president Bhagwant Mann had been receiving such phone calls too.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
