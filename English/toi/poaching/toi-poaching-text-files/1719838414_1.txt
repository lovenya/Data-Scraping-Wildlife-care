Their efforts zeroed in on three individuals: Diwashu Singh Baghel, Sujit Baiga, and Chokhelal Panika, all residents of Madudol. Regrettably, during the operation, Chokhelal Panika managed to evade capture, while Diwashu Singh Baghel and Sujit Baiga were successfully apprehended.
During subsequent interrogations, both detained individuals confessed to their involvement in the hunting of the tiger. They admitted to using two Bharmar guns (muzzle loading firearms) to execute the heinous act and extracting the canines, claws, and whiskers from the tiger's carcass. Acting on the information provided by Diwashu Singh Baghel, authorities were able to recover one piece of the tiger's canine, along with a loaded gun, from the scene of the crime.
Divanshu Baghel, one of the arrested suspects, disclosed that the fugitive, Chokhelal Panika, is currently in possession of two tiger claws, one loaded gun, and four to five strands of whiskers. Efforts are being made to locate and apprehend Chokhelal Panika.
The incident has sent shockwaves through the conservation community, particularly at the renowned Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, which has gained global recognition for its tireless efforts in tiger conservation.
"This corridor connects the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve and the Sanjay Dubri Tiger Reserve, encompassing the Godawal range under the North Shahdol Vyahari Division. It serves as a crucial habitat for tigers and various other wild animals, with notable wildlife activity occurring in the surrounding villages. The region is home to an estimated population of 10 to 12 tigers, but unfortunately, it has a history of attracting hunters. Hence, it is imperative to maintain constant vigilance to ensure their protection. Efforts must be made to prevent any further hunting incidents, as such activities have occurred in the past, posing a threat to the tiger population", says Pusphendra Dwivedi, Honorary Wildlife Warden, Umeria
