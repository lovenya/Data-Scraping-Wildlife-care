Chennai: Expressing dismay over lack of in-depth probe into a tiger poaching case reported in the Nilgiris, Madras high court has directed the investigation officer to appear in the court with all relevant documents on July 5. The department should go to the bottom of the poaching racket and trace the end-receivers of tiger hides, teeth and nails, said a special bench of Justice N Sathish Kumar and Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy on Friday.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoIt then asked the Tamil Nadu forest department to crack down on the entire racket behind tiger poaching in the reserve forests of the state.
When a batch of PILs seeking to check tiger and elephant poaching in Tamil Nadu came up for hearing on Friday, the forest department submitted that six people from northern India were arrested for poaching in Sathyamangalam. A chargesheet would be filed soon.
By a separate order, the bench rejected a separate plea seeking to relocate the elephant Arikomban from Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR) to Mathikettan Shola National Park. The court refused to entertain the plea based on the submission of the forest department that the elephant is recouping well in the present location.
“The forest area supports different vegetation types such as Shola grassland, bamboo, reed brakes and swamps favourable for elephants. As there is adequate water in Kuttiyar and Kodaiyar reservoirs along with salubrious weather conditions, Arikomban is comfortable in his new home,” the department said. Recording the submissions, the bench disposed of a PIL moved by Rebecca Joseph of Kerala seeking relocation of the elephant.
