HYDERABAD: While the hotline is abuzz with top dissidents in BRS, both Congress and BJP are not poaching big-ticket leaders now. Joinings are on hold till the poll horizon clears in Karnataka. The saffron party, however, hasn’t slammed brakes on grassroot recruitments, where cadre is being wooed, not ticket aspirants.
Insiders say political leaders and professionals who wish to shift gears will take a call after Karnataka poll results and election notification in Telangana.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Ticket allotments by BRS will also play a major role, when rebels in the pink party will be looking out for greener pastures. BJP, however, is currently focusing on grassroot joinings. “Every day, cadres are being inducted at the booth-level and this is key to establishing the party. We are doing well,” said a party leader.
In fact, BJP has taken thestand that whoever joins the party will have to align with its ideology and work hard. ‘We don’t differentiate between old and new, but only consider hard work and winnability. This formula is in force for ex-MLAs and other leaders,” a top leader said.

Konda Visheswar Reddy, Eatala Rajender and a few others weighed their options after quitting BRS and finally joined BJP. This trend will continue. We are not under stress, many will join before elections,” said a top leader.
Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy and J Krishna Rao who were suspended from BRS are still making up their mind.
“Apart from local conditions, they may look at Karnataka elections too before choosing BJP or Congress,” said sources.
