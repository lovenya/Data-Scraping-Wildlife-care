MUMBAI: Even as the Congress has said that it will fight the upcoming BMC polls alone, the party is now seeking a ‘no-poaching’ pact among the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners, Shiv Sena and NCP, to prevent a possible party hopping by corporators and aspiring candidates. 
The Congress has said that in a bid to prevent poaching, an understanding must be reached between MVA partners, Shiv Sena in particular, before the BMC polls so that Congress corporators don’t jump over to the Sena and vice versa.
“Even though the Congress has said that we will go it alone in the BMC polls, the issue of a no-poaching pact will be discussed within the MVA leaders for the BMC polls.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThis will ensure that there is no displeasure and discontent among the MVA partners even if the BMC polls are being fought alone,” said Charan Singh Sapra, working president of the Mumbai Congress. 
While Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap has maintained that he is not in favour of an alliance with the Sena for the BMC elections, Sena strategists have said that instead of a formal alliance, the party may have an ‘understanding’ with the Congress in key areas to defeat the BJP. Political analysts said that with the redrawing of ward boundaries, there would be large-scale poaching with several corporators and aspiring candidates jumping parties to get tickets. “In this scenario, a no-poaching pact will help the MVA against the BJP. This will also help them in case they form an alliance after the elections in the BMC,” said an analyst. 
A senior Sena functionary said that it would be difficult to adjust the Congress in an alliance since the Sena has for decades contested over 150 seats in the 227-member BMC. “The Congress will not concede fewer than 80-100 seats,” the functionary said.
