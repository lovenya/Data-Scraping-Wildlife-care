DALTONGANJ: Forest officials in Latehar on Friday said they arrested three men for allegedly hunting a deer inside the Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) and skinning its hide for meat. 
PTR (north division) deputy director Kumar Ashish said the poachers were identified as Ravinder Bhuiyan, Sitaram Bhuiyan and Ghanshyam Singh. The trio are residents of Garee village, located 10 kilometres from the Betla National Park.
