NEW DELHI: Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia produced an audio clip of an alleged BJP member purportedly discussing the party's attempt to poach AAP MLAs in the capital. 
He then demanded arrest of Union home minister Amit Shah, if he was involved in the attempt to lure MLAs.
At a press conference, the senior AAP leader played the audio clip and identified the BJP "dalal" (broker) as one of the three people detained in Telangana for allegedly trying to oust the state's ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi MLAs.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
There was no immediate reaction from the BJP or Shah. 
 "In this audio, the BJP's dalal (broker) can be heard luring a (TRS) MLA to the BJP, saying they were also trying to poach 43 Delhi MLAs and that money had been kept aside for this purpose. He is also saying that he has spoken with Shah and BL Santosh," Sisodia said. 
 "If it is Home Minister Amit Shah the BJP's dalal is referring to, he should immediately be arrested and questioned," the Delhi deputy chief minister demanded. 
 He said the audio tape was a "proof" of the BJP's failed attempt to poach AAP MLAs in Delhi and Punjab and demanded a probe by the Enforcement Directorate into the matter. 
 "It is very dangerous for a country if its home minister is involved in such a conspiracy," Sisodia said.
