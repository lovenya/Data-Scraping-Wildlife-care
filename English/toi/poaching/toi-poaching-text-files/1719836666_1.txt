THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Thushar Vellappally, who heads the BDJS, a BJP ally in the state, on Friday rubbished claims of Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao that he was behind the sensational MLAs' poaching case.
"I have not contacted any MLAs and I have had no role in this. If they claim to have evidence, let them bring it. Whatever has come out there is nothing to prove my involvement," Thushar, who is presently out of the state, informed the media.
According to the Telangana CM, one of the three arrested persons, alleged to be the agents of the BJP, spoke to Thushar and he also released a photograph of Thushar with home minister Amit Shah.
Rao alleged that the agents were arrested in Hyderabad while trying to buy four MLAs of Telangana Rashtra Samiti by offering huge money.
