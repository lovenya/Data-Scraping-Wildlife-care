Range Officer Mailani Anil Kumar said, "We seized a net and an axe from the spot and the accused said he had set up the trap to capture a wild boar. Such nets are dangerous as there have been instances of big cats getting trapped in them and dying. Weâ€™re searching for others involved in poaching."
