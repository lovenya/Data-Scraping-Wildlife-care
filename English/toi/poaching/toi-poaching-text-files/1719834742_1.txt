There is a strong possibility that Congress and BJP will take their MLAs for political fencing to Udaipur and Jaipur to avoid poaching and horse trading amid high profile contest for the fourth seat of Rajya Sabha polls in Rajasthan. The fight became interesting after the entry of Subhash Chandra as independent pro-BJP candidate, who is pitted against Congressâ€™ Pramod Tiwari.
As per official sources, both parties have started making preparations for political fencing with their MLAs.
While Congress shall take its MLAs to Udaipur from June 3 onwards after the conclusion of its two-day workshop (on June 1 and 2), BJP shall hold its MLAs meeting on June 5 and will thereafter take its MLAs to a Jaipur hotel for political camping.
Congress MLAs will be taken to Udaipur in the same hotel where Chintan Shivir was organised a few days back, said sources.
CM Ashok Gehlot said that MLAs are taken to camps because they themselves say that attempts are made to lure them. He said, whether it is the Congress or the BJP, it is important to keep the MLAs together.
