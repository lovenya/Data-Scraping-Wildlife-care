Ozariya in his statement said that he had caught the animal from Dodhla river near Amdha village and was about to sell it. “The accused had committed cruelty to wild animals for their own benefit. The accused had come to purchase the wild animal for use in some black magic ritual. In this modern age, people like these commit a crime for their own purpose. Also, the victim (animal) is unable to come to seek justice. The accused had attempted to rob the natural resources and therefore such crimes need to be brought under control,” JMFC Dileep Savaliya, observed in his judgment.
