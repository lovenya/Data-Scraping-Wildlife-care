HYDERABAD: A battle to protect intellectual property and business turf is playing out in a United States court between Hyderabad-based software testing companies - Cigniti Technologies and newly set up QualiZeal, which formally opened its global development centre in Hyderabad in May this year.
The 1240 crore turnover Cigniti has got an interim injunction restraining QualiZeal from soliciting or accepting business from entities that were its clients or prospective clients between October 1, 2020, and November 30, 2021.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The Dallas County District Court has also ordered QualiZeal, which employs several former top-rung Cigniti employees, to return all confidential data, proprietary information, trade secrets belonging to Cigniti.
Cigniti filed a lawsuit on November 24, 2021 against former employees Pradeep Govindasamy, Kalyana Rao Konda and Doug Hall as well as QualiZeal seeking a temporary restraining order but as the court felt there was enough evidence, it engaged a forensic expert, EY, to compile evidence.

In its order, the US court said Cigniti would suffer imminent and irreparable harm unless QualiZeal, Govindasamy and Konda were enjoined because they had been using Cigniti's confidential information and trade secrets for their benefit and to Cigniti's detriment. 
The court observed that Govindasamy and Konda, who were presidents at Cigniti till October 19, 2021, and November 10, 2021, respectively, "enjoyed access to Cigniti's confidential information including client lists, employee lists, methodologies and trade secrets". With the help of forensic experts from EY, Cigniti was able to recover data from Govindasamy's office laptop which showed that as early as February 2021 he was involved in the creation of the competitor company QualiZeal.
"Cigniti's forensic experts from EY determined that certain of those documents were created by Govindasamy and modified by Konda," the order read. Court also ordered QualiZeal to return confidential Cigniti data, trade secrets.
