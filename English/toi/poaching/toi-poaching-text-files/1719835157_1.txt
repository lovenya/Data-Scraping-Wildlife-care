HYDERABAD: Karnataka former advocate general and senior counsel Udaya Holla on Wednesday said the TRS government has no moral right to talk about democratic values in public life. 
"It bought 23 MLAs who were elected from other political parties in 2014. It purchased as many as 10 Congress MLAs in 2018. Even in the Poachgate FIR, out of the four MLAs who are being shown as complainants, three MLAs had crossed floor from Congress to TRS," Udaya Holla said.
He was arguing the case of Bhusarapu Srinivas, an advocate from Karimnagar, who was arraigned as an accused by the special investigation team in the Poachgate FIR. Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, who heard the case, adjourned the case to Friday for further hearing.
"When you point out one finger towards others, four fingers will be pointing towards you," Uday Holla said. The ongoing probe by SIT has no credibility because it is being headed by Hyderabad police commissioner who himself is facing allegations of phone tapping from none other than the state governor, he said.

"The same treatment was on display when 30 policemen came to advocate Srinivas's residence and pasted 41-A notice on his door. The way it was released to media, all this shows the scant regard he has for law. Hence, SIT lacks credibility," he said, seeking transfer of the ongoing probe to CBI.
