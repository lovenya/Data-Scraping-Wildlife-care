Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to go to Delhi in the next couple of days to raise the alleged poaching of TRS MLAs a big issue at the national level. 
KCR reportedly is collecting all the audio recordings between the accused trio and TRS MLAs. The TRS leaders claim that even some top leaders in Delhi spoke to the accused over the phone.“If need be, the TRS will mobilise the support of other non-BJP parties as they will also be targeted in future by the BJP,” a senior TRS leader said.
