NEW DELHI: Election Commission (EC) on Friday asked Delhi minister Atishi to back her statement on BJP's poaching bid with facts.
The move by the poll body comes days after Atishi claimed that the BJP approached her through a "very close" person to join the party or be prepared to be nabbed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) within a month.
"I was approached by BJP through a person very close to me who asked me to join BJP to save and enhance my political career or I will be arrested within a month,” Atishi had said at a press conference.
Later, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva challenged the AAP leader Atishi to provide details of her allegation that she was approached to join BJP or be prepared for a legal action.

The next day, Bhartiya Janata Party's (BJP) Delhi unit sent a defamation notice to Delhi minister Atishi and demanded a public apology for her claim that the saffron party approached her.
"Atishi failed to provide evidence of who approached her, how and when. The AAP is undergoing a crisis in Delhi, which is why they are making such baseless allegations out of frustration. But we will not let her get away with this," Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said while addressing a press conference.
