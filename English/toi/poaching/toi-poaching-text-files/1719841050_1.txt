Scrambled Eggs: Scrambled eggs are a popular choice for breakfast and can be prepared using minimal oil or butter. While scrambled eggs are high in protein and provide essential nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and selenium, the addition of excess fats during cooking can increase their calorie and fat content. To maximize the health benefits of scrambled eggs, opt for cooking methods that use minimal added fats and avoid overcooking, as this can lead to nutrient loss.
Omelettes: Omelettes offer a versatile and delicious way to enjoy eggs, allowing for endless variations with added vegetables, herbs, and cheese. While omelettes are a nutritious option when prepared with wholesome ingredients, they can also be high in calories and saturated fats if cooked with excessive amounts of cheese or oil. To optimize the health benefits of omelettes, incorporate plenty of vegetables for added fiber and nutrients while using minimal amounts of cheese and healthy cooking oils.
Soft-Boiled Eggs: Soft-boiled eggs are cooked for a shorter duration than hard-boiled eggs, resulting in a creamy texture with a slightly runny yolk. Soft-boiled eggs are a good source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, including vitamin D and choline. However, it's essential to cook soft-boiled eggs thoroughly to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses, especially for vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, young children, and older adults.

Hard-Boiled Eggs: Hard-boiled eggs are cooked until both the white and yolk are firm, making them convenient for on-the-go snacks or meal prep. Hard-boiled eggs are rich in protein and provide essential nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin D, and iron. Studies have shown that consuming hard-boiled eggs as part of a balanced diet can promote feelings of fullness and aid in weight management by reducing calorie intake throughout the day.
