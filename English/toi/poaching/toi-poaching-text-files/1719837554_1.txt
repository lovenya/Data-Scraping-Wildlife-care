However, the leaders are also wary of switching sides because people have been questioning them about why there was a need to change a party.

BJP is currently active in poaching leaders from other parties as they have clarity on their nominee to contest the Munugode bypoll. K Raj Gopal Reddy’s candidacy would be announced soon, and he began actively camping in the assembly segment. TRS and Congress are playing it safe for the time being because their candidates are to be announced and there is a fear of dissidence once the nominee is announced. Both parties have more than three aspirants each.
Caste groups are also being approached for garnering support. “But some are having a good time with offers made by political parties, though the mood of the voters is not year clear,” a local leader, who retired from politics, said.
