Ranchi/Raipur: The political crisis in Jharkhand took a new twist on Tuesday after chief minister Hemant Soren flew out 33 ‘MLAs of the 49-strong UPA government to a Raipur resort, amid growing concerns of poaching attempts by rival BJP.
With governor Ramesh Bais mum on the contents of a sealed EC letter, which might disqualify Soren as an MLA in the office-of-profit case filed by the BJP over a mining lease contract, Soren decided to send all his ‘vulnerable’ legislators to Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh to ensure they can fly back for a floor test, if required.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Soren was personally present at the airport to dispatch the 32 MLAs, comprising 19 from JMM, 12 from Congress and a lone RJD member. They were later escorted by state Congress president Rajesh Thakur to a resort in Naya Raipur in an A-320 chartered airbus that came from Kolkata.
