Panaji: A day after alleging that BJP is attempting to poach Congress candidates, Congress fired a fresh salvo, claiming to be in possession of an audio recording which purportedly proves that a senior BJP minister is offering money to postal ballot voters. 
State Congress president Girish Chodankar has hinted that Congress would release the audio recording to back its claims that BJP is trying to lure and coerce police personnel and government officials who are set to cast their vote using postal ballot papers.
“I have audio evidence to prove the senior minister offering money for ballot votes. Will Goa chief electoral officer Kunal act if the audio is released?” Chodankar said.
Congress has repeatedly said that the Election Commission authorities are not acting on concerns raised by the opposition. “The concept of free and fair elections mandate that nobody is unduly influenced while exercising constitutional right to vote,” Congress said.
