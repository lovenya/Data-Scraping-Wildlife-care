NEW DELHI: Congress and Trinamool Congress engaged in a war of words on Tuesday, accusing one another of working against opposition unity, a day after the grand old party's lone MLA in West Bengal Bayron Biswas crossed over to TMC. Congress lashed out at TMC, saying such "poaching" is not designed to strengthen opposition unity and only serves BJP's objectives. TMC hit back following Jairam Ramesh's statement, accusing Congress of "breaching trust".
The spat between the two parties assumes significance, coming as it does at a time when efforts are underway to forge a united opposition to take on BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. A gathering of opposition parties is likely in Patna in June. "Congress breaches trust on Opposition unity and then expects bouquets of roses! And about strengthening BJP? Grow up," TMC MP Derek O' Brien said in a tweet, attaching Ramesh's post in the comments.
Speaking to the media in Kolkata, Mamata Banerjee harped on opposition unity for 2024 polls. "We (like-minded opposition parties) are all together at the national level. At the state level, parties must understand that regional parties have their own obligations," she said.
Earlier, Ramesh said, "Three months after he was elected as a Congress MLA in a historic victory, Bayron Biswas has been lured away by TMC in West Bengal... This is a complete betrayal of the mandate of the people of Sagardighi assembly constituency.... Such poaching which has happened earlier in Goa, Meghalaya, Tripura and other states is not designed to strengthen opposition unity and only serves BJP's objectives."
