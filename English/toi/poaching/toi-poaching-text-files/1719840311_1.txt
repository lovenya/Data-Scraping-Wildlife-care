BHOPAL: Eleven people were arrested by the state forest department from a village in Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh for their alleged involvement in poaching a tiger using an electric wire trap. 
Incident was reported from the South Shahdol division in the Jaitpur forest area near Ghorve and Shahi of Lafda Beat, where these villagers resorted to extracting the tiger's whiskers before disposing of the carcass in a bid to erase evidence of their crime.
Rural farmers, aiming to protect their crops from damage caused by wild pigs, often employ electric nets across their fields, say officers. However, in this instance, the setup was targeted for poaching wild boars and deer. However, the tiger fell victim to the snare.
Exploiting the situation for personal gain, the villagers removed the tiger's whiskers, which they believed possessed mystical powers capable of bestowing wealth and treating various illnesses.
The Forest Department intervened upon discovering this act, identifying the suspects and charging them under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act.
Led by Jaitpur ranger and personnel under DFO Shraddha Pendre from the South Forest Division of the Shahdol Forest Department, officials spearheaded the investigation into this occurrence. Pendre confirmed the confiscation of the tiger's whiskers and assured appropriate measures were taken.
Those detained in connection with this case were identified as Kamla Singh, Ramcharan Singh, Anand Kumar Singh, Vinod Singh, Bal Singh, Dillon Singh, Raju Singh, Sushil Singh, Ramdas Singh, Ramkhelawan Singh, and Jitendra Singh.
An inspection of the tiger's carcass indicated that the hunting incident occurred approximately ten days prior, resulting in severe damage to the animal due to the electric shock.
Sources revealed that following the tiger's death, villagers extracted its teeth, nails, and whiskers. Allegations surfaced regarding the deliberate incineration of the tiger's remains post-hunt, a strategic move aimed at destroying evidence. The arrested suspects justified their use of electric currents to forest authorities, citing protection against wild boars notorious for causing crop damage in local fields.
