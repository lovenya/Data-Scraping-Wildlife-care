Chandigarh: Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa on Tuesday mocked the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by chief minister Bhagwant Mann for poaching leaders from the Congress party.
“This shows how the AAP has gone completely bankrupt in Punjab within a year of coming to power. It has failed to find not even a single candidate worth his salt from the party and had to poach from the Congress party to contest the Jalandhar byelection,” said Bajwa.
The leader of opposition stated that even Surinder Chaudhary, who joined AAP on Monday in the presence of Bhagwant Mann, was a former Congress MLA and son of party leader late Chaudhary Jagjit Singh.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe Congress leader said judging from the Kartarpur rally of the AAP on Monday, one could easily make out how under the leadership of Bhagwant Man, AAP would lose yet another bypoll in the state.
