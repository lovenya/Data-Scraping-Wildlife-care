HYDERABAD: Despite the ruling TRS having a majority of voters on its side to win both Khammam and Medak MLC local authorities' seats, the Congress entered into the electoral fray from these two seats to keep its flock together and avoid poaching of its elected representatives by the ruling TRS. 
The Congress leadership also did not want to give these two seats unanimously to the ruling TRS.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoCongress MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy has said he will quit the TPCC working president post if the party fails to poll at least 230 votes. T Nirmala, wife of Jayaprakash Reddy is in fray from Medak seat.
"It's a moral victory for the Congress as we entered into the electoral fray despite not having numbers to win. We wanted to show the ruling TRS that they cannot buy Congress voters with money. We will poll a minimum of 230 votes. There is also a possibility of some of the TRS and BJP members having cast their vote in favour of Congress candidate," he said
Polling for Khammam local authorities' seat witnessed mild tension with 96.09% voters casting their vote. Congress leaders staged a protest in Khammam complaining that ZP Chairman L Kamal Raju and others remained in the polling station even after casting their vote. They alleged that the ruling TRS tried to influence the voters. The situation was brought under control with the intervention of the police.
