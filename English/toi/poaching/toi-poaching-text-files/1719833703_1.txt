PANAJI: The All India Congress Committee (AICC) senior election observer P Chidambaram on Sunday said the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has poached Congress's leaders in Goa. The first, it was Luizinho Faleiro. 
Four days after Congress announced the first list on December 16, they poached Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, Chidambaram told reporters throwing light on why Congress has cold shoulders the Bengal party.

"The suggestion from the TMC for the alliance was received on December 24, but even after that, they took our leaders from Vasco and Mormugao. All these facts were before the AICC. I had no instruction to hold talks, so the matter was closed,” the senior Congress leader said.

Besides, Congress has lost several grassroots workers and mid-level functionaries since the TMC unleashed its Goa plan in September last year. 
Earlier, this week, the TMC functionaries had said Chidambaram should be held responsible if BJP goes on to win the 2022 assembly election and form the government in Goa. 
The TMC has formed an alliance with the Goa-based regional party, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) whereas Congress has entered into a pre-poll alliance with the Goa Forward Party (GFP), also a Goa regional party.
