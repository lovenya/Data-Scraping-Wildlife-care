RAIPUR: Worried over the possibility of attempts at “political poaching”, at least 12 candidates of Congress-led Mahajot in Assam have been brought to Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh and were accommodated at a private resort in Nava Raipur.
The move to bring more candidates to Chhattisgarh comes four days after nearly 22 candidates of AIUDF were shifted to Congress-ruled Rajasthan and lodged in a hotel in Jaipur.As elections came to a close in the border state, AIUDF is apparently playing safe, sensing that there would be an attempt to sabotage the peoples’ mandate.
Indications are that the majority of the candidates, who have reached Raipur, belonged to the Bodoland Peoples Front, which is part of the Congress-led AIUDF alliance in Assam. State Congress sources neither confirmed nor denied about Assam candidates being shifted to Chhattisgarh to keep them safe from ‘poaching’ and thwart any attempt to rob the mandate. 
Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and his team of party workers had led an intensive campaign for the Congress in Assam to unseat the BJP from power—making the fight tough and unpredictable.
