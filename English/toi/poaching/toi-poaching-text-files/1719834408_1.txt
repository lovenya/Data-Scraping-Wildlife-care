Lucknow: The turtles that were poached from Lucknow’s Gomti river and confiscated in Hyderabad in early August finally made their way back to Lucknow’s Kukrail gharial centre. 
The state forest department will keep the rescued wildlife under quarantine for 29 days at the centre. 
As many as 266 Indian tent turtles and Indian roofed turtles were airlifted from Hyderabad to Lucknow by the state forest department and the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) on Sunday.

The roofed turtle is a protected species. Principal chief conservator of forests, wildlife, Pawan Kumar Sharma, said, “The two offenders detained in Hyderabad confessed to have poached the turtles from the Gomti river near Lucknow.” 
The turtles were temporarily housed in Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, for safe custody.
The turtles would be released in the Gomti around mid-October. 
This was the second time that such a large number of turtles have been rescued by the state forest department from outside Uttar Pradesh and rehabilitated in the wild.
