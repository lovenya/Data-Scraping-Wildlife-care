New CCTV footage has emerged, revealing a startling development as members of Lawrence Bishnoi's gang opened fire outside the residence of Bollywood superstar Salman Khan during the early hours of Sunday morning. 
The footage, believed to be from security cameras installed around Khan's residence, captures the chilling moment when two individuals on a motorcycle slow down upon reaching Salman's house.While one individual rides the bike, the other, positioned as the pillion rider, fires shots aimed at the actor's home before fleeing the scene. The footage distinctly captures the gun being discharged three times.

Reports suggest that the attack was orchestrated by Rohit Godara, associated with Bishnoi's gang in Rajasthan. Police, with the help of CCTV footage were able to identify the assailants. According to reports, one of the suspects was identified as Vishal, also known as Kalu. He is believed to be working under Rohit Godara, who operates the Bishnoi's Gang in Rajasthan.

An FIR was filed earlier today, and subsequently, the case was transferred to the crime branch. Sources indicate that both suspects have fled from Mumbai and abandoned their bike.
While at first there were no leads on the attackers, the assailants were later linked to Lawrence Bishnoi's mafia outfit, which claimed responsibility for the attack. Anmol Bishnoi, Lawrence Bishnoi's brother based in the US, issued a foreboding warning to Salman Khan via Facebook, describing the incident as a "first and last warning." He ominously hinted that any future confrontation would result in direct targeting of the actor.

The ongoing threat to Khan's safety traces back to the 1998 blackbuck poaching incident in Rajasthan, which led to persistent death threats from the Bishnoi gang. In 2022, Salim Khan, Salman Khan's father, discovered a note during a morning stroll near their residence, hinting at impending danger. The note referenced Sidhu Moosewala, a Punjabi rapper who was tragically shot dead near his home.

In response to these threats, the Mumbai police escalated Salman's security detail, issuing him a permit for a gun license. Additionally, the actor has invested in a new bullet-proof SUV for added protection during his movements.
