NEW DELHI: Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio is quite impressed with Assam government's efforts to stop rhino poaching.
Taking to Instagram, the 'Titanic' star penned a note, applauding Assam's accomplishment in ending the poaching of the endangered greater one-horned rhinoceros at Kaziranga National Park.

He wrote, "In 2021, the government of the Indian state of Assam set out to end the poaching of the Endangered Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros in Kaziranga National Park following the killing of around 190 animals for their horns between 2000 and 2021.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoIn 2022, they met their goal and no rhinos were poached in the area for the first time since 1977."

This triumph in India also comes with more good news, as @wwf also reports that the world population of the rare rhino soared to around 3,700 from about 200 at the turn of the 20th century," Leonardo added. Kaziranga National Park (KNP), which is located in the floodplains of the Brahmaputra river, is the biggest habitat for one-horned rhinos globally and draws visitors from across the globe.
In 2015 and 2016, the number of rhinos killed by poachers was 17 and 18, respectively, which subsequently declined to two in 2020 and 2021 and zero in the year 2022.
