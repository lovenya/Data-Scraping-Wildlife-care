Rohan Bhate, an honorary wildlife warden from Satara and a member of the wildlife crime control bureau, said, "A few days back, the poachers were spotted in the camera traps set in the buffer zone of the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve for research purposes. These poachers were walking inside the core zone of the forest with a torch, stick and gun. The locals have claimed that these persons are routine hunters.
To avoid such hunting and poaching incidents, the approval of the Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) at the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve on an immediate basis is necessary, added Bhate.
