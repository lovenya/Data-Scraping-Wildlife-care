CHANDIGARH: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Tuesday ridiculed AAP’s allegations that the BJP was trying to poach AAP MLAs by offering them Rs 20-25 crore each.
The PPCC president said the BJP was quite capable of buying MLAs and had a history of poaching opposition MLAs and destabilising governments, but in the present case, AAP appeared to be trying to divert public attention from its own failures.

"Or maybe there is some revolt brewing within the AAP that MLAs are feeling restless and the party leadership is trying to preempt any such move," he said.

Earlier, they alleged that the BJP was trying to buy their MLAs in Delhi and now they are repeating the same story in Punjab, he said, while asking AAP to name MLAs who were being approached and name the people who were trying to "buy" them.
He pointed out that there must be someone who approached the MLAs or they must have received phone calls. "Why not present those MLAs before media and let them tell it themselves as how, when and where they were approached and from which phone numbers they received the calls?" he said, adding that the AAP could also lodge a complaint with the police as it was a criminal offence when somebody tried to bribe someone.
"Assuming that you won’t be heard in Delhi as you have often been accusing Delhi Police of bias against you, why not lodge a complaint in Punjab where the police force is under you and where your MLAs have been attempted to be bribed?" the P PCC president said.
