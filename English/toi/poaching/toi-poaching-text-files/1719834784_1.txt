AMRITSAR: Instead of reviving broken alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal, BJP in Punjab appears to be strengthening itself with the power of turncoats even as the saffron party has been able to successfully rope in handful of senior but significant Congress leaders in its fold and rumours abound that a few ‘staunch’ Akali leaders could follow the suit. 
 BJP leader Jagmohan Singh Raju, who recently lost the assembly elections from Amritsar East assembly constituency, uploaded photographs on his Facebook page where he is seen along with former SAD MLA from Ajnala Amarpal Singh Bony who, according to Raju’s post, has congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for completion of eight years of his regime and also assured to propagate Modi’s public welfare policies . 
 Sources informed that BJP had been sending the feelers to gauze the mood of the Akali camp after its drubbing in the last assembly elections.
