Microsoft has finalised a deal with Inflection AI, agreeing to pay a substantial sum of $650 million. As part of the arrangement, Microsoft will pay $620 million towards licensing Inflection's AI models, with an additional $30 million designated for relinquishing any legal claims associated with the mass recruitment. Clearly, Microsoft doesn’t want to deal with the legal hassles of poaching employees from a startup that it hasn’t really acquired.The financial intricacies were initially reported by The Information and corroborated by sources familiar with the matter.
This development comes hot on the heels of Microsoft's surprising announcement this week, revealing the hiring of key figures from Inflection, including co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karen Simonyan, alongside a significant portion of the startup's workforce comprising approximately 70 employees. 
While resembling an "acqui-hire" scenario, this transaction diverges by omitting a direct acquisition component, a move that has drawn attention from legal and industry experts who speculate potential antitrust implications with US regulators, given the escalating scrutiny on Big Tech's AI investments and partnerships. Microsoft had to undergo many investigations when it acquired Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in 2022. 
Neither Microsoft nor Inflection AI has made any comment on the matter.
However, as per the report, the agreement not only ensures the satisfaction of Inflection's investors but also underscores a modest return on investment, deviating from earlier projections for the startup, which had been valued at $4 billion following a substantial funding round of $1.3 billion last year.
Inflection AI gained prominence in the tech sphere with the introduction of Pi, a chatbot positioned as a personalised assistant boasting superior reliability and amiability compared to its counterparts. Despite initial excitement surrounding its innovative offerings, Inflection struggled to solidify a sustainable business model, as acknowledged by Suleyman in recent statements to Bloomberg.
