MADURAI: Sri Lankan navy apprehended 15 Indian fishermen and their 2 trawlers which sailed from the Rameswaram fishing jetty on Saturday.
The 2 boats were among 500 fishing trawlers which went fishing after almost a week since the fisheries department suspended issuing tokens - permission to undertake fishing - in view of turbulent sea conditions in the Gulf of Mannar.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
