Samal is a ranger-in-charge, Behera a beat forester and Das a guard. “The trio allegedly forced Purty to consume poison,” an official said. The trio had suspected Purty, a contractual worker of the forest department, of leaking out information to higher authorities about the incident in the reserve located in Mayurbhanj district.
