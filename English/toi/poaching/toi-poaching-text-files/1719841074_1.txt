Speaking about telling the compelling story in ‘Poacher’, Mehta earlier told PTI, "I generally pick subjects according to my conscience... That's why I did 'Delhi Crime' and that's certainly why I did 'Poacher'. So, I'm guided by what I want to spend my time on as a human being. In this case, I wanted to spend my time with these amazing wildlife crime fighters on whom the story is based.”
