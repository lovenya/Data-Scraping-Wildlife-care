NAGPUR: There is no let-up in tiger deaths in Maharashtra. One more tiger was found poached in Aheri on Thursday, reports Vijay Pinjarkar. The incident came to the notice of villagers after a stray dog was found chewing on a tiger bone.
According to sources, an agricultural field is hardly 50 metres away from the spot where the carcass was found. It is suspected that the tigress was electrocuted, after which its body parts were removed.Talking to TOI, Kishore Mankar, conservator of forests, Gadchiroli circle, said: “As all four paws and skull of the animal are missing, it indicates poaching. It seems to be the handiwork of local poachers. The carcass was found in reserve forest compartment number 615.”
