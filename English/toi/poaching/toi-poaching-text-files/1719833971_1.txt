NAGPUR: The Mahendri forest in Warud tehsil under Amravati Circle witnessed its first casualty in the form of a leopard after it was declared a conservation reserve by the state wildlife board (SWBL) on December 4.
According to sources, the male leopard carcass was found near Bhembali village on the fringes of Mahendri and is said to be two days old but the Warud foresters learnt about the incident on Tuesday afternoon.
During a spot panchnama, foresters suspected the death must have occurred after the animal fell from the tree, the body of the leopard had grievous injury marks on the face and other parts.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Sources apprehend it to be a case of poisoning as the tongue of the animal had turned black. It seems the animal must have been killed elsewhere and dumped at the spot. However, the post-mortem which will be conducted on Wednesday will only confirm the exact cause of death. 
The suspected poaching of the leopard has sparked criticism against the lack of protection in the Mahendri forest by the Amravati officials. Mahendri was initially proposed to be a sanctuary but a section of forest officials opposed the move.
“If Mahendri is declared a sanctuary such incidents can be avoided. The killing of leopard also exposes poor protection and patrolling in the forest area,” said Rajendra Mane, a farmer from Warud who supported the sanctuary plan.
