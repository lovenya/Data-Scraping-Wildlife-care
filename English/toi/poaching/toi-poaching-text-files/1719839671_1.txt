Repeated attempts to contact Tadoba officials proved futile. However, sources say a seven-member team constituted by the chief wildlife warden is engaged in intense data collection on poaching.
State PCCF (wildlife) Maheep Gupta said, “I still have no confirmed communication that the tiger skin that was seized in Guwahati was from here. However, as per the call detail records identified by the Melghat cyber cell, the movement of these poachers was in Gadchiroli and Chandrapur in the last 3-4 months.”
