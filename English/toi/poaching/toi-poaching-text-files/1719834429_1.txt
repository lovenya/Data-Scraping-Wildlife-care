Guwahati: Assam recorded the first case of poaching of a one-horned rhino this year at Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site, as the carcass of a full-grown rhino was found in the Kohora range of the park on Thursday.
The incident came to light just four days after the state government claimed on Sunday that KNP had recorded the lowest number of rhino poaching last year, since 2000.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAs per government data, the tally had gone down to only one last year, the lowest in 21 years. The lone case was reported from the Kohora range in April last year, before the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led government took charge in May.
KNP field director P Sivakumar said, “The incident took place on Wednesday night. The rhino was recovered with gunshot wounds, while the horn was taken away by the poachers. The rhino was around 25-30 years old.” He added that the KNP authority had already launched a search operation, using sniffer dogs to track and nab the poachers.
While park authorities suspect that the poachers may have entered from the side of Biswanath district, the field director said they had adopted different strategies to deal with the poaching menace and as a result the numbers had remarkably come down last year. “The anti-poaching task force, formed last year to check rhino poaching in the park, has been keeping round-the-clock vigil in poaching prone zones. Also, removal of encroachments along contagious areas and adding those to the park and strict monitoring helped in preventing poaching,” he said.
