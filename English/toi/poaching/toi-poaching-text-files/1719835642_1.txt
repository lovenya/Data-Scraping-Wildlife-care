Coimbatore/Udhagamandalam: Four days after an elephant carcass was found with a tusk missing in Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR), forest department officials recovered the tusk from a village on Thursday.
The tusk, wrapped in a sack, was hidden in a rock crevice in Karattur circle of Udumalpet forest range. “It has been identified as that of the wild elephant, which was found dead on August 29 at Sadayanparai in Karattur circle,” said ATR deputy director M G Ganesan.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
A team of forest personnel formed to crack the case were patrolling the locality around 3pm when they found the tusk. It is 1.5m long and weighs 15kg.
Principal chief conservator of forests Shekar Kumar Niraj refused to divulge the name of the village. “It will hinder the ongoing investigation,” he told TOI. “It is the first time in Tamil Nadu that a poaching case has been cracked within four days of occurrence.”

While the elephant had lost one of its tusks long back in a suspected fight with another elephant, the other tusk was missing from the carcass, raising suspicion that it could be a case of poaching. Postmortem revealed that there were no external injuries. The cause of death could not be ascertained. Forest veterinarian A Sukumar said that an axe was used to remove the tusk. 
Forest officials are yet to identify the culprits. “The team has intensified efforts to trace the culprits,” Ganesan said. “Investigation is being conducted scientifically. We are using DNA profiling and analysing cellphone calls made around the time in the area,” he added.
