Salman Khan recently opened up about his Blackbuck poaching case for the first time. According to him, he has full faith in the judiciary and he will accept the decision of the judges.
In an interview with a news portal, Salman said that he seriously doesn't know what the decision would be. According to him, our judiciary is very capable. The actor added that whatever the decision would be, he would accept.

Salman was accused of hunting down Chinkaras at Bawad in Mathania near Jodhpur in September 1998 during the shooting of Sooraj Barjatya’s ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’.A complaint against the actor was filed by the members of the Bishnoi community. Bishnois believe that blackbucks are the reincarnation of their spiritual leader, Bhagwan Jambeshwar, also known as Jambaji.

The ‘Dabangg’ star was also arrested the same year but was later granted bail. It was in July 2016 that Salman was acquitted by the Rajasthan High Court in the case. The High Court had said that there was no evidence against Khan. However, the Rajasthan government later filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court’s decision.
He was last seen in ‘Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan’ along with Pooja Hegde and others. The film got mixed reviews from the audience and the critics alike. Next, he will be seen in ‘Tiger 3’ with Katrina Kaif and Emraan Hashmi.
