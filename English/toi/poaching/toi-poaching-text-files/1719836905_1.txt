HYDERABAD: All eyes will be on TRS supremo and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao when he addresses a public meeting at Chandur town in Munugode constituency on Sunday. He has so far maintained a stoic silence on the alleged attempt to bribe TRS MLAs and is expected to finally attack BJP on the issue in his speech. This will also be his first public meeting after he floated Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) on October 5.
The meeting will be crucial also because it will be held in the midst of the slog overs of campaigning for the Munugode bypoll, considered by many to be the semifinal for the assembly elections in 2023. Sources said KCR has been personally monitoring the TRS campaign in the constituency and had even taken responsibility for one village - Lenkalapally. The meeting on Sunday will be his second visit to the constituency before voting. He had last visited Munugode on August 20.
Sources said for the public meeting, the party has decided to mobilise voters from the constituency, not outsiders. Initially, the party planned a massive public meeting bringing from other parts of erstwhile Nalgonda district.
With the high-octane campaign coming to an end on November 1, all the parties have been making last-ditch efforts to woo the voters. BJP is hoping for a final push by holding small public meetings in nine places. BJP national president J P Nadda was expected to attend the meetings on October 31, but has since cancelled his trip. Congress candidate Palvai Sravanthi is also intensifying her campaign.
