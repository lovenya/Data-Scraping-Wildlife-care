Led by Tiger Reserve deputy director Varun Jain, the collaborative team, including officials from Chhattisgarh’s Udanti Sitanadi Tiger Reserve and Odisha’s Sinapali Forest Area, acted on received information to conduct the rescue operation.
The poachers apprehended during the operation are identified as Dinesh Majhi, 43, and Turpan Majhi, 61, both residents of Nangalbod in Nuapada district (Odisha), and Chaitanya Majhi, 57, from Gendulpani, Nuapada, Odisha. The poachers admitted to capturing the pangolin from the Odisha forest range bordering Chhattisgarh, according to statements from Jain.
In addition to the successful rescue, the anti-poaching team confiscated three motorcycles and mobile phones from the accused. The perpetrators were handed over to the Sinapali forest division for further legal action. Two additional suspects have been taken into custody for investigation, with the arrest of three more persons expected in the coming days. Jain stated that a thorough investigation will determine whether a syndicate is operating behind the smuggling.

The poachers engage in smuggling pangolins to make money, driven by a combination of economic motives and superstition. Some believe that possessing pangolin scales can bring prosperity.
The cyber cell of Dhamtari played a crucial role in the successful execution of the rescue operation, ensuring the safe release of the pangolin in the Odisha forest on Saturday, as confirmed by Jain.
Responding to questions about the price of the pangolin and its scales, Jain emphasized that such information is not disclosed to discourage wildlife smuggling, aligning with ethical considerations in wildlife conservation.
