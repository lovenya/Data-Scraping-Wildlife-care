Later in the day, Kejriwal and Atishi are scheduled to lay the foundation stones of two schools in Rohini.
On January 27, both Kejriwal and Atishi alleged that the BJP was attempting to lure AAP MLAs with offers of Rs 25 crore each and a ticket to contest in the upcoming assembly polls, aiming to overthrow the AAP government.
The BJP dismissed these allegations as "false" and "baseless," challenging the chief minister to provide evidence supporting his claims.
