HYDERABAD: After Kaushik Reddy’s episode, Congress has decided not to project anyone as its likely candidate to contest Huzurabad bypoll.
A strategy to keep the names of top three contenders under wraps will be implemented to avoid poaching of its candidates by the ruling TRS. 
On his part, former MP from Karimnagar Ponnam Prabhakar has said he is not keen on entering the electoral fray from Huzurabad.
Kaushik, who was touted as the main candidate from Congress for the Huzurabad bypoll, resigned from the party on Monday. He is likely to join the TRS soon. He had thrown a challenge to TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy and Prabhakar to contest the Huzurabad by-election and try not to lose the deposit.
