Premier League giants Manchester United officially announced on Saturday the appointment of Omar Berrada as the club's new CEO, securing his services after luring him away from their local rivals Manchester City.
"Manchester United is pleased to announce the appointment of Omar Berrada as its new CEO," said a statement from the Old Trafford club. "The club is determined to put football and performance on the pitch back at the heart of everything we do.PollHas Virat Kohli taken the right decision to announce retirement from T20Is?YesNoOmar's appointment represents the first step on this journey.
"It is our stated ambition to re-establish Manchester United as a title-winning club."
Berrada stepped down from his position as the head of football operations at City Football Group, the entity overseeing the English champions and a collection of other clubs worldwide.
"Manchester City Football Club can confirm that Omar Berrada has resigned from his role as Chief Football Operations Officer at City Football Group," City said in a statement.
"The club understands his decision to look for a new challenge and he leaves with our thanks and best wishes."
Berrada joined City in 2011 from Barcelona, collaborating with City Football Group's CEO, Ferran Soriano, and City's director of football, Txiki Begiristain.
The trio is recognized for their role in transforming City into a highly efficient commercial entity off the field, contributing significantly to the club's success under manager Pep Guardiola.
Berrada's recent appointment at United represents one of the initial significant moves orchestrated by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, who acquired a 25 percent stake in United for $1.3 billion.
United have been operating without a permanent CEO since the departure of Richard Arnold at the end of the previous year.
