HARIDWAR: Amid the ongoing Kanwar Yatra, patrolling teams have been deployed in the forests of Haridwar after officials expressed concern over recent sightings of tigers in the Shyampur range of the Haridwar division, which could attract poachers. They said patrolling gets difficult in monsoon and poachers, posing as Kanwarias, could potentially enter the forests, especially during the yatra.
DFO Haridwar Neeraj Sharma said, "While Kanwariyas visit with faith and no previous incidents of poaching have been reported, poachers could take advantage of the Kanwar Yatra to infiltrate the forests.Teams have been deployed in four ranges to prevent poaching, and joint patrolling efforts are being carried out."
The Kanwar Yatra is currently in full swing, with an estimated 4 crore Kanwariyas expected to visit the city during this period. The Haridwar, Shyampur, Kahnpur, and Chidiyapur ranges of the Haridwar forest division are particularly vulnerable due to the proximity to residential areas, increasing the risk of both man-animal conflicts and poaching activities. Twenty teams have been deployed to keep a check on man-animal conflicts, besides the ones to prevent poaching.
