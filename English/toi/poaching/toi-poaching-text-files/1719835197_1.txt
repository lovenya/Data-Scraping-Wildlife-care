Bijnor: With an aim to protect animals from poachers and also safeguard farmers’ interests, officials of the Corbett National Park, Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR) and World Wide Fund for Nature along with local farmers held a two-day workshop near Kalagarh. 
Anil Kumar Patel, Bijnor divisional forest officer, said, “In the workshop, we invited views of villagers and suggested to them how to put an end to man-animal conflict.” 
Sub divisional forest officer Hari Singh said, “There are 15 villages along ATR and Corbett.Volunteers who work for preservation of wildlife in these villages and locals participated in the workshop.” 
At the workshop, farmers aired their grievances pointing out that wild animals enter their fields and destroy crops but getting compensation for their loss takes time. Sometimes, carnivores lift their cattle as well, said Singh.
