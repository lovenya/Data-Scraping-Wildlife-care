Coimbatore: Forest department officials conducted a search at a house at Mugasimangalam village near Alandurai on Saturday and seized three avuttukkai (country made bombs) used for hunting wild animals. They also secured house owner Velusamy, 60, a daily wage labourer, and handed him over to the Alandurai police to arrest him under the Explosives Act.
According to an official source, Madukkarai forest range officer P Santhiya and team had visited Velusamy’s house on Friday evening based on a specific tip that the daily wage labourer was cooking wild boar meat at his residence.“They found more than two kilograms of wild boar meat at the house.

After getting permission from higher officials, he said, the team conducted a search at Velusamy’s house on Saturday morning and found three avuttukkai. “When the officials questioned Velusamy, he told them that he had got them from another person for hunting wild boars in the reserve forest and adjacent to the forest boundaries,” the source said
