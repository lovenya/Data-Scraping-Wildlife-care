Raipur: Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel alleged on Monday that the BJP was attempting to lure Congress MLAs, offering them Lok Sabha seats and ministerial positions in the state.
“One of our MLAs informed me that he was approached to switch sides. Offers such as ministerial positions and Lok Sabha tickets are being extended,” he told reporters before departing for Delhi.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“All these developments, whether in Bihar, Maharashtra, or any other state, clearly indicate that the BJP is not confident about its prospects in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. These attempts at political manipulation and poaching suggest that the BJP is losing ground,” he said. Baghel, however, declined to comment on reports regarding former MP chief minister Kamalnath moving closer to the BJP, stating that he has not discussed the issue with the senior Congress leader.
Responding to the BJP's claim about the beginning of an era of good governance in Chhattisgarh, the former minister said, “It's visible now. Security camps are being attacked. Several incidents have been reported from the deputy chief minister’s constituency, while cases of cow smuggling have also come to light,” he added. TNN
