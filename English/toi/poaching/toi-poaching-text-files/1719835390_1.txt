HYDERABAD: Demanding a judicial investigation into the alleged “poaching efforts” involving TRS MLAs, BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar challenged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to come to the Yadadri temple and swear that he had no prior knowledge of the incident.
In a late-night press conference on Wednesday, Sanjay said: “It’s entirely a fake drama, scripted by Pragathi Bhavan.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWe are ready to come to the temple. The police have narrated a laughable drama.” 
He said, “This is akin to the drama involving a TRS minister in the past, where police falsely said that a murder attempt was made on him.”
Sanjay slammed chief minister KCR, asking why he was dragging priests into the episode. “He is attempting to taint the image of Hindu Dharma. Son of a TRS MLA is involved in this.”

What about them? Chief minister should expose the footage of Pragathi Bhavan. People are laughing at this incident.”
Sanjay claimed that TRS legislators are both victims and criminals. “Who will buy such MLAs without any face value. If they claim 100 crore is involved, then how much has TRS spent in the past to get Congress MLAs?”
