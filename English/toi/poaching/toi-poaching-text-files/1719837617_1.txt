Madurai: The forest officials and staff are keeping an extra vigil along the forest boundaries as the region celebrates Diwali. Usually poaching incidents go up during the festival time as the people living in the forest fringes tend to look for cheap meat from the forest areas.

Madurai forest division has 29,000 hectares of forest cover that include tropic dry evergreen forests in the fringes of the district, dry deciduous forests, shrub forests in three ranges namely Madurai, Sholavandhan and Usilampatti. Wild animals in Madurai forests include Indian gaurs, deer, hare, jackals, bears, boars and reptiles. There is also an independent scattered deer population in the district’s water bodies in Sivarakottai region.
The division has the manpower of 23 forest guards, 16 forest watchers and six rangers. Madurai district forest officer Gurusamy Dabala said that special teams were formed with the forest staffers, especially at Usilampatti and Sholavandhan range. The range officers are instructed to take out night patrols along the forest boundaries to look for suspicious activities. “We have not booked any cases of poaching but we are keeping extra vigil so that the poachers don’t kill wild animals for Diwali celebrations,” he said.
Diwali is also a season of home coming for the people working in other places. For the ones looking for some adventure and private spot for boozing, forest fringes are ideal places. “We don’t want to take chances with the safety of forests and we will take strict action against anyone indulging in wildlife crimes,” said the DFO.
