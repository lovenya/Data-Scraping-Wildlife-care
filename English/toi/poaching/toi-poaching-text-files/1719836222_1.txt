Aurangabad: The NCP leaders are upset with their alliance partner Shiv Sena for pulling their party workers in its fold.
State health minister Rajesh Tope, during the NCP party worker’s meet held on Monday, expressed unhappiness over two Shiv Sena ministers — Sandipan Bhumre and Abdul Sattar — trying to put a dent on NCP by making NCP workers switch over to Sena. 
Bhumre currently is the minister of state for employment guarantee and horticulture, while Sattar is the minister of state for revenue.Tope made the statement in the presence of MP Supriya Sule, who was in the city to address the party workers’ meet.
In the video, which is currently being circulated on social media, Tope can be heard saying, “It is true that our party workers are facing problems. I most courteously would like to say to Bhumre Saheb and Sattar Saheb that just because you are in the government, you will make our party workers switch over to Shiv Sena.”

Bhumre refuted the allegations. Speaking to newsmen, Bhumre said, “I can say for sure that so far, I have not inducted even one NCP office-bearer or party worker into Shiv Sena. The allegations are absolutely false. I am into politics for over three decades. Had I opted for coercive tactics to bring other party workers into our fold, I would not have survived in politics.”
He went on to state that there are few party workers who have a tendency to make such wild allegations against other party leaders, “I personally ensure that people from Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena are taken along and nobody is ignored.”
Despite repeated attempts, Abdul Sattar could not be reached for his comments.
