PANAJI: AICC senior election observer P Chidambaram on Sunday said that TMC has been poaching Congressmen in Goa. 
First, it was Luizinho Faleiro and four days after Congress announced its first list on December 16, they poached Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, he told reporters, on why Congress has cold-shouldered TMC. 
“The suggestion from TMC for an alliance was received on December 24, but even after that, they took our members from Vasco and Mormugao.All these facts were before Congress leadership, and I had no instruction to hold any talks, so the matter was closed,” Chidambaram said.
Congress has also lost several grassroot workers and mid-level functionaries since TMC started implementing its plan for the Goa legislative assembly elections.
Earlier this week, TMC functionaries had said Chidambaram should be held responsible if BJP wins the upcoming assembly elections and forms the government in Goa.
