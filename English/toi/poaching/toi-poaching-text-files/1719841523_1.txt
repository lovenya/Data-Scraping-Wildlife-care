GUWAHATI: A poaching attempt at Assam's Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) was thwarted on Saturday with the killing of a gang member in a gun battle with forest guards, officials said. 
Sources said about two to three others in the gang escaped. A rifle and ammunition seized from the spot suggested the gang was trying to poach a rhino, KNPTR director Sonali Ghosh said.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo"A few unknown people were walking inside the park illegally. When challenged, they opened fire, after which the patrolling party retaliated. Forest guards later searched the area and found the body of a poacher," Ghosh said. The deceased has not been identified. Officials suspect he was a "sharpshooter hired from somewhere in North-East".
"The demand for rhino horn from Myanmar and some other neighbouring countries is high. In Chitwan National Park of Nepal, too, new cases of rhino poaching have been reported of late. The poaching attempt in Kaziranga was fuelled by this growing international demand," a source said.
