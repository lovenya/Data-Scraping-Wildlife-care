NEW DELHI: Telangana chief minister and TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) has alleged that the BJP is luring 20-30 of his party MLAs with money in an effort to topple the state government.
This comes close on the heels of the Telangana police claiming to have nabbed three people "associated" with the BJP as they were trying to bribe four key TRS MLAs to defect to the saffron party.Top Picks For YouBJP tried to poach four TRS legislators, claim Telangana police
"They have sent brokers to buy each MLA for Rs 100 crore. They wanted to buy 20 or 30 MLAs and topple KCR's government and encroach Telangana so that they can implement privatisation as per their will,” Rao said while addressing a rally in by-poll bound Munugode. 
The BJP and TRS have been at loggerheads, as the saffron party tries to make inroads into the state that goes to polls next year.

TRS sources had claimed that four of its MLAs were offered Rs 100 crore each, apart from contracts running into crores, to cross over. 
The four TRS MLAs allegedly targeted are Guvvala Balaraj from Achampet, Rohith Reddy from Tandur, Kollapur MLA Harshavardhan Reddy and Pinapaka MLA Rega Kantha Rao.
KCR paraded all the four legislators in the public meeting in Munugode on Sunday.
Based on a complaint by Rohith Reddy, cases under relevant sections - criminal conspiracy, offering bribe and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 - were filed against Ramachandra Bharati alias Satish Sharma, Nanda Kumar and Simhayaji Swamy.
BJP, however, has said it has nothing to do with the alleged poaching attempt.
In the last state elections of 2018, TRS won single-majority with 88 seats in the 119-member assembly; BJP could manage just one.
