According to the forest authorities, the staff was put on alert following the rising cases of poaching and smuggling of wild animals. 
Police arrested three people in the district on Saturday for allegedly trying to smuggle two red sand boa snakes for sale from Pune to Moradabad. 
Gyan Singh, sub-divisional forest officer, said, “We have put our staff on alert. All villagers are being appealed to share the information they have about wildlife smuggling. Several cases of smuggling have surfaced in the past in the district.”
The forest team also caught several accused of smuggling fish, turtles, snakes, parakeets, and pangolins in the past four months. Notably, Bijnor district is a wildlife-rich area and attracts poachers. 
According to officials, the special task force of Uttarakhand police seized the skins of five tigers, their jaws, bones, and nails weighing over 125 kg, and arrested one of the poachers belonging to Bavariya gang in March 2016. 
Apart from this, the skins of two tigers were recovered in 2013 from the Badhapur range of the Najibabad division, and two persons were held in the case.
