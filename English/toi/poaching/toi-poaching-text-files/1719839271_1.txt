CHANDIGARH: Haryana farmers can no longer get the licence for their traditional weapon against intrusive wild animals. More than 18 months after the poachers shot a wildlife guard, the Haryana government has banned single-barrel muzzle gun (SBMG) — which had become the hunters’ favourite firearm.
Called “gandhak potash bandook” or “topa gun” in local parlance, this firearm is loaded with low-grade explosives, mainly potassium chlorate and sulphur combined with small steel balls.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAdditional chief secretary for home T V S N Prasad on Wednesday told the district magistrates and police commissioners to cancel its licences and start seizing the weapons.
On December 16, 2021, some poachers had shot wildlife guard Suresh Kumar upon being stopped from hunting inside the Fatehabad forest reserve. The wildlife and home departments claim that while poaching hasn’t stopped, banning the weapon can reduce it to an extent. Kumar’s autopsy confirmed the use of SBMZ, by the traces of typical explosive and fragments of steel-ball pellets inside the body. 
The government had to expedite the banning process because wildlife activist Vinod Kadwasra had sought the action-taken report about the Fatehabad incident. Officials claimed that since these guns were local made without serial number or other details, it was difficult to track their owners. On how farmers will defend their crops from stray boars and nilgais, the officials said they had moved on to newer methods such as local-made crackers, while these guns were now more in the hands of poachers.
