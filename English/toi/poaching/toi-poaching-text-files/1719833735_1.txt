Guwahati: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lauded the Assam government’s relentless efforts in preventing poaching of one-horned rhinos during his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat.
Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, while thanking the PM for his appreciation, said the state government shall ensure complete elimination of rhino poaching.
Modi said, “The rhinoceros, which has such great glory in the culture of Assam, had to face difficulties.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAs many as 37 rhinos in 2013 and 32 in 2014 were killed by poachers. To tackle this challenge, a huge campaign against the poaching of rhinoceros was launched in the last seven years with the special efforts of the Assam government.”
He added that burning more than 2,400 rhino horns seized from poachers on World Rhino Day last year was a stern message to the poachers. “The result of such efforts is that now there is a steady decrease in the hunting of rhinos in the state. Whereas 37 rhinos were killed in 2013, two killings in 2020 and only one last year have come to the fore. I appreciate the resolve of the people of Assam to save the rhinoceros,” Modi said.
