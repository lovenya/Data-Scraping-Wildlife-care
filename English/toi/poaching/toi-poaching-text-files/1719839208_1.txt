BHOPAL: Five employees of the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) in Madhya Pradesh have been booked by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) team from Delhi and the state wildlife's Special Task Force (STF) for their alleged involvement in the clandestine burning of a dead wild elephant. 
The suspects not only buried the charred skeletal remains in six deep pits within the reserve but also ground the remaining fragments into minuscule particles along with ashes and dispersed them throughout the Son River in an apparent attempt to eradicate any trace of their crime.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo

It took several hours for the investigating team to locate pits and collect evidences. They are also trying to confirm if the elephant had a tusk. 
State chief wildlife warden J S Chouhan, when contacted, assured that the investigations are in progress and those found guilty will face consequences.
The incident, which occurred in November 2022, came to light in January 2023 when an inquiry was initiated by the Union Environment Ministry following a complaint lodged by wildlife activist Ajay Dubey from Bhopal. Dubey alleged that a wild elephant was poached, and its carcass was burned in the buffer zone of the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Shahdol district.
Accompanying his complaint, Dubey submitted photographs on January 11, claiming to have received credible information from local sources about the incident occurring near Chhatwa village, which falls within BTR’s Panpatha buffer zone.
Officials suspect that the burnt elephant may be the one that was treated and released in the forest after being found unconscious in the Panpatha range in October 2022.
Samples have been sent for forensic analysis to determine the cause of death. Authorities are also perplexed as to why the forest employees resorted to burning the carcass and attempting to destroy the evidence.
During initial interrogations, the employees claimed to have acted out of fear of retribution from higher authorities. However, officers remain unsatisfied with their explanations.
Notably, wild elephants have been responsible for the deaths of nearly 12 individuals in Madhya Pradesh over the past five years, with eight fatalities occurring in the three districts surrounding the Sanjay Tiger Reserve. These immigrant tuskers have been primarily sustaining themselves on cultivated crops while exhibiting behaviour, such as house-breaking for stored grain, salt, and possibly liquor, passed down through generations.
A report from the government's core committee on mitigating Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) after extensive field investigations has made several recommendations to address the situation. The experts suggest considering the formation of a new Elephant Reserve under Project Elephant, comprising the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve and the Sanjay Tiger Reserve, along with their adjoining buffers and connecting corridors, for effective long-term management. They emphasize the need for allocated resources, staffing, and senior officials to oversee the reserve's operations.
Additionally, the report recommends the formulation of state-level guidelines for elephant conservation and mitigation of human-elephant conflicts. It urges urgent consideration of a policy facilitating immediate payment of ex-gratia towards human-elephant conflicts. The experts propose entering a regime of adaptive management of the state's elephant population, taking into account the success or failure of conflict mitigation measures, continued immigration of elephants, and the viability of maintaining demographically stable populations with manageable levels of conflicts.
