“The incident happened at a forest near the Bori village in the Indapur tehsil. Our patrolmen found some flashlights in the dark around 11.30pm on Tuesday. We chased those lights and found the two men with the gunny sack that contained the chinkara carcass. We arrested them and filed a case under the relevant laws, and seized the rifle and rounds, and the motorcycle,” Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests (Pune division), told TOI.
Chinkaras have been often hunted as trophy and for venison. Forest department officials said the species is listed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, due to an alarming reduction in its population over the years in Indian forests. It is also listed as a species with a declining population under the Red List of the IUCN.
