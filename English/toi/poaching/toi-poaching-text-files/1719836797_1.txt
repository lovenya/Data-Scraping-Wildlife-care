Coimbatore: The forest department on Sunday arrested five people for attempting to poach wild boars near Sethumadai in Pollachi forest division of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR). Officials have seized a double-barrelled breech-loader gun, sickle and knives from them.
A forest officer said they nabbed P Mohanram, 44, of Coimbatore, J Balasubramanian, 41, of Kinathukadavu, S Rajkumar, 49, of Singanallur, S Sathish, 40, of Thottipalayam and M Sathish Kumar, 29, of Jothi Nagar near Aliyar in Pollachi, based on a tip from farm worker Ganesh, of Panapallam area.
“Ganesh heard gunshot sound twice around 3am on Sunday and informed forest guard Anandaraj. Immediately, the frontline staff with the Pollachi forest range rushed to the spot and stopped a car alongside of a contour canal. There were five passengers inside. The frontline staff checked the car and found the gun, five live rounds, four knives and a sickle. When questioned, the five replied that they were there to consume alcohol,” the officer said. 
During further inquiry, he said, some of them gave contradictory statements. “The frontline staff took them to the place from where they said to have consumed alcohol and found two cases of used rounds. The five later confessed that they reached the reserve forest around 11pm on Saturday and attempted to poach wild boars after consuming liquor. While Mohanram and Balasubramanian shot at wild boars, they missed the targets.” 
Pollachi forest range officer V Pugalendhi has registered a case against the five under the Wildlife Protection Act and arrested them. They were produced before a judicial magistrate court and remanded in judicial custody. tnn
