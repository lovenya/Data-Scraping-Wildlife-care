BHOPAL: A tigress’s mutilated carcass was found floating in a river in the buffer zone of Pench National Park on Saturday — the very day all six parks and reserves of Madhya Pradesh opened for tourists after three months of monsoon shutdown.
Its claws were missing, triggering concern that it was poached for occult practices where self-styled tantriks claim to be able to “rain money from the sky” by performing black magic on tiger or leopard body parts like paws, claws and whiskers.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoVillagers easily get taken in, and such occult practices have long been a threat to tiger conservation in the region.
It was local fishermen who saw the carcass between Badal Par and Laonar Pindarai regions and called forest officials at Pench around 8 am on Saturday. Foresters said the tigress seemed to be two-three years old.
Teams have been set up to investigate how the tigress died, and if it was poached for the claws or if villagers hacked off the claws after finding the carcass. Officials suspect it was electrocuted. Some locals use live electric wires to fish and others to keep wild boars and other animals away from their farms. Both of these pose a threat to tigers and leopards.
