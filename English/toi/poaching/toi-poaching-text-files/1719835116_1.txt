Kolkata: Two persons were given five years’ imprisonment for hunting a pangolin at north Bengal’s Jaldapara National Park in September last year. The verdict was pronounced by the court of the ACJM, Alipurduar on January 27.
A senior forester said the case was fast-tracked and all proceedings, from arrest to conviction and pronouncement of judgment, were completed in less than four-and-a-half months.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
On September 15, 2021, Rashidul Haque and Anisur Rahaman entered the national park from Jalgaon with arms. A search was launched inside the forest and raids were conducted in several places, leading to the duo’s arrest. 
“A case (no. 654/21) was started before the court of the ACJM, Alipurduar. The accused were taken into forest custody and, during interrogation, they accepted that they had hunted the pangolin, which is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red list and is a Schedule I animal under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Subsequently, pangolin skin and scales were recovered from them,” said the forester.
A prayer for custodial trial was submitted to the court, along with the chargesheet. Evidence was provided in the form of wildlife DNA forensics.
