HYDERABAD: Even as BJP state office-bearers met here on Saturday to discuss the party strategy for the ensuing GHMC polls, the party is wary about ‘operation akarsh’ by the ruling TRS and how to protect its cadre and leaders.
BJP has already suffered a blow with its spokesperson Sridhar Reddy joining the TRS. Sridhar said many others from the BJP would join the TRS before the civic body elections.
During the recent Dubbak by-election, finance minister T Harish Rao ensured that several grassroots workers and leaders joined the TRS.The BJP is worried that the TRS would try to poach its city-level leaders before the GHMC polls.
While this is so, the BJP is not keeping quiet either. It is also trying to cajole disgruntled leaders and activists from the TRS to jump over to its side. Former mayor Teegala Krishna Reddy is all set to join the BJP, while sitting TRS corporator T Srinivas Reddy joined the BJP on Friday. “The TRS has failed to implement the manifesto released in 2016 election,” he said. 
BJP during the 2016 GHMC elections was in alliance with TDP and won only four wards. The party is aiming to bag 80 wards this time.
