CHANDIGARH: Fearing ‘poaching’ by rivals ahead of the mayoral elections scheduled on January 17, all three major political parties have moved their councillors out of the city, taking them to states under their governance owing to a “favourable and cordial atmosphere”.
The AAP councillors have gone to Punjab, BJP’s to Haryana and those of the Congress to Himachal Pradesh, where the party recently wrested power from the BJP.
The Congress councillors are currently staying in Kasauli. They will later go to Shimla. AAP councillors are in Ropar and Anandpur Sahib, while those of the BJP in Morni. The party has made all the arrangements of their stay till Monday. They will arrive straight on Tuesday, the day of the polling.
The fight is close between the ruling BJP and opposition AAP. Sources said all the three political parties are worried about horse trading and adoption of other means to make councillors shift their loyalty. The nominations were filed on January 12, four days before the polling.

By adding the MP’s lone vote, the saffron party’s tally touches 15. Even the shifting of one councillor can swing the election. 
The Congress has merely six councillors. Although none of its members filed the nomination papers, any kind of involvement from them could change the scenario,” sources said.
