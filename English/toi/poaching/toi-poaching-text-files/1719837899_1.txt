Kolkata: CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged inside the assembly that BJP had tried to break her family and “scare and allure” one of her brothers and his wife into joining the party.
“But they did not go. Ora jane Didi chamkay, Didi dhamkay, abar bhalobashe, dekheo rakhe (They know Didi may scold them but they also know that she is loving and caring),” Banerjee told the assembly.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoShe did not specify when BJP was working on her family. But Trinamool sen-iors close to her said it was just before the 2021 assembly polls, when some BJP seniors started threatening that the “lotus would bloom in Kalighat” in a veiled reference to Banerjee’s Kalighat home.
Banerjee, while speaking during the debate on the governor’s budget session-opening speech, also brought up the Amartya Sen-versus-Visva-Bharati row to launch a frontal attack on the BJP. “It is unfortunate that you (BJP) do not even spare a personality like Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. I would have placed the land deed at his feet. Whatever Amartya Sen is saying is 100% correct,” she said, before adding: “Tagore is not alive now. They would not have spared him either.” The V-B management has claimed Sen encroached on 0.13 acres of land.
