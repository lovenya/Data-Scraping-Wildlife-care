COIMBATORE: Six people have been arrested for poaching a wild boar in the Periyanaickenapalayam forest range in the district. Forest department officials have seized 30KG meat from them and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on each of the accused.
A forest officer said they came across P Rangasamy, 68, P Manikandan, 19, R Selvam, 38, P Sakthivel, 21 and M Velusamy, 44, residents of Palakkad district in Kerala, and C Senthilkumar, 36, a resident of Pannimadai in Coimbatore, while they were patrolling the forest area along with the special task force of the police department on Sunday.
“Rangasamy and Manikandan were cleaning the meat in a stream. We surrounded them and caught them. They said four others were also involved and they were chopping the meat some distance away. When we attempted to catch them, the four left the meat and knife at the spot and escaped,” the officer said. 
The forest officers arrested the four at Kottathurai in Palakkad district on Monday. Preliminary investigation revealed that the accused had entered the Periyanaickenapalayam forest range and hunted down the wild boar to sell a portion of the meat.
“We have booked them under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and slapped a penalty of Rs 10,000 on each of them,” the officer said.
