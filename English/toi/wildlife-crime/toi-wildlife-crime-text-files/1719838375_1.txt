MUMBAI: A Thane resident has been arrested for allegedly killing a monitor lizard and consuming its meat. The accused, Vicky Ganpat Lad (41), is in the custody of the forest department. The monitor lizard is protected under the Wildlife Act, and hunting or killing it is a crime.
Around 2am on Friday, forest officials landed up at Lad's home at Patlipada on getting information about the killing of the monitor lizard.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHis home is perched on a hillock which has a thicket of vegetation in the backyard. The lizard had initially entered a neighbour's house on Thursday evening. Its presence created a flutter in the locality. Someone in the area alerted the forest department's helpline (1926) about the sighting of the reptile. Lad, who claims to be a snake rescuer, scooped up the lizard and took it away, said Rohit Mohite, honorary wildlife warden for Thane district.
Officials from the forest department's vigilance squad from Thane reached the spot with Thane police around 2am. "We found cooked meat of the monitor lizard in the fridge of his house," said Vinod Dhurve, range forest officer (vigilance).
Sources said they suspect this was a part of the flesh and Lad had possibly consumed some of it. A case has been registered.
According to Mohite, snake rescuers often do not follow guidelines while rescuing wildlife. He further said that many of them even fail to intimate the forest department of rescues, although it is mandatory to do so.
