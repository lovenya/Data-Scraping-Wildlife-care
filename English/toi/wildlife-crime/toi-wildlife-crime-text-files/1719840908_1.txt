DEHRADUN: Experts from Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) cell of the forest ministry, who were in Ramnagar on Tuesday, laid emphasis on exposing the frontline forest staff to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the Indian Evidence Act, to ensure that criminals involved in wildlife crimes are convicted at the court hearings.
 Several wildlife experts expressed their views at the two-day conference held in collaboration with forest department and Corbett Foundation, on enhancing legal insight and requisite provisions for successful prosecution. 
One of the sessions was on the proper use of intelligence, intelligence collection methods, agent/source running, by DS Rathore, inspector of WCCB, followed by a question-and-answer session. Another session on 'Search and Seizure' was conducted by wildlife inspector of WCCB, Arnab Basu. According to experts, most of the criminals are acquitted, owing to poor evidence or shoddy representation of the case by all those involved, including the frontline forest staff. The legal aspect and various sections related to wildlife crimes were elaborated by senior officer Bhagwati Prasad Joshi of the Uttarakhand forest department.
