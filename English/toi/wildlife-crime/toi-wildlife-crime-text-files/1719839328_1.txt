MUMBAI: Fort resident, Pradeep D’souza, who had been arrested by forest officials for keeping several wildlife protected bird species inside his house, has been released on bail by a local court. His advocate produced correspondence that D’souza had sent to the forest department in 2020, stating that he was taking care of many injured and ailing birds and animal species, and so did not hide this fact from the authorities.
“The letter my client, Pradeep, had written to the conservator of forests (Thane) in March 2020 had given all details on how wildlife bird species like kites, barn owls, egrets and even bats were kept in his house.However, the forest authorities did not act on it then. The court acknowledged the letter and since the investigating officer did not raise any objection to the bail, he was granted bail,” said advocate Siddh Vidya.
Last week, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and forest officials jointly raided D’souza’s house and seized scheduled species like kites, parrots, barn owls, and bats among others while also arresting him under the Wildlife (Protection) Action, 1972.
Honorary wildlife warden Sunish Subramanian said: “Legally speaking, it is wrong to keep protected bird species as they should be handed over to the authorities or professionals who can give them proper treatment.”
