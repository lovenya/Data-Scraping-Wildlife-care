MUMBAI: The carcasses of two marine mammals were found beached along the city's shoreline on Sunday. While a fully grown Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin, at least eight feet in length, was found in a patch of mangroves at Carter Road in Bandra, a 4-foot-long porpoise washed up at Aksa beach in Malad. The dolphin could have been dead in the sea waters a few days back, said Ankit Vyas, volunteer for Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Range forest officer Prashant Deshmukh confirmed the two mammal deaths. “The dolphin's carcass had been briefly sighted off Juhu during high tide on Friday . By the time our team got to the spot, it was pushed back into the sea due to high tide,“ he said. “It resurfaced at Bandra on Sunday .“
Researcher on marine mammals, Mihir Sule, said it would be difficult to surmise the cause of deaths merely by observing a carcass. “Decomposition takes away vital facts. One cannot say whether the cause of death is natural or human-induced.“
