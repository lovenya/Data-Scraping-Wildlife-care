Speaking with TOI on Sunday, Yadav Tarte Patil, one of the expert members on the panel, said effective check on different types of wildlife crime in Marathwada and other parts of the state would be one of the key agendas. 
“Wildlife crime involves poaching and illegal trading and infringement on the rights of wild animals at large. These types of crime often go unchecked due to lack of effective mechanism. A special cell at every district level to keep vigil on such crimes will be proposed,” he said.

A section of political leaders support such claims due to vote-bank politics. The issue will be brought to the notice of MSWB for effective remedy,” he said.
