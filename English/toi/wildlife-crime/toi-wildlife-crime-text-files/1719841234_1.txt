CHENNAI: With illegal trade on sand boa 'mannoli pambu' resurfacing in the state, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) sleuths have intensified checks along districts bordering Andhra Pradesh.
M Kirupasankar, Deputy Director of WCCB, said the trade on this non-venomous reptile is slowly reemerging. According to intelligence gathered by the bureau, the trade on sand boas is taking place in Vellore, Tiruvallur and Tiruvannamalai districts.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo

Recently, state WCCB officials received a tip-off about sand boas kept for sale at Sholingur in Vellore. So, a team, who posed as potential traders, reached out to the person, who claimed to have a boa in his possession.
Once this team agreed to pay 25 lakh, they were taken to a nearby village in a separate vehicle. But somehow the news got leaked and the smugglers fled the spot before the team could reach.
However, in another incident reported last month, state WCCB seized sand boas, which were kept in boiling water to make some traditional medicines. They stumbled upon boas while they went in search of a Coimbatore-based person having tiger skin.
This snake is widely trafficked in international black markets at a heavy price because of the myths surrounding them. They are used by those indulging in black magic, and some people believe that keeping them at home will bring them luck. 
However, none of the beliefs surrounding the sand boas is true, said WCCB officials, who have planned to join hands with local police to intensify checks on all inter-state borders.
