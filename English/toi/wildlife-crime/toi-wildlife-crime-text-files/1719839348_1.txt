Chennai: In an attempt to strengthen the fight against wildlife crimes, the Tamil Nadu forest department will soon be establishing six sniffer dog units at an estimated cost of 74 lakh. 
Of the six units, two will be set up only with native breeds of Tamil Nadu like Chippiparai or Kombai.
Though some of the forest divisions are already equipped with sniffer dogs, the government has now ensured that such squads are available for forest officers across the state.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The government will purchase puppies, construct kennels, groom and vaccinate them. They will be trained by experts to sniff animal bones, skins, ivory and red sanders at critical forest areas in Chennai region, western and southern Tamil Nadu. Besides this, it will build a customised vehicle, so that the squads can be mobilised soon to the crime scenes. A senior official from the forest department said that the chances of tracking down the suspects is higher if sniffer dogs can reach the crime scene within 24 hours.

Sniffer dogs will come in handy in such situations as they can easily detect hidden animal meat, skin or any such articles related to wildlife crimes or illegal trade," the official added. Tamil Nadu has a wildlife conviction rate of less than 3% because of lack of supporting evidence. This move is aimed at tightening the conviction nose.
Welcoming this, C K Sreedharan, former principal chief conservator of forests said that well-trained sniffer squads are an effective option to detect wildlife crimes, but they should be used with a lot of discretion.
