On the occasion, Special DG (crime branch) B K Sharma stressed on the significant role that the police needs to play in combating wildlife crimes. "We have successfully cracked some wildlife cases in last few years, including arrest of notorious poacher Afzal Baig. Police officers have to work in tandem with forest officials to ensure implementation of wildlife laws," said Sharma. Sharma also highlighted that the Crime Branch has plans to strengthen the wildlife cell, which was set up last year. "We are preparing a database on wildlife poachers, who is active in the state.
Besides, there is plan to add more young and energetic manpower to the dedicated wildlife cell," added Sharma. At present, the wildlife cell, functioning under the Crime Branch, has seven staff members. Plans are there to increase the staff strength to 15. The workshop, organised to sensitize and train the officers of police stations that lie within or nearby sanctuaries to curb the illegal poaching and wildlife trade, was also attended by state principal chief conservator of forest Siddhanta Das.
