Chatterjee’s counsel Sk Habib Uddin said they are yet to visit the officers and will only be able to give a clear picture once they meet them. “We will meet the officers soon to know the exact allegations,” said the counsel.
Chatterjee was a BJP candidate from Behala west, who was fielded against Partha Chatterjee for the 2021 assembly elections. After her loss, she quit her affiliation with the party. Over the last few weeks, she was spotted campaigning for several Trinamool Congress candidates for the municipality polls across Bengal.
“It is not only a crime to capture scheduled and protected wild animals but a public personality like her indulging in such act can also influence others to commit the mistake. She should cooperate with us in the investigation and help us in our fight against the protection of wildlife,” said a senior forest department official.
