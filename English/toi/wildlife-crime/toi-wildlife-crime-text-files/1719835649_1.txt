NAGPUR: Five days after the Mukutban tigress was found choked to death and her body parts removed, a joint team of police and forest department arrested two persons from Pandharwani village on Friday and seized a paw and nail from them.
The four-year-old pregnant tigress was brutally killed in a cave in Mangurla and her two front paws were chopped. The incident came to light on April 25.As the crime was complicated, Yavatmal CCF SV Ramarao sought help from SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal.
Even as the forest department registered offences under Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, the police played a key role in nabbing the accused. Bhujbal and Ramarao had visited the spot on April 28 along with other police officials. 
The SP constituted four teams. Police informers found links of the case to Pandharwani (Dubhati) village. According to Ramarao, the accused were nabbed after decoy customers were sent to them to buy nails and paws. The accused have been identified as father-son duo Ashok Letu Atram (20) and Letu Rama Atram (45), both Pandharwani.
Bhujbal said, “It was a complicated case as the tigress was killed somewhere on April 20 and there was evidence on the spot. Our officers used their experience to nab the accused. We have to seize nine more nails and another paw. More accused are involved and teams are on the job to nab them,” said Ramarao.
The SP said more details about the case will only be revealed during the interrogation of the accused who will be produced in the court on Saturday for forest custody.
