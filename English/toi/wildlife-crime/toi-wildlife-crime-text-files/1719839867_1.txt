Kolkata: Actor Srabanti Chatterjee was grilled by officers of the Wildlife Crime Control Cell and Data Management Unit of state forest department in Salt Lake on Tuesday — for the second day in a row — following a notice issued against her for allegedly shooting with a chained mongoose, which TOI had reported on February 26.
Chatterjee has been booked under sections 9, 11, 39, 48A, 49 and 49A of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. If proven guilty, she can be jailed for up to seven years.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe notice was sent to her on February 15. However, she skipped two dates before appearing on Monday, when she allegedly told the officers that the mongoose belonged to a driver. She was asked to reappear on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Chatterjee, along with her driver, make-up artist, shoot coordinator, photographer and three others appeared before the officers again.
“We are yet to get whereabouts of the animal and until we get that, we will continue to question the accused,” said a forest official.
