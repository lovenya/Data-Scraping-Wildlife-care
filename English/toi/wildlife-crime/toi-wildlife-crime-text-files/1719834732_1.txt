COIMBATORE: Three men were arrested on Thursday for stealing two tusks from the skeletal remains of a wild tusker in the Boluvampatti forest range with an intension to sell them.
A forest officer identified the accused as 50-year-old K Thambi alias Raman, 27-year-old V Maruthupandi and 50-year-old V Chinnan, all residents of Thanikandi tribal settlement.
The officer said the frontline staff of the forest department had stumbled upon the skeletal remains of the tusker, which had died some 40 days ago, during a routine patrol at Poondi south forest beat on October 23.“The tusks were missing from the skeletal remains. We subsequently registered a case under the Wildlife Protection Act and launched a perambulation in the reserve forest area.” The officer said they had recovered the stolen tusks, which were hidden amidst the bushes some 430 metres away from the place from where the skeletal remains of the tusker were found, on October 28.
