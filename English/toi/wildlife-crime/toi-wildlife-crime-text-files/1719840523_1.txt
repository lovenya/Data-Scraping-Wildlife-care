Divisional forest officer (DFO) Rajkumar Sah said, “The three accused were sent to the judicial custody on the basis of the FIR lodged against them under the Wildlife Protection Act. The turtles have been released in the Ganga river at Sultanganj, following an order of the court of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Deoghar. The turtles were of the Indian soft shell turtle variety, which are classified as Schedule I animal under the law that prohibits the hunt and capture of the species.”
“The value of turtles is very high in the international market. People also keep turtles as pets as it is believed that they bring ‘good luck’ for the residents of that household,” he stated.
The photographs of the turtles and the arrested persons were sent to the Wildlife Crime Control Board for further probe. “It is suspected that the trio might have been heading towards the Deoghar airport to deliver the turtles to someone for smuggling on a scheduled Deoghar-Delhi flight,” the DFO opined.
