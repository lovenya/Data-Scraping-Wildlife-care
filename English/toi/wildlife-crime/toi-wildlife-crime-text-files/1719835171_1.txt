MUMBAI: A dead Olive Ridley turtle was found beached at Aksa on Monday morning. A lifeguard deployed at the beach spotted the turtle. 
“The carcass was in a decomposed state. Kites that were circling over had pecked at the dead turtle and dogs had nibbled its innards,” said Ankit Vyas, a volunteer with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. 
Additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell) N Vasudevan confirmed that an Olive Ridley had been found at the beach.
