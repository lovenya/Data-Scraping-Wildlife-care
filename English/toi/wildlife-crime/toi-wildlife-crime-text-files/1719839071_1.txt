RUDRAPUR: A day after carcasses of over a dozen monkeys were found in a mango orchard at Bazpur Road in Kashipur, Udham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand — and the police detained seven persons involved in the maintenance of the orchard, suspecting their involvement in the suspicious deaths of the simians — police arrested two orchard contractors on Monday. 
All nine accused — identified as Jaan Muhammad and Imamuddin, the orchard contractors and their employees Chhote Khan, Imran, Afzal, Anwar, Iqrar Shah, Nadeem, and Mubarak — were found to be residents of Bareilly district in Uttar Pradesh, and have been sent to jail on charges of poisoning, leading to the death of the monkeys. 
The incident came to light on Sunday evening when local villagers came to the orchard to cut grass for their animals and discovered a baby monkey clutching its dead mother, surrounded by other dead simians. Police then recovered the carcasses concealed in the orchard's bushes and some even buried in the ground. 
During questioning, the accused confessed that they resorted to poisoning the monkeys as they were concerned about the damage they would cause to the fruits in the orchard. Following their confession, police booked the accused under Section 295A (malicious intention of outraging religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code, as well as Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused were produced before the court and later sent to jail.
