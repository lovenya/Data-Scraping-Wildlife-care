Bhubaneswar: Presence of Maoists in wildlife sanctuaries in the state is not new. But their role to impede protection has come as a surprise to the wildlife wing.
According to sources, the Maoist were threatening forest personnel not to implicate villagers for their role in laying electric trap to prevent elephants from straying into their paddy fields.The rebels say the villagers have the right to protect their paddy fields from the attack of herds of elephants, and the frest department cannot prosecute anyone if elephants are electrocuted in the process.
Almost a month ago, a guard in Satkosia tiger reserve was allegedly assaulted by the Maoists for naming villagers indulged in wildlife crime.
This facet of the extremists has come at a time when elephants across the state were facing deaths due to deliberate electrocution. Between January and June this year, the state has recorded deaths of 16 elephants. On Saturday, a tusker died of electrocution in Dhenkanal district.
