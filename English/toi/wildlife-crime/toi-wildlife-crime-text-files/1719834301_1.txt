“Incidents of poachers laying snares to hunt wild animals are on the rise in the state. The big cat was also a victim of such a crime and the accused managed to escape from the law as such incidents occur in remote areas rarely frequented by people,” Jadhav said. He said the leopard was trapped in a cable snare that was laid over a rack of laterite stones behind a house at Kerwada, Usgao.
“We rescued it using a tranquiliser dart.She is out of danger,” Jadhav said. Range forest officers Vilas Gawas and Siddhesh Naik, range forester Prajyot Naik, forest guards Devu Shetkar, Sachin Sawant, Rajan Gaonkar, Rama Devgunkar, Pramod Malik, Surandra Gaonkar and animal rescuer Ali Shaikh were part of the rescue operation.
