PILIBHIT: After a gap of two years, Pilibhit administration is planning to revive the turtle rescue centre project, proposed to be set up near Phulhar lake at Madhotanda village.
The project was proposed in November 2018 by a US-based international organization, Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA), after Pilibhit-Kheri region was identified as one of the five-most sensitive areas in UP vulnerable to turtle poaching and illicit trading by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB).

Pilibhit is home to 12 turtle species, including six enlisted in schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Phulhar lake has sizable population of the Indian soft shell turtles, one of the schedule I species.
