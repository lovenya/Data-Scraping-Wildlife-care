Ambergris, a banned wildlife product in the country, is a solid waxy substance produced in the gut of the sperm whale. It has a huge commercial value in the perfume market since the perfume makers use it as a fixative to endure the fragrance longer. 
Forest officials also seized two motorcycles from the accused. All five accused, including one from Kerala, were produced before Srivilliputhur District Magistrate Court 2 and were remanded into judicial custody. Further investigation is underway, according to the forest department. TNN
