The samples of the seized Ambergris were sent to marine biologists for examination. 
"A case was registered against the three persons under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and they were arrested," he said, adding "further investigation is underway."
The sale of Ambergris, which is used to make perfume, is prohibited by law as the sperm whale is an endangered species that is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act.
