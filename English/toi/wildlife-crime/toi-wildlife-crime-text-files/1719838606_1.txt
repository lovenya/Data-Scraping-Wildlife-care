MUMBAI: A team of state forest department has arrested a 72-year-old man from Malad (west) for possessing 117 dried skins of endangered monitor lizard species, which he poached from forest. The skins were illegally used to make a percussion instrument called 'ghumot'.
Range forest officer, Mumbai, Rakesh Bhoir, said, "Under the guidance of deputy conservator of forests (DCF-Thane) Santosh Saste and ACF Girija Desai, we got specific input about 72-year-old Bhagwan Mandalkar, a resident of Kumbhar Wada in Malad, possessing several monitor lizard skins which were used to make drum-like musical instrument called ghumot.Our team raided his house, seized all the skins, and nabbed the accused."
The accused was booked under various sections of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, since monitor lizards are a protected species, informed Bhoir. 
The accused confessed before the raiding team that he had been regularly sourcing skins of monitor lizards by poaching them in forest areas of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, and using them to make ghumot. Ghumot is also a known traditional percussion instrument in Goa, but using monitor lizard skin for its making is illegal. Many now use goat skin or even synthetic rubber.
