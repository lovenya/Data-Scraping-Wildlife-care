NAGPUR: The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), a statutory multi-disciplinary body established under the ministry of environment, forests & climate change (MoEFCC) to combat organized wildlife crime in the country, has initiated online campaign to create awareness against illegal trade.
The WCCB drive, being conducted with the help of OLX, marks wildlife week celebrations that started from October 1.“We will reach out to a large number of daily visitors over OLX. The campaign will be aired online and through mobile app of OLX from Monday,” said Vivek Kishore, joint director, WCCB. tnn
Kishore said the step has been initiated to create awareness about illegal wildlife trade through e-commerce platforms. This effort is one of its kind in the world where WCCB has tapped the potential of e-commerce portals to generate awareness and deter wildlife traders using online media for such trade.
This is for the first time that WCCB has involved e-commerce industries for combating wildlife crime in the country. Last year too, WCCB joined hands with major e-business firms like Amazon, Quikr, Indiamart, and Snapdeal to discuss modalities in curbing illegal wildlife trade through online portals.
Illegal wildlife e-trade was taking on India in a big way. WCCB has no sniffer dogs at parcel venues. Even though accused are caught for animal smuggling, no action is taken against them and they are left to self-regulation.
