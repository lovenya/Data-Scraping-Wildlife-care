Bokaro: The team of the Giridih eastern forest division has busted a gang of pangolin smugglers while they were trying to sell pangolin meat and scales. Three of the smugglers were arrested along with parts of the protected wildlife on Friday.
Acting on a tip-off from the wildlife crime control bureau on Friday that plans are being made to kill a pangolin and sell its meat and scales, divisional forest officer Pravesh Agarwal formed a special team led by forest ranger Sanjay Kumar Ravi.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe team arrested the smugglers identified as Sajan Kumar of Dumri, Bhim Mallah of Palganj and Shamshul Ansari, a resident of Pordag under the Nimiaghat police station area.
Ravi said the team posed as customers and nabbed the smugglers. He also said the pangolin seemed to be caught by the three accused from the Madhuban forest area. “Further investigation is on to nab others in the nexus. We are also working to find out for how long wildlife smuggling is going on in the area.”
A forester said pangolins were poached primarily for meat and scales. Pangolins are believed to be the world’s most trafficked mammal, accounting for as much as 20% of the total illegal wildlife trade. This animal is in high demand across the globe, mostly in Asia, where the scales are considered to have medicinal value and the meat a delicacy.
