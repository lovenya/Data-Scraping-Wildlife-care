NEW DELHI: A wildlife NGO has moved the Supreme Court seeking a high-level investigation into Chinese being hand-in-glove with poaching mafia leading to killing of wild animals in Indian forests to meet the demand for their meat and body parts and also into unauthorised use of rifles, imported for sporting activities, for hunting animals in the name of crop protection.
The NGO, through Sangeeta Dogra, cited many instances of killing of tigers in different reserves by hunters after the animal has been wrongly or deliberately branded as 'man-eater'.She alleged that in many cases there is no record of the carcass of the dead tiger being burnt and rised a suspicion that it could be a conspiratorial killing to cater the demand for tigers' body parts in China and other countries.
She alleged that China and Pakistan were encouraging the poaching mafia with supplies of arms and ammunition to clandestinely kill wild animals and said that this could lead to another virus attack which is prevalent in the animal world unknown to humans.
Dogra said that displaying trophies at homes has been quite common with the erstwhile royals and nawabs and alleged that this was encouraging their scions to illegally indulge in the sport of hunting and posting pictures in social media to boast about their bravery. "The animal trophies at every house should be destroyed," she said and pleaded for a direction in this regard from the SC.

She requested the SC to formulate a guideline and issue direction for its strict implementation to prohibit the "organised crime of trophy hunting and misuse of weapon licenses issued for the purpose of crop protection and sporting activities". She asked, "Whether sports category firearms could be used for hunting wild animals in the name of preventing human-animal conflict?"
