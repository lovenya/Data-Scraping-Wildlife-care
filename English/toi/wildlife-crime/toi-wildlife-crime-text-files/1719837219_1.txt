TRICHY: Close to 50 of 316 parakeets have died in the last 24 hours in an enclosure where the birds were recuperating after their seizure from traffickers last Thursday in Trichy. In all, 48 birds have died, 32 on Monday and 16 on Tuesday, according to forest officials. 
Over 400 parakeets were originally seized by the wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB) from Palakkarai in Trichy. But only 316 survived by the time they were shifted by the forest department to the facility owned by the animal husbandry department.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Two days after their rescue, when forest department decided to shift them to a large enclosure, over 70 birds had already died. 
Although the local forest department should have carried out the operation, WCCB busted the big racket operating right under the forest department’s nose, which came as an embarrassment for local forest officials. This is perhaps one of the reasons why there was a delay in rehabilitating the birds by forest department.

Sharavan Krishnan, an animal rehabilitator from Chennai said, “More than the rescue, rehabilitation of wildlife matters the most and there’s a lot more to be done.” 
Chances of cross infection is more when large number of birds are kept in close confinement and keeping them in small groups of 4-5 is ideal for better recuperation.
