NAINITAL: Pulling up the central government over the non-formation of a state wildlife crime control bureau and progress regarding formation of a ‘Special Tiger Protection Force’ in Uttarakhand, the high court (HC) on Thursday sent a notice to the Union ministry of forest, environment and climate change, while hearing a petition filed by Rajiv Mehta, former warden of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, alleging negligence of the state government over protection of tigers.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoMehta told TOI that the court has said that “in case the concerned officials fail to submit satisfactory response before March 17, they will be summoned in the court to explain.”
The PIL was filed after skin of five tigers and around 130 kilograms of tiger bones believed to be of big cats from Corbett Tiger Reserve, were seized from poachers by the Uttarakhand Special Task Force (STF) in March 2016. The petition had requested the court for the formation of a bureau and a CBI inquiry into the matter.
