Bhubaneswar: The special task force (STF) of the Crime Branch has urged the state police to explore the feasibility of opening a special unit to conduct forensic examination of wildlife parts. At present, the STF sends the seized or recovered wildlife parts to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun for forensic examination.
Though the STF’s main mandate is to curb organised crimes and drug trafficking in the state, protection of endangered wildlife species and crackdown against wildlife smugglers has also remained its focus area.“We feel the necessity for establishment of a wildlife forensic unit at the State Forensic Science Laboratory (SFSL) or the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT). Wildlife body parts are being recovered at regular intervals. It costs a lot and takes a long time to send the wildlife crime exhibits to the WII in Dehradun for a forensic test,” an STF officer said. 
The STF has seized at least 22 leopard skins, 12 elephant tusks, 7 deer skins, 15 pangolin scales and rescued 8 pangolins since 2020 till now. Altogether 51 people were arrested during the period for their alleged involvement in the wildlife crimes. 
Experts said there is a need to sensitise enforcement agencies in wildlife crime scene investigation and proper collection of evidence through regular training and workshops. “The government should rope in expert agencies to provide advanced training on wildlife crime analysis. This would help their capacity building to combat wildlife crime,” said R N Sharma, who works in wildlife conservation. 
Recently, chief minister Naveen Patnaik praised the STF for effectively curbing wildlife crimes in the state. Last year, the STF launched a helpline number (9439263646) to receive information on wildlife crimes.
