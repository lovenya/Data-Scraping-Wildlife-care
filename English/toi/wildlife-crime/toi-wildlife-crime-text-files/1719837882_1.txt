AHMEDABAD: The state forest department has launched a state-wide helpline number to encourage public participation in wildlife conservation, and facilitate rescue of wild animals and action against wildlife-related crimes. 
Citizens can give a missed call on or send an SMS or a WhatsApp message to +91 83200 02000 to report wildlife-related crimes or raise a rescue alert. Besides, they also can receive links to apply for cattle-death compensation through this number.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
“This is an unmanned auto reply number. In response, the helpline provides links to a page which has phone numbers of all concerned forest officials like RFO or DCF and wildlife wardens based in all 33 districts,” a senior forest department official said. 
“However, this helpline is only meant for issues related to wild animals and not for pets or stray animals,” the official said.

“The department has an existing helpline exclusively for bird and stray animal rescue. We have upgraded Karuna Animal Helpline keeping in mind the upcoming Uttarayan festival when thousands of birds are at risk of getting injured or killed because of the sharp kite strings. Earlier, people would call 1962 to receive information related to rescue services. Now, it has been made a GIS-enabled service where a person can get all the numbers of forest department-operated rescue centres, NGOs, veterinary doctors and volunteers located in nearby areas,” the official said. Citizens can visit Gujarat Forest Department’s official website to avail of this service.
