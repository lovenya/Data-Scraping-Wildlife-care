Chennai: The state forest department has paid 10 crore as compensation to victims of man-animal conflict since May last year, according to its secretary Supriya Sahu. She was speaking at the inauguration of the Wildlife Week celebrations here on Sunday.
The department had also identified the conflict areas, which included Coimbatore, Mettupalayam, Hosur and the Nilgiris. 
At present, 5 lakh is paid as compensation for loss of human life in man-animal conflict, she said.
In a move aimed at clearing the backlog, district forest officers have been authorised to immediately release the compensation amount to a victim’s family. Delay in paying the compensation upset people living near the sanctuaries and would jeopardise conservation efforts, she added.

It would have offices in four locations -- Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Coimbatore and Vellore. The state bureau will create its own data base on wildlife offenders. It would work in coordination with central agencies, including the Customs to curb the trade in wildlife, she said.
