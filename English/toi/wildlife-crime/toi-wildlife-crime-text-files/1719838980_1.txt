Madurai: The Madras high court on Friday sought a response from the central and state governments on a plea which sought to establish fast track special courts across the state for speedy disposal of cases registered on wildlife crimes.
A division bench of justices M M Sundresh and N Sathish Kumar sought the response while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by C Anand Raj, a resident of Madurai district.
The petitioner stated that the conviction rate in wildlife crime cases are very low and the trials are also being delayed. He stated that an RTI reply revealed that the trials are still pending in cases which were registered even before 10 years.
He stated that he came to know that the National Wildlife Action Plan titled ‘Control of Poaching and Illegal trade in Wildlife’ had also given recommendations to establish fast track special courts/ benches to ensure expeditious trials of wildlife and forest crimes. He stated that establishing such courts would be of great help to prevent poaching activities. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench. tnn
