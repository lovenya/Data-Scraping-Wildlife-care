“The poaching of pangolins is being practised due to some superstitious beliefs and the myth that the animal’s body parts can be used for medicinal purposes. All those who believe in such superstitions or myths should remember that pangolin meat or their body parts do not carry any medicinal value or commercial value,” a senior forest official told TOI. 
The officials further appealed to the general public that they should not fall prey to the said vicious circle of offering money for this animal which ultimately leads to arrest and punishment of innocent villagers who directly or indirectly involve themselves or help the persons that operate these wildlife crime.
