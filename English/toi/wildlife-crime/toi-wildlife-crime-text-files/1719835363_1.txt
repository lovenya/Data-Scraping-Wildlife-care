HYDERABAD: Three persons have been taken into custody after a video of four people carrying a small Indian civet on a two-wheeler went viral on social media. Investigation has revealed that the accused killed and consumed the civet’s meat.
The video, which is believed to have been shot on July 13, came to light after a wildlife activist posted it on Facebook, locating it to be from Nagarjuna Sagar highway in Nalgonda.“The video was shot on Sagar Road between Maal village and Mallepally. The moment we received the video, we forwarded it the forest department officials. We tried to trace the vehicle registration number and learnt it is still registered on the name of the previous owner,” said Mirza Kareem Baig of Forest and Wildlife Protection Society (FAWPS).
Four people are seen in the video, displaying the animal, while the person who was travelling alongside in a car asked them to slow down for a better visual.
“We are on the look out for one more person who was also involved in the crime,” divisional forest officer S Shantharam told STOI.

They are also using the fishing nets to capture birds. We are looking into these issues,” he added.
Under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, the Indian civet is protected under Schedule 2.
