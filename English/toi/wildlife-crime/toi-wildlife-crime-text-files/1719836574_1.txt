“We had posed as potential buyer. He had only asked us to meet in front of the school. As we began bargaining over the price, our men nabbed him and seized the animals from his possession,” said Montu Deb, deputy ranger, WCCB.
“On the face of interrogation, he has admitted to have been sourcing the turtles from Chennai and selling it to aficionados in the city. He is a habitual criminal and was arrested earlier for the same offence. He is an original resident of Jharkhand but lives here at a rented house in Keshtopur,” the officer added.
