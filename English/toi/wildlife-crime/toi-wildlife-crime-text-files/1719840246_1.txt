NEW DELHI: Away from the media glare on politically sensitive money laundering cases, the ED has also begun a crackdown against syndicates involved in environmental crimes, including illegal mining of natural resources and smuggling of wildlife parts. It said it has busted cases which generated ‘proceeds of crime’ to the tune of more than Rs 2,700 crore.
According to a report submitted to the finance ministry earlier this year, the agency said it has taken up probe in 17 cases related to environmental crimes and 42 specifically related towildlife.
The ED has attached overRs 8 crore in proceeds of crime in cases of environmental crimes and Rs 123 crore in wildlife crimes. All these cases are the result of a predicate offence already registered and investigated by other enforcement agencies. However, the emphasis is to track the ‘proceeds of crime’ of such syndicates and attach all properties of accused under the stringent PMLA.
The agency has also started booking syndicates engaged in plundering of natural resources under the money laundering act. This includes illegal mining of coal, sand and other natural resources. There have been cases of illegal logging, wildlife and environment related cases.
