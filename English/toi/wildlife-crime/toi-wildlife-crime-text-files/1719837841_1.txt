BENGALURU: Twenty-two macaws, including a few endangered birds from the parrot family, which were about to be smuggled to Bengaluru via air cargo were rescued at Kolkata airport on Sunday. Two men, who investigators believe are part of a wildlife smuggling syndicate sending birds to Bengaluru for a specific client, were arrested. 
Sources with the Kolkata zonal unit of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) said the duo, Kolkata residents Kamalesh Saha and Sayan Acharya, had crammed the birds into small cages and covered them with thick white cloth to avoid detection by Customs authorities. 
"We received specific information about a gang attempting to smuggle exotic birds from Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport. Our team carried out a search on Sunday and discovered the consignment containing 22 macaws packed in a few iron cages. Following a probe, we nabbed Kamalesh and Sayan," a DRI officer from Kolkata told TOI over phone. 
A thorough investigation revealed the two men had smuggled the macaws from Bangladesh through Bongaon town at the Indo-Bangla border. They are suspected to be part of an international wildlife smuggling gang, which had possibly received an order from a Bengaluru-based buyer for a specific number of macaws, the officer added. 
Investigators suspect the buyer wanted the birds to be displayed in a farm facility. "We are still probing the matter and the men are being questioned. A search is under way to locate the receiver in Bengaluru, who remains unidentified," explained the DRI officer. 
The macaws were rescued in coordination with sleuths of West Bengal's Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and were safely shifted to a facility in Kolkata. Sources said the birds are unhurt.
