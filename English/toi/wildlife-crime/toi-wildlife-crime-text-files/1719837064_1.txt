Bhubaneswar: Wildlife crime continues unabated with the Special Task Force (STF) of the Crime Branch on Friday seizing a leopard skin, an elephant tusk and nearly 2 kg pangolin scales from a man in Deogarh district. The accused was identified as Madan Kumar Jayapura (45), a resident of Deogarh district.
The crackdown came a day after the STF seized two leopard skins from another man in Mayurbhanj district on Thursday. PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
“We acted on a fresh input and raided a place near Telibani on National Highway no. 49 and arrested the accused with the leopard skin, elephant tusk and pangolin scales. Local forest officials assisted us during the raid. The accused appears to be a middleman. We will try to trace the poacher and find out the person, who supplied the wildlife body parts to Jayapura,” an STF officer said.
The STF found a bullet wound on the leopard skin, raising suspicion that the leopard might have been gunned down by a poacher. 
The STF will send the seized wildlife exhibits to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, for chemical examination. 
Though the STF’s main mandate is to curb organized crimes and drug trafficking in the state, protection of the endangered wildlife species and crackdown on wildlife smugglers has also remained its focus area. The STF has seized 25 leopard skins, 13 elephant tusks, seven deer skins, rescued nine pangolins and seized 16 kg pangolin scales since 2020 till now. 
Altogether 55 people were arrested during the period for their alleged involvement in the wildlife crimes.
