COIMBATORE: The forest department arrested an anti-poaching watcher and five others at Pollachi on Tuesday for attempting to sell a pair of tusks. 
After receiving a tip from Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) that tusks were sold at a pet shop in NM Sungam, Pollachi, two teams of the forest department and WCCB officials visited the shop around 8pm on Tuesday, a forest official said. 
Posing as customers from Kerala, officials inquired about tusks.When shopowner P Manikandan feigned ignorance, officials said that they had purchased tusks from him before. When the owner acknowledged the claim, officials requested him to present the tusks to verify their authenticity. As soon as tusks were presented, officials seized them and detained Manikandan, the forest official added. 
On questioning him, Manikandan revealed that tusks were removed from dead elephants by anti-poaching watcher K Samiappan and A Kathavarayan, a sanitary worker at the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve, while they were on patrolling duty. Subsequently, they passed the tusks to Sikkandar, a resident of Angalakurichi, who kept it in a farm house with aid of one Sarathi. To sell the tusks, they enlisted the help of the shopowner and his friend Nanda Kumar. 
Officials arrested all the six after the seizure and booked them under the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused were later produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody
