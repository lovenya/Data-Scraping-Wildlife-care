Nagpur: The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) on Thursday called upon various government agencies in the region to strengthen enforcement so as to tackle increasing crime.
 WCCB is a statutory multidisciplinary body established by the Government of India under the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) to combat organized wildlife crime in the country. Nagpur being centrally located and well connected nationally, there has been a spurt in wildlife crime here, specially trafficking of wildlife parts by railways.
