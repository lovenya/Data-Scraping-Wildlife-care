BHUBANESWAR: The special task force (STF) of the state Crime Branch on Friday busted an ivory smuggling racket in Jajpur with the arrest of three persons. Three tusks were seized from their possession. This is the second such case, involving the smuggling of elephant tusks in the state, in the last four days.
Acting on an intelligence input, the STF sleuths raided a place near Kantabandha Chhak near Brahmani bridge in Jajpur and arrested Pitabas Barik, Ananda Mohakud and Ambuja Pradhan for allegedly trying to sell the tusks.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThey had planned to sell each tusk for Rs 4 lakh. However, the STF officials are yet to lay their hands on the buyers.
“We are trying to find out the source from where they received the tusks. They appeared to be the middlemen. During investigation, we will try to identify the other members of the syndicate, including the poachers,” STF’s deputy inspector general J N Pankaj said. The probe agency has registered a case under sections 379 (theft) and 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. The seized tusks will be sent to the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for forensic examination.
In the last one year, the STF has seized eight leopard skins, seven elephant tusks, 5 kg pangolin scales, two live pangolins, two deer skin and 460 kg sandalwood from different districts.
