Crime head-wise cases, compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), revealed that only 55 cases were registered in the country last year under the Air and Water Prevention & Control of Pollution Act even as violations under these laws in one or the other forms appear to be one of the most glaring environment related offences in India. The number of cases under the Act declined substantially from 589 in 2020 to 55 last year.

Delhi and Punjab did not register any case under these laws that provide for the prevention, control and abatement of air/water pollution, and assign pollution control boards powers and functions to take required action to deal with violations, if any.
