BHUBANESWAR: The special task force (STF) of Odisha Crime Branch here on Friday issued a helpline number (9439263646) to receive information on wildlife crime in the state.
“We will not disclose the names of the informers. If their information leads to the rescue or recovery of wild animals/ their body parts, and arrest of the accused, they would be suitable rewarded,” J N Pankaj, the deputy inspector general of the STF, said.
Though the STF’s job is to curb organised crimes in the state, the protection of the endangered wildlife species and crackdown on wildlife smugglers have remained their focus areas.
“We have been launching special drives at regular intervals. The STF has seized 12 leopard skins, six elephant tusks, skin of two deer, rescued two live pangolins and recovered five kg of pangolin scales from different districts in the last one year. Altogether 24 wildlife criminals have been arrested and 13 cases registered during the one year,” Pankaj said.
On Friday, the STF arrested two poachers from Bolagada in Khurda district and seized a leopard skin from their possession. The accused were identified as Sudhir Behera and Subash Chandra Behera, both residents of Nayagarh district. They were planning to strike a deal with another smuggler when they were caught. The seized leopard skin will be sent to the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for chemical examination.
Earlier on March 27, the forest officials had arrested six persons, including a woman in Bhubaneswar, for allegedly smuggling snake venom. Nearly two litres of the venom was seized from them.
The Crime Branch had also recently asked SPs to remain vigilant on social networking sites and e-commerce portals, dealing with organs of wildlife animals. The instruction had come following the arrest of a man from Laxmisagar in Bhubaneswar in July 2017 for the alleged online sale of wildlife products to foreign countries.
