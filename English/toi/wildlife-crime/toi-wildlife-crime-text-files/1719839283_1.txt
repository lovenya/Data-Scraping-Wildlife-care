The range forest officer (RFO) Rakesh Bhoir, who was part of the raiding team, said, "Since all these birds taken from the house in Fort are scheduled species under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, a preliminary offence report (POR) has been lodged against the house resident (D'souza) for illegally keeping the birds and the bats."
