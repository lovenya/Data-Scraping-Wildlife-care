Pilibhit: A day after rescuing 74 turtles from three smugglers, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) authorities on Monday released them into water bodies after obtaining permission from the court to do so. 
Giving details, Naveen Khandelwal, divisional forest officer of PTR, said the rescued turtles belonged to the Indian softshell and Indian flap shell species, protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 
The smugglers were carrying the live turtles in three plastic bags in a car. On seeing the patrol team, they first accelerated to flee but chased by the forest staff, they threw the bags out, ditched the car and fled by two bikes which were following their car, said Wazir Hassan, range officer of Mahof. 
A departmental case was registered against the unidentified smugglers while the car was impounded, said the DFO. 
Earlier in 2018, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau had identified Pilibhit-Kheri zone as one of the five most sensitive regions in UP in terms of turtle poaching and illegal trading.
