CHENNAI: Air passengers who bring in exotic animals or reptiles from Thailand and other southeast Asian countries may get arrested by the state police as the authorities are planning to involve multiple enforcement agencies to take stringent action to curb the smuggling at Chennai airport. 
Now, smugglers are not charged by police.
The need for a comprehensive and stringent action from different enforcement agencies including the economic offences wing of the state police, the directorate of revenue intelligence and enforcement directorate was discussed at a meeting held at the Chennai airport on Friday.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, southern region, deputy director Kirupasankar M said "When live exotic animals such as leopard cubs are smuggled, it is being done for a huge monetary consideration. When the state police also file cases under economic offences, it will act as a deterrent for smugglers, he added.
Airlines officials said at the meeting that the enforcement agencies in some of the Southeast Asian countries focus more on passenger security. They act only when there is a tip off.
Affordable fares and short duration of flights to Chennai are among the factors that contributed to the increase in the smuggling of live pets.
Officials from the customs, immigration, directorate of revenue intelligence, enforcement directorate, CISF, AAI, forest department, police, Zoological Survey of India and representatives from Thai airlines and AirAsia took part.
