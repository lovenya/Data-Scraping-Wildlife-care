Adin Singh was nabbed in Gyaraspur, situated along the Vidisha-Sagar highway. His arrest marks a major milestone in the fight against the illegal hunting and trafficking of endangered species, said officials.
Singh’s criminal activities encompassed hunting tigers, pangolins, and trading their parts. The investigation revealed that Singh was part of an international gang involved in these activities.
Several states, including Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Assam and Meghalaya, were affected due to his illegal trade activities. Officers say that his arrest is expected to bolster tiger conservation not only within Madhya Pradesh but across India. The Forest and Police Department of various states, along with the Nepal Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), had been relentlessly pursuing Adin Singh and his accomplices for several years.
Officials said Singh’s arrest was a testament to meticulous planning and efficiency of cross-border cooperation in combating wildlife crimes. During the operation, authorities recovered evidence linking Singh to his nefarious activities. Tiger whiskers, teeth and parts of pangolins were confiscated from his possession. Adin Singh has been remanded in custody until August 23 for further investigations.
