Ravi told forest officials that he was upset with bird droppings as they were spoiling the area beneath the tree, which was his preferred hangout spot. Using sticks, he had brought down all the bird nests from the tree, resulting in the deaths of 24 young birds on Monday. He was apprehended on Tuesday.
An officer expressed that witnessing the incident was heart-wrenching, as the newly hatched young ones had perished. Cormorants haven't been known to breed frequently in Mysuru recently; their presence is uncommon. However, due to the favorable surroundings with abundant water bodies and a food source like fish, which is their favorite, these birds had constructed nests and hatched eggs. Typically, these water birds stay in Mysuru for around two months before migrating.
The incident might have severely affected the bird population, and it's likely that they won't breed or return to Mysuru in the future, according to an officer's statement.
