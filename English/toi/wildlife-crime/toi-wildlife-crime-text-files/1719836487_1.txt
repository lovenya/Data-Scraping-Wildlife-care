THANE: With an aim to ensure crimes against wildlife are taking into account while doling out police character certificates, the Thane Wildlife Warden, on Tuesday, wrote to the police commissioner of Thane requesting him to link the forest and wildlife crime data with the police database. 
While these police clearance certificates or character certificates are issued by the police after a thorough check of the individual’s criminal record, Pawan Sharma, Thane forest department’s wildlife warden, found that many who committed crimes against wildlife were not questioned about the same as the police did not have these records. 
“Character certificates are compulsory in seeking government jobs, corporate jobs, or in passport and visa applications, etc. Since this data is not linked there are chances where many wildlife criminals can easily get their character certificates,” said Sharma.
“The idea of this initiative is to send out a loud and clear message in the public domain that wildlife crimes are equally punishable as any other serious crime. Today it is observed that many youngsters and even educated people are getting involved in offences against the environment under the wildlife protection acts. Such linkage of data will help in creating fear and pressure of law and help in reducing such crimes,” Sharma said.
