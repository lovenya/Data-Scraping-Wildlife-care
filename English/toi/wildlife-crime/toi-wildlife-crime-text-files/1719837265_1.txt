HARIDWAR: After an alert by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau that poachers may infiltrate the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) disguised as tourists, officials of the reserve said that they have strengthened security measures and have also released four sketches of suspected poachers belonging to the Bawaria gang —infamous for poaching in the reserve — among their staff members. “We have been told that the poachers might try any trick, including gaining entry inside the reserve disguised as tourists.Therefore, we have doubled the security checks and are not just patrolling with human force but are also using drones to sanitise the areas,” said Rahul, director of CTR (who uses only his first name).
Sources in the state wildlife cell said that poachers of the gang are “desperate to raise money in order to free one of their gang leaders, Bheema, a notorious tiger poacher who had evaded police for 15 years, before finally being nabbed three years ago.” “They are more desperate than ever to poach animals and raise money as they want their leader to be out from jail on bail or maybe to pay the fee of his lawyer to get the case sorted out at the earliest,” the source said. 
The CTR director said that in view of the threat from poachers and the advisory issued in this regard, tourists were being allowed inside the reserve after a thorough checking, “Harveli near the Uttarakhand-Bijnor border is the area where Bawarias have set up their local deras these days and we are keeping a vigil on those spots too,” he added.
Meanwhile, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat told TOI that “our forest force is well prepared to handle any kind of situation day and night.” “We will do whatever it takes to protect our wild animals,” he added. This year, 20 instances of forest and wildlife crimes have surfaced from CTR while in the previous year (2018-19), the count of such crimes stood at 101. In 2017-18, a total of 66 crimes were recorded, as per data provided to TOI by the forest department.
