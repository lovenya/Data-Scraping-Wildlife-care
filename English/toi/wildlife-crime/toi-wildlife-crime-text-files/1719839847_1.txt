BHUBANESWAR: One of the three poachers arrested with leopard hides on Sunday fled from the forest department's custody while he was undergoing treatment in a Baripada hospital, resulting in a show cause notice being served on the range officer who was entrusted with securing his custody.
Rupy Marndi, who has been allegedly involved in wildlife trade for a long time, complained of uneasiness following his arrest.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHe was admitted to a hospital and two forest staff were asked to keep vigil. "We have launched a manhunt to nab Marndi. His name is known and his hideouts are also known. Four teams are on the job to catch him," said Santosh Joshi, divisional forest officer, Baripada.
The other two accused, Budhuram Singh and Mangal Singh, were produced in court and were remanded in judicial custody after their bail pleas were rejected. 
Once in hospital, Marndi was given saline. Marndi apparently feigned uneasiness and while the forest personnel were not looking, got rid of the saline drip and fled.
