PILIBHIT: For the first time, forest guards of Pilibhit tiger reserve (PTR) underwent a training on understanding the legal aspects and application of penal sections while dealing with wildlife crimes. A senior criminal lawyer having expertise in wildlife and forest-related crimes conducted the training session. 
“It has been observed that many wildlife criminals are acquitted by court due to lack of law-related knowledge of the forest guards.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe training will be helpful in improving legal proceedings which in turn will pave the way for the wildlife criminals’ definite conviction by the court,” said Naveen Khandelwal, PTR’s deputy director. 
“The forest guards have to prepare reports regarding forest and the wildlife crimes, including the recovery and the seizure report, the arrest memo and the preliminary offence report. These reports form the base for the trial of the criminal. Therefore, knowledge of legal aspects is necessary,” the forest official said. 
In the next training session, forest inspectors will undergo training on the same lines, Khandelwal said. 
At the training session, forest guards were informed about various IPC sections and provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act, said Naresh Kumar, senior project officer, World Wide Fund-India.
