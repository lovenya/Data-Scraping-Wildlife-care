GUWAHATI: A Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB)-led operation has busted a hideout for making country guns at a hilly village in Karbi Anglong district, bordering the Kaziranga National Park. 
The operation, carried out with the help of police and CRPF, led to the arrest of two persons-Jiten Loktha (55) and Kon Rongpi (37) from Jogota Pahar area under Dokmoka police station on Tuesday evening. Two single barrel gun, wooden butts, an air gun barrel, an iron pipe for making gun barrel and a skin of civet cat were seized from the duos.
The operation was led at a time when animals from the bordering Kaziranga were escaping the flood and taking shelter on the highlands of Karbi Anglong.
WCCB sources said that the guns made in the hideout were used for poaching animals from Kaziranga after they take shelter on the Karbi Anglong side. They also said that there is also possibility of supplying these guns to poachers based in the nearby Jakhalabandha area of Nagaon district for killing animals when they stray out of the park during flood.
While interrogation of the duo is still on, wildlife crime experts said there could be many more such gun-making hideouts along the Karbi Anglong-Kaziranga border that become active with the onset of monsoon.
"Many animals do not return to Kaziranga from Karbi Anglong after flood subsides. These is because of rampant poaching during floods," a WCCB official said. WCCB sources said investigation is on whether the hideout has any link with militants as in the past involvement of rebels from Karbi Anglong were found in poaching rhinos in Kaziranga. .
