State’s chief wildlife warden Hari Shankar Upadhyay said Odisha has witnessed several cases related to smuggling of pangolins.
“Smuggling of this animal is on the rise. There is no consumption of pangolin in Odisha. It has a market in outside of the country like China and Vietnam. We have informed the special task force (STF) of the Crime Branch of Odisha and WCCB, New Delhi, about the smuggling cases,” he added.
