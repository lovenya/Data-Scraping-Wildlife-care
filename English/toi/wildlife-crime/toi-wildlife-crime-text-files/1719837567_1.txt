Kolkata: A pair of Asiatic black bear cubs, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act and considered ‘vulnerable’ on IUCN Red list, were rescued from Indo-Bangla border in Hasnabad on Friday night. The cubs, which were handed over to the forest department in the wee hours of Saturday, were brought to Alipore Zoo later in the morning. 
A special operation group of Basirhat District Police conducted the raid around 9pm on Friday at Murarisha Ghoshpara under Hasnabad police station area on India-Bangladesh border.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“The area falls under Basirhat sub-division. The raid was also conducted on some hutments in the border area. Finally, the two cubs were found in a desolate area on the border and rescued,” said police. The forest department was informed soon and a team of vets reached the spot and attended to the cubs. 
SP of Basirhat, Joby Thomas, said: “Acting on a tip-off, a special operation group conducted the raid at Hasnabad Indo-Bangla border where two bear cubs were abandoned. We suspect they were smuggled to India from Bangladesh. The accused fled sensing trouble.” Cops are probing involvement of an international racket. 
Member secretary of state zoo authority, Sourav Chowdhury, said the cubs are around two-months-old. “We are hand-feeding them at zoo and giving them milk and honey. As of now they are doing fine. Both are male cubs and each weigh around 2.5kg,” he said. Regional deputy director of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (east), Agni Mitra, said: “There were earlier information about illegal smuggling of Asiatic black bears through the border. This time the Bengal police raid managed to rescue two cubs. It’s possible they were brought from the wild in Chittagong hill tracts. We will alert Bangladesh officials soon.”
