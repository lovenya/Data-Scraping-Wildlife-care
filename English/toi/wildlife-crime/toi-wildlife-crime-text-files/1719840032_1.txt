PILIBHIT: The authorities of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) have implemented immediate measures to enhance field patrolling in the core forest regions of the reserve, following a 'red alert' issued by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) on June 29, which raised concerns about possible poacher intrusion in 11 tiger reserves across the country, including Pilibhit and Amangarh Tiger Reserves in Uttar Pradesh.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) of Uttar Pradesh, Sudhir Kumar Sharma, who also serves as the chief wildlife warden of the state, stated that the WCCB's action was based on intelligence inputs received from their sources.
To address the situation, the authorities have initiated an intensive search and vehicle checking operation on all roads passing through the reserve. Additionally, they have directed the identification of sensitive spots within the reserves and increased vigilance in those areas. People residing near railway stations, bus stations, public shelter camps, temples, and abandoned structures are being checked. The police officials have been requested to assist forest personnel in identifying individuals, especially nomads, and conducting seizure operations when necessary.
Naveen Khandelwal, the divisional forest officer (DFO) of PTR, said, “The monsoon season is crucial in terms of safety and security. Due to waterlogging, routine field patrolling becomes challenging during this time, which can be exploited by poachers and wildlife criminals.”

They are encouraged to immediately report any suspicious information to the PTR authorities. Protective operations, including round-the-clock vehicle checking, are being carried out.”
Notably, according to a report by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the country reported the deaths of 117 tigers in the previous year, with 10 cases involving the seizure of tiger body.
