Bhubaneswar: Buoyed by the success of the dog squad for preventing more than 100 cases of poaching since its induction in October 2021, Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) authorities have decided to increase its strength from two to four. The dogs — Maya and Drona (in photo) — trained by Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Haryana, have detected snares laid by poachers.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWhile Drona has expertise in finding elephant tusks, Maya can track humans.
“The routes of poachers were identified by the dogs days after their escape from the forests. They help track the whereabouts of poachers by sniffing through animal blood stains and belongings left behind.“Considering their successful commissioning and usefulness in preventing wildlife crimes, we have decided to add two more dogs to the squad. The existing squad becomes exhausted as it has to trek around 10km in a day and it needs to be shifted from one station to another based on requirement,” said Similipal deputy director (north) Sai Kiran. 
The two German shepherd dogs have been trained to identify poachers’ footprints from gunpowder, bullets, hunting guns, bows and arrows. The squad is now deployed at Pithabata range and moves to other ranges and divisions. They are taken care of in a kennel to avoid infections. The dogs have two main handlers and two assistants. The dogs have been useful during combing operations. Due to their training, they are comfortable in the forest with adept handlers. “Mostly, we use their services during summer and winter. In the rainy season, they are not taken inside the forest. Besides preventing poaching, the squad helps check illegal fishing,” a wildlife officer said.
