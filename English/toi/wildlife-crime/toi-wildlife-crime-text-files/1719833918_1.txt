The property belongs to a contractor Mangal Sing Rongpi and he was not present during our operation. Rongpi later contacted us and assured of cooperation in our investigation,” the official said.
He said that a veterinary team from the Bokakhat-based Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) was called to tranquilize the deer. The deer were taken to CWRC where the animals are under observation.
