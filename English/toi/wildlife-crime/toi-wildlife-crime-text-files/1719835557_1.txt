They claimed that they had brought the Pangolin from Silbori village in Darang district to sell it to an agent in the city. 
The Chinese pangolin, also commonly referred to as scaly anteaters, is considered to be a critically endangered species. These animals are widely trafficked globally as there is a huge demand for their scales and meat. WCCB sources said around 6000 pangolins were recovered from smugglers across the country between 2009 and 2017. "There is a huge demand for these mammals in China and southeast Asia where pangolin meat is considered a delicacy and a tonic food because of its alleged medicinal properties. Pangolin scales are used as an ingredient in traditional medicines as they are believed to cure various ailments," the sources added.
