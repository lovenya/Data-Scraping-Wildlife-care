Chatterjee has been booked under sections 9, 11, 39, 48A, 49 and 49A of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 for illegal wildlife capture, transport and possession of the animals. If proven guilty, she can be jailed for up to seven years. 
The notice was sent to her on February 15. However, she skipped two dates but appeared before the officers on Monday. Sources in the forest department said she told them that the mongoose belonged to a driver who used to keep it in his car and that one day, she had held it in the middle of a shoot and clicked some photos without knowing about the violation of the act.
The officers however have asked her along with the driver and other members of the shooting unit again this week for further questioning.
