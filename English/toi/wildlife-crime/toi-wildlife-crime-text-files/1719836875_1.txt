BENGALURU: Two bags containing 170 star tortoises were abandoned, allegedly by some wildlife traffickers, near a travel agency at Kalasipalya on Friday. They were found later and sent to the rescue centre at Bannerghatta Biological Park, police said.
The incident came to light when a private bus service staffer came to the police station with eight boxes of tortoises and claimed they were found abandoned outside their office.The staff said the bags were not part of the parcels received at the office.
“We are scanning CCTV footage from the area to check who brought the tortoises there. The private buses had, on Friday morning, ferried passengers from Hyderabad, Mumbai and other places to the city. But the bags don’t have any receipt on them and were not entered in the ‘parcel’ register of the buses. We suspect someone who was not a passenger brought them near the office,” an officer said.
Sources said the star tortoises are barely two months old and could have been brought from the forest areas in Chikkaballapur district and from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. Such tortoises are sometimes smuggled to foreign countries to be reared as pets.
According to wildlife activist Sharath Babu, trafficking Indian star tortoises is a crime under the Wildlife Protection Act and punishment for offenders is jail term of up to three years and penalty of up to Rs 25,000.
