PILIBHIT: Based on circumstantial evidence, environmentalists have expressed fears that Pilibhit's stray tiger of Himkanpur has been killed by poachers. Forest authorities have been unable to pinpoint the location of the animal for the past 25 days as no reports of killing of any domestic animal or prey have been received. The tiger had attacked and killed three people in Amaria block in quick succession after straying out of Mala range of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve on July 15.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Now, in the absence of any news about the tiger's whereabouts, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau volunteer Kalim Athar has sent a letter to National Tiger Conservation Authori ty expressing fears that the tiger has been killed by poachers by now. Forest officials, however, ruled out poaching as the reason for its disappearance.
After the last killing in Himkanpur, the forest officials had conducted a month-long operation to localize this animal there by artificially creating an ideal habitat in order to tranquilize it and shift it to Lucknow zoo. The operation was later suspended as the tiger could not be traced.
Asked why he feared that the tiger had been killed, Athar said, “No tiger can remain hungry for about a month. From the day it strayed from PTR till its final disappearance, the big cat killed prey at intervals but now, no such information is available.“
