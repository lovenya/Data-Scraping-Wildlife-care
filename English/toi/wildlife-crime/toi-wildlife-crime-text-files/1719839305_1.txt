MUMBAI: The Fort resident, Pradeep D'souza, who was earlier arrested by forest officials for keeping several wildlife protected bird species inside his house, has been released on bail by the local court. 
His advocate had produced a correspondence that D'souza had written to the forest department in the year 2020 stating that he was taking care of many injured and ailing birds and also animal species, and so did not hide this fact from the authorities.
"The letter that my client Pradeep had written to the conservator of forests (Thane) in March 2020 had given all the details on how the wildlife bird species like kites, barn owls, egrets and even bats were kept in his house. However, the forest authorities did not act on it then. The court has acknowledged this letter and since the investigating officer (IO) did not raise any objection to the bail, he was granted bail," said advocate Siddh Vidya.
Last week, the wildlife crime control bureau (WCCB) and the forest officials had jointly raided the house of D'souza and seized scheduled species like kites, parrots, barn owls, and even bats among others, while also arresting him under the Wildlife (Protection) Action, 1972.
