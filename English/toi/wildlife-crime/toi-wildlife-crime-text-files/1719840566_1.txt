CHENNAI: With the Alexandrine parakeet breeding season kicking in, conservationists and bird lovers are an anxious lot as they fear that smugglers will start collecting baby parakeets from their nests.
Shravan Krishnan, a conservationist, said these birds are in great demand in the pet trade, and are found breeding in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The Narikuruvas from Tiruvallur district visit Guntur and Chittoor districts to illegally lay their hands on baby parakeets.

A parakeet lays up to 4 eggs tha hatch in about a month. These birds build their nests in hollow portions of fruit bearing trees.
Krishnan said the narikuruvas climb trees after dark and collect 50 baby parakeets from a dozen trees. They usually transport the parakeets by night trains to Chennai, and alight a few stations ahead of Central railway station to escape police. Smugglers involved in parakeet trade collect them from narikuruvas for 2,000 a pair.

"They are habitual offenders who are in the trade for more than a decade," said a forest official.
With demand for these birds spiking among pet lovers, a pair of Alexandrine baby parakeets is priced at 6,000 in the grey market. In the last decade, Alexandrine parakeet was under the 'least concerned' category of the International Union for Conservation of Natural Flora and Fauna (IUCN). Now, these birds have been put under the 'near threatened' category.
The State Wildlife Crime Control Bureau is gearing up to take severe action against parakeet smugglers to protect these birds from extinction. The forest department has been proposed to slap the Goondas Act on smugglers of parakeets. Authorities are hopeful that such a move will act a a deterrent to those involved in the illegal trade of the Alexandrine parakeets.
