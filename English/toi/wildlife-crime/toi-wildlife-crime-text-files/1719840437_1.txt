AIZAWL: The majority of exotic animals from Southeast Asia were smuggled through Champhai district on Mizoram-Myanmar border, officials of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, ministry of environment, forests and climate change, said on Wednesday.
The officials, led by joint director Manoj Kumar, held a coordination meeting of enforcement agencies in the office of the divisional forest officer of Champhai district to discuss about the wildlife crime and prevention of smuggling of exotic animal.
It was mentioned during the meeting that there had been a seizure of exotic animals on seven occasions in the Champhai district from January last year till October this year, during which 723 exotic animals of different species were seized.
Kumar said there has been an immense increase in smuggling of exotic animals through the northeast region and West Bengal during the last two years with Champhai district becoming the main conduit for such operations.
"A high majority of exotic animal smuggling was detected during the recent months," he said.
The Wildlife Protection Act 1972, meant to protect the country's wildlife, required to be amended to include protection of wildlife in other countries by inclusion of smuggling of animals from foreign countries, he said. He said steps have been taken to ensure early passage of the amendment bill in the Parliament that would also include prevention of smuggling of wild animals from India to other countries.
