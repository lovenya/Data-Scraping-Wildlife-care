 On the possibility of failing to lift the carcass on time by poachers, Sharadh said, “The carcass of a crocodile is quite heavy and needs some mode of lifting and transportation.” He added that a complete hide of a matured crocodile was recently been recovered in Nepal and the WCCB was probing whether the criminal activity had a link in Pilibhit.
 The WCCB officer said as the carcass was recovered from the canal, it could have been drifted away from the spot where it was killed. “The forest force therefore need to investigate this matter in a broader aspect keeping in view the criminal activities against wildlife in areas situated in the upper stream of the feeder canal as well,” said Sharadh.
