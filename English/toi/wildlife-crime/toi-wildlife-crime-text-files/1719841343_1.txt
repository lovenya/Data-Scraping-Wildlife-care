A senior wildlife official from Tamil Nadu said the seizure raised suspicion that smugglers had shifted operations to Bengaluru following increased vigil in Chennai. However, another senior official said one incident did not signal a shift.
On Sunday night, customs officials at Chennai airport seized a Burmese python, a ball python, and half a dozen baby iguanas. Both python species are in great demand in the illegal pet trade. The Customs officials sent the consignment back to its place of origin.

The Union government made amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, recently to include some of the species that are covered under the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES). Despite that the wildlife trade is thriving, they say.
With increased checks at airports across the country, the smugglers are transporting exotic pets by road. Recently, a large number of star tortoises were seized from a person, when he attempted to smuggle them out of the country through the Myanmar border.
