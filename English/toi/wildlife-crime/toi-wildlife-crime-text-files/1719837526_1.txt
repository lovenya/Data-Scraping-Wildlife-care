Damoh had been a major hunting ground for poachers for the last many years. A few years ago, state forest department’s Special Task Force (STF wildlife crime) had booked four forest department employees for letting off four of seven alleged poachers in a blackbuck poaching case. STF said forest officials were accused of not producing before the court. They were also accused of disposing confiscated carcass without court’s permission and presence of an authorized person. They were booked under sections 50, 51, 52 and 53 of Wildlife (Protection Act 1972)- charges liable for jail term for three to seven years, said STF officials.Three forest guards have been suspended and action is likely to be taken against the range officer, if he doesn’t reply to the explanation sought from him, STF officials said.
A black buck poaching case was reported from Bakani village of Damoh district. Forest officials arrested three people after which a massive protest was initiated in the region with locals alleging that the wrong people were arrested. 
There are many other incidents of poaching in the region. Two poachers were arrested from Seoni. They too were looking for blackbucks. Two of their gang members escaped. Investigations are on.
