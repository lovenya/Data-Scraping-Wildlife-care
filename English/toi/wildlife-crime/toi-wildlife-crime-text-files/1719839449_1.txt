GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad police, in a joint operation with the People for Animals NGO, seized 135 parrots and four tortoises from a smuggler on Wednesday. 
Of the 135 parrots, 125 were found dead, possibly due to breathing issues. The police arrested one of the three smugglers, while the other two managed to escape.
A First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged, encompassing various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other relevant acts. 
The IPC sections include 308 (pertaining to attempted murder), 506 (relating to criminal intimidation), and 429 (involving committing mischief by causing harm to animals).

We immediately alerted the Kaushambi police. Our team and the police reached the spot. We observed Faizan stepping out of an auto-rickshaw with two cages covered by a white cloth. As I approached him, he attempted to attack me with a knife, but our team and the police apprehended him."
Maneka Gandhi, the founder of PFA, said that this gang had been operating from Rampur due to certain forests in the area, and they are also active in Bareilly. 
She said, "They catch these birds to transport them to Meerut and Delhi. Many of these smugglers have relatives in Delhi, as they sell these birds at Jama Masjid, which is the largest bird market in India and should be shut down."
The two absconding accused are a father and son.
Swatantra Kumar Singh, ACP of Indirapuram, said, "We have arrested one of the smugglers, and efforts are under way to locate the other two. Upon receiving an alert from the NGO, our team promptly responded, rescuing the parrots and tortoises. Sadly, most of the parrots were found dead."
