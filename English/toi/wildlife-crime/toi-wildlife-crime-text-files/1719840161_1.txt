NOIDA: Two men were arrested from Greater Noida’s Chipiyana village on Thursday for allegedly smuggling an elephant tusk weighing 1.8 kg.
A joint operation was conducted by the UP Police STF and cops from Bisrakh police station following a tip-off from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. “We were informed two men were on their way to the Bisrakh area to sell the ivory.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoOur teams caught two people with the tusk that was kept in a laptop bag,” a statement issued by the STF said. The accused — Ankur Mathur of Crossings Republik and Rajat Panwar of Solan — came to NCR to finalise the deal but did not know where the tusk was from.
