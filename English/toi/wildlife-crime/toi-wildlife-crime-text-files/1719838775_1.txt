Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad police late on Friday arrested a duo for attempting to sell five sets of Indian antelope (Blackbuck) horns worth over Rs5 lakh on Chakan-Shikrapur Road.
The police nabbed Sachin Gajanan Rathod (22) and Sagar Ramrao Matre (23) from Dwarha in Yavatmal following a tip-off, which stated that they were looking for customers. A case under the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act has been registered against them with the Chakan police.
A team of forest officials confirmed the authenticity of the horns after inspection. “The suspects installed barbed wires with electrical current at their agricultural land in Yavatmal district. Blackbucks would get entangled in these wires and die of electrical shock. They would then removed their horns with an intention to sell them in Pune,” the police said.
The suspects currently reside in Shikrapur and work as helpers in a private firm on Pune-Ahmednagar highway.
