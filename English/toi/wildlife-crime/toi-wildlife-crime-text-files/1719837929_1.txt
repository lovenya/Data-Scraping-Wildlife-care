BHUBANESWAR: The Special Task Force (STF) of the Crime Branch on Tuesday arrested the driver of a private university and seized leopard skin from him. The accused was identified as Prasant Kumar Naik (33) of Mayurbhanj district.
The STF arrested Naik near a Kali Temple in Baramunda area. Officers said he was allegedly planning to sell the leopard skin to a wildlife parts smuggler for around Rs 5 lakh. The probe agency said the accused had allegedly procured the leopard skin from a middleman in Nayagarh district.
The skin’s snout-vent length was around 49 inches, tail 31 inches, front and hind legs 46 inches each and its torso was 21 inches.“We found a bullet wound on the left side of the tail, which raises the suspicion that the leopard might have been gunned down. We will send the leopard skin to the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for a chemical examination,” STF’s deputy inspector general J N Pankaj said.
The chemical or forensic test will ascertain the age of the animal as well as the exact nature of death.
