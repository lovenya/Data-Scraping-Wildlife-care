CHENNAI: Customs and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) authorities at the Chennai airport have busted half a dozen exotic wildlife smuggling cases in the last one month and almost all the seized wildlife have been deported. The spurt in smuggling of exotic wildlife has led to increased vigil at the airport by the Customs and DRI.
Of the six cases, five of the illegal consignments have been deported.One of them could not be deported as the two marmosets in the consignment was found dead, said the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau deputy director M Kirupasankar. Iguanas, aldabra tortoises, marmosets, De Brazza monkeys, ball pythons, tarsier monkeys, white porcupines, armadillo and sugar gliders were the exotic wildlife in the seized consignments. 
All these are small species and the majority of them were covered under the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES). Talking about the modus operandi of the smugglers, Kirupasankar said all the seized exotic wildlife were in checked-in baggage and they came from a single destination - Bangkok by Thai airways. 
Already, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which is the CITES authority for south India, had written letters to their counterparts in Bangkok, he said.
