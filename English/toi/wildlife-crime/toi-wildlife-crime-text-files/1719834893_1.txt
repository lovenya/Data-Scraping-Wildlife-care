MUMBAI: A monkey wreaked havoc on the city police headquarters premises at Crawford market on Wednesday and bit a constable before it was caught. 
Ankit Vyas, a volunteer with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, a statutory body to combat organized wildlife crime, said the police called up the forest department, after which a trap was laid for the monkey. “It appears that the monkey had escaped from a juggler,” said Vyas.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Constable Shitesh Karande received minor injuries after monkey bit him.
A few months ago, a monkey had created nuisance at Lower Parel, Elphinstone Road and Mahalaxmi stations for 10 days, harassing and biting commuters. It took the forest department a week to nab the monkey in November as it kept avoiding the traps laid for it.tnn
