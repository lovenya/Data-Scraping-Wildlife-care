“The accused could not produce any valid papers in support of the possession of the leopard skins for which they were arrested. We are trying to find out the source from where they possessed the skins. It is suspected they are just the carriers, and not poachers,” an STF official said.
The STF found bullet-wounds on the leopard skins, raising suspicion that they may have been gunned down. The STF will send the seized wildlife parts to the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for forensic examination. In the last two years the STF had seized at least 33 leopard skins and arrested 50 people across the state.
