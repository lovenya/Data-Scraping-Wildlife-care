AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat University police registered a complaint of criminal breach of trust and cheating on Saturday, filed by Jindal Wildlife Limited, Ambawadi, against one of its employees. 
The complainant alleged that sometime between January 2020 and June 8, 2021, one Hardik Pandya who worked as a senior executive in the credit control department of the company, had embezzled Rs 15.36 lakh of the company’s money.
According to the complaint filed by Bhavik Modi, 28, the legal officer of Jindal Wildlife, Pandya was in charge of recovering dues and pending payments on behalf of the company. 
Pandya, a resident of Ghatlodia, allegedly abused his position and made off with the company’s money which he collected from dealers but didn’t deposit in the company’s account.

Sharma then contacted other firms and found Pandya had deposited Rs 9.92 lakh collected from various firms in his personal account. Also, in another case a company in Ratanpole had paid Rs 5.44 lakh in various instalment and Pandya, instead of depositing this amount to the company account, had deposited the same in his personal account. 
Thus, according to the complaint, he had cheated the company of Rs 15.36 lakh in total. 
The GU police have registered the complaint against Pandya under IPC Section 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant).
