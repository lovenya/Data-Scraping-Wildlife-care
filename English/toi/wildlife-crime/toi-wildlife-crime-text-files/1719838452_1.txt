PILIBHIT: In a first, officials of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and the forest and wildlife division were imparted training on forensic techniques and wildlife crime prevention strategies by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) experts at a four-day session that ended on Tuesday.
H Rajamohan, PTR field director, said the training will aid in making watertight cases against criminals based on scientific analysis and collection of evidence from crime spots.

PC Pandey, regional head of WTI, said, “Forensic plays a pivotal role in scientifically identifying and collecting the evidence at ground zero. This is the prime work upon which depends the success of the conviction rate as well as the rejection of criminal’s bail."
Prashant Kumar, forensic expert, said, “It is imperative to first seal the spot of wildlife crime to protect the ground evidence from spoilage. The forest personnel need to search for clues of criminals which might be tested for DNA such as spitted tobacco juice, cigarette butts or any object which has fingerprints and any piece of poisoned flesh. Preservation of evidence is another salient process.”
Monesh Singh Tomar, expert in crime prevention strategies, said the field forest teams are essentially required to have detailed knowledge about types of wildlife crimes.They can prevent a crime by knowing about the kind of snares and traps set by poachers and possible spots where they are set up so that these can be removed in time.
“Normally, poachers set up snares and traps in the fringe area of core forest or in adjoining agricultural fields to keep out of the forest department's radar. The bike’s clutch wire, which is quite cheap, is used for making snares but there is no offence if anyone is seen carrying it near the core forest,” he said.
