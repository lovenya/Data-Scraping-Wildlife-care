NEW DELHI: An international sandalwood smuggling racket was busted by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch and a smuggler arrested with wood worth Rs 2 crore from a south Delhi farmhouse.
The accused, Amit Verma, a resident of Darjeeling in West Bengal, along with his gang were smuggling sandalwood from southern states to other parts of the country and abroad. Eight logs weighing 571kg have been seized, police said.
DCP (Crime) Ram Gopal Naik said, a Special Task Force was tipped off about a large consignment of smuggled wood been stored at a rented farmhouse in south Delhi’s Jasola. ACP Pankaj Singh and inspector Jatan Singh’s team laid a trap and arrested Verma. The wood, which was concealed under scrap clothes, was recovered and seized. 
“To identify the recovered logs, a wildlife inspector was called on the spot, who identified them as red sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus), which are of superior quality. An FIR has been registered under the Indian Forest Act,” Naik added.

The sandalwood was smuggled from Karnataka to Delhi in trucks and was delivered to Verma in Delhi. Two Nepalese men have been identified as the main receivers of the illegal sandalwood in Delhi, who further smuggled them to China and other countries. Efforts are being made to trace them as well, police said. 
Verma ran a shoe business in Siliguri. But after incurring successive losses in the business, he came to Delhi in search of a job. The police had earlier arrested Verma’s cousin in September 2018 for the same offence.
