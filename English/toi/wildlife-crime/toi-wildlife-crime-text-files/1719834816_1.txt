KOLKATA: In one of the biggest seizures of freshwater turtles in the state, the forest department with the help of local cops seized more than 3,000 flapshell turtles, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, in Burdwan since December 29.
While 1850 turtles were sized on December 29, another 1625 were seized on Sunday at Memari.
Confirming Sunday's development, chief conservator of forest (CCF) Kalyan Das said this is the second time in the last four days that such a huge consignment of these turtles was seized in Burdwan.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“Earlier on Wed nesday , 1850 such turtles were seized in Burdwan and five persons, all residents of Uttar Pradesh, were arrested,“ he said.
The seizures assume significance as the turtles enjoy the same protection status accorded to the Bengal tiger.“On Sunday , we arrested four persons, all residents of UP. Memari police had suspected their activities and stopped their car before informing us. After reaching the spot, we seized the turtles and arrested them,“ Das said, adding that they have also informed the officials of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) who are now investigating the case. The consignment was heading towards Kolkata from UP's Sultanpur.

The Indian flapshell turtle is found in Pakistan, India (common in lakes and rivers), Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh (Indus and Ganges drainages), and Burma (Irrawaddy and Salween rivers).
