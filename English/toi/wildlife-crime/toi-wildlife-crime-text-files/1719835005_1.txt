In context of tiger range countries (TRCs), it is currently being used in Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Russia.
“In India, all important reserves have been taken up. Four teams each headed by senior retired forest officers, one from Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and two NGO representatives, are part of the expert teams, which will visit anti-poaching camps and forest ranges and hold discussions with front-line staff, ” Yadav said.
Yadav further says security audit provides an overview from an outside perspective about where the gaps in protection and enforcement services occur. “This allows the reserves management to redress shortfalls and thereby improve protection that it offers to the biodiversity it is mandated to preserve,” he says.
The audit is being done to make field checks whether security plan guidelines are being followed or not as per the protocol. “This will find out gaps in field implementation and help improve all aspects of protection,” the GTF official said.
Tiger reserve officials said the exercise is apart from the management effective evaluation (MEE) which is done once in every four years. The experts will collect map on man-made features, distribution of species, data pertaining to linear projects threatening reserves, electrocution, crop pattern, human habitations, religious structures, poaching activities, check-points among host of other issues.
