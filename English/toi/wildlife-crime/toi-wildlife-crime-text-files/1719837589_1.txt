Kolhapur: Former honorary wildlife warden of Satara Rohan Bhate and member of wildlife crime control bureau Nana Khamkar have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, appealing for the transfer of newly-declared conservation reserves in Kolhapur forest division from territorial to wildlife wing along with reorganizing various range offices and sanctioning Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF). 
Bhate said, “The conservation reserves namely Chandgad, Dodamarg-Amboli, Ajara-Bhudargad, Gagan Bawda, Panhalgad, Vishalgad, Jor-Jambhali and Mayani will strengthen wildlife corridor between Kali Tiger Reserve in Karnataka to Bhimashankar in Maharashtra.”
He added, “These reserves in Kolhapur forest division need to be moved from territorial wing to wildlife wing and to reorganize the ranges in the region so that the pending STPF deployment in the region can be feasible. This will also bring the entire region under the protection and guarding of SPTF. This in turn will control wildlife crime and illegal bauxite mining.”
Meanwhile, Khamkar, while talking to TOI, said, “The move will greatly help in preserving the corridor between Kali and Sahyadri tiger reserves. As all the conservation reserves will come under the purview of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, it would be appropriate to transfer the areas from the territorial wing to wildlife wing. This will help in the unified control of the entire corridor area which will be beneficial in the management of the region.”
