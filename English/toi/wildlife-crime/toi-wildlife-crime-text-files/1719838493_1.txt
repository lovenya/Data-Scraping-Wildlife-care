The petitioner stated that though the forest officials are taking steps to prevent poaching activities in the state, they are unable to tackle the same due to lack of sufficient manpower. He stated that forest and police officials should work together in order to prevent such crimes. 
Rajamanickam stated that the Supreme Court in a verdict had held that police officials are empowered to investigate and take action in incidents of wildlife crimes under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

However, in Tamil Nadu only the official at the rank of forest ranger is empowered to take cognizance of the offences, due to which several offences go unnoticed. 
Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction to the Tamil Nadu government to notify that police officers could also take steps to prevent, detect and file complaints under the Act. He also sought to constitute a special wing at district and state level to prevent poaching activities in the state. 
The case was adjourned to October 7 for further hearing.
