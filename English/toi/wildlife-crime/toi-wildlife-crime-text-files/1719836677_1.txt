Still, for confirmation, we will be sending a sample of the seized substance to the laboratory in Kolkata, as there is no laboratory in Maharashtra to conduct forensic analysis of Ambergris," they added.
"A first information report (FIR) has been registered against the three accused. They have been booked under sections 39,44, 49b, 51 57 of Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” they added.
Senior inspector of Murud said, “The three accused were produced before the Murud JMFC court on Tuesday and the magistrate has remanded them to police custody till January 13, as we have to interrogate them for finding their source of ambergris.”
