NEW DELHI: Five wildlife traffickers have been arrested and sent to 14-day judicial custody after they were caught by a joint team of Delhi forest department and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) for smuggling 2kg of Ambergris — a solid waxy substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales. 
Also known as floating gold, the substance is released by whales from their mouth as regurgitation, and can be used to make perfumes.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
A joint operation was conducted by members of the central forest division in Delhi along with WCCB, with officials stating that inputs were received that the group was hiding at a hotel in Paharganj.
“A join team conducted a raid and the five men were taken into custody from a Paharganj hotel. The substance is quite rare and is mostly used for its musky fragrance, which can be used for perfumes. It has natural properties, which means that the fragrance also lasts long,” said Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forest (central).

Further investigation is ongoing,” said the official, stating that the sperm whale was protected as entry 5-A in part II, schedule II of Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. “Their vehicle keys were also seized in order to look for more ‘uncured trophies’ they may be in possession of,” said the official.
