Musk deer and wild bison, categorised as endangered, are found only in the Himalayas, while the civet cat, found in TN, is also endangered as are sperm and pygmy sperm whales that are protected under Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act. People found in possession of extracts of these endangered animals are liable for severe punishment and can be booked under non-bailable sections, said the official. Wildlife crime control field operatives said of late, the demand for such material, especially the ambergris, is on the rise, sparking a spike in its illegal trade including through online portals, he said.
