NEW DELHI: Police have arrested two men for allegedly using monkeys to threaten a lawyer and snatch Rs 6,000 from him in south Delhi’s Khirki Extension last month. Cops have sent the two monkeys to a wildlife NGO.
The arrested accused have been identified as 26-year-old Balwan Nath and Vikram Nath (23), both residents of a slum cluster at Okhla Mor.
On March 2, a lawyer filed a complaint at Malviya Nagar police station saying that three men had approached him and snatched Rs 6,000 from him after unleashing monkeys on him.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Cops then registered a case of robbery. “During initial probe several CCTV footage were checked to identify the suspects. The suspects were identified and a manhunt was launched. Following a tip off on Thursday — that two of the suspects would come to Chirag Delhi bus stand with the monkeys — a raid was conducted and both of them were arrested,” the officer said.
“The arrested men confessed to the robbery and also revealed their third associate’s identity. They told cops that they had got the monkeys from Tughlaqabad Fort,” the officer said.
Further, the accused have also been booked under Wildlife Protection Act.
