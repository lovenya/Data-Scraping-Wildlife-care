The tenth batch of wildlife sniffer dog squad is now ready and prepared to protect India’s wildlife and stop illegal wildlife trade. Six wildlife sniffer dogs finished training under TRAFFIC and WWF-India’s wildlife sniffer dog training programme on April 1, Saturday. Now that the training is complete, four of them will join the forest departments of Karnataka, one will join in Bihar, and the other one in Madhya Pradesh, taking the total number of wildlife sniffer dogs trained under TRAFFIC and WWF-India's programme in India to 94.PollDo you believe in the concept of karma?NoYes
 The new recruits, six German Shepherds, and their 12 handlers had enrolled for the seven-month-long training at Basic Training Centre, Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (BTC-ITBP) camp in Panchkula, Haryana in September 2022. While the first few weeks of the training focus on developing an emotional and trusting bond between the dog and the handler, later, the dogs learn sniffing and tracking skills and become trained to detect tiger and leopard skins, bones and other body parts, bear bile, red sanders, and other illegal wildlife products.
Wildlife sniffer dogs play a crucial role in protecting the wildlife from crime and illegal trade. The illegal wildlife trade has endangered the existence of many wild species across the globe. Wildlife law enforcement practices are critical in containing this threat, and the use of wildlife sniffer dogs for wildlife crime prevention and detection has been a game changer in India.
