CHENNAI: Take immediate action to check elephant deaths in railway tracks or face the consequences, the Madras high court warned the union government and the railways on Friday.
“We would not mind summoning the highest official concerned and make them vicariously liable for the deaths of jumbos,” a division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Sathish Kumar said.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe court then directed the Centre to come up with a proper plan to prevent such incidents and protect the elephants by December 20. This apart, the court also appointed senior advocate P H Arvind Pandian as amicus curiae to assist the court in the issue.
The court passed the order while hearing a batch of PILs filed since 2016 to check elephant poaching and deaths due to train accidents.
When the pleas came up for hearing, the petitioners informed the court that in the last five years alone over 13,000 elephants have been killed in various such incidents.

The tribunal directed the committee to conduct a joint meeting with Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Southern Railways in this regard within one month. But nothing has been done so far, he added.
On February 10, the court ordered a probe by CBI based on a report filed by Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) that Tamil Nadu elephants were being poached by ‘culprits’ from other states and that no action was being taken against middlemen and kingpins.
Pointing out the death of at least eight elephants and recovery of 300kg ivory from the possession of criminals, the court wondered as to how only male elephants got ‘electrocuted’ and how such deaths happened despite the presence of a large number of field level forest personnel and their watchful eyes.
