New Delhi: In a first, over 50 forest and wildlife guards of the forest and wildlife department will undergo five-day training on impact of climate change on wildlife conservation. Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Combating Climate Change and Wildlife Trust of India have been roped in for the programme, which will also have sessions on wildlife crime. 
“Climate change has an effect on wildlife.For instance, wild animals come out of their habitat and go to human settlements due to their habitat destruction, which is linked to climate change. The training will help the staff in mitigating measures and steps to be taken in such circumstances,” said a senior forest official. 
Vipul Pandey, director of the institute, said, “Training will provide an exposure to wildlife staff about emerging challenges of climate change on wildlife management and to deal with them in a proper manner.” 
As the wildlife guards are involved in collecting intelligence, surveillance, conducting raids, seizures, arresting the accused and prosecuting the offenders by filing complaints in court, the programme will focus on various aspects of wildlife crime. “There will be separate sessions on different acts related to wildlife crime, including Wildlife Protection Act, 1972; sections of CrPC and Evidence Act. Delhi has reported many cases in the past years on smuggling of prohibited items of wildlife, the experts will also educate on investigation of such crimes,” said an official. 
The training, which scheduled to begin from next week, had been postponed due to Van Mahotsav. The new date is yet to be decided.
