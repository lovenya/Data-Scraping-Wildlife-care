CID police said they received information about the gang, which smuggled parakeets into the city through private buses from Chennai to Bengaluru. They would sell the parakeets to pet shops in the city and neighbouring districts. 
Further investigation revealed the accused used to procure parakeets from a person identified as Sameer in Tamil Nadu and supply them to other southern Indian states.
