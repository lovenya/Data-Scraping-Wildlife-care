The Union cabinet on Wednesday gave it approval for India adopting the statute of the network and becoming its formal member in order to strengthen ties with other member countries. 
“Adoption of SAWEN statute envisions India being part of the regional inter-governmental body in combating wildlife crime in the region and beyond”, said an official ahead of the conclusion of the ongoing 3rd Asian Ministerial Conference on tiger conservation.

The network will jointly work for bringing harmonization and standardization in laws and policies of member countries concerning conservation of fauna and flora. It will also document the trend of poaching and illegal trade, and related threats to the natural biodiversity within and across countries in the region.
The step is being taken as the South Asia region is very vulnerable to illegal trafficking and wildlife crimes due to precious biodiversity, large markets as well as trafficking routes for wildlife products. 
“The collaboration in harmonising as well as enforcing the wildlife protection in the region is considered very important for effective conservation of such precious biodiversity”, said the official note.
