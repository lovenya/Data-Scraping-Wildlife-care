CHENNAI: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India has released its latest findings about dogs being used for meat and wildlife meat markets in Northeast. The video documentation reveals filthy conditions risking disease transmission and rampant violations of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

At Nute Bazaar in Manipur, the flesh of barking deer, wild boars and frogs were illegally sold and buyers and sellers touched the charred animal parts with their bare hands. 
At Senapati Bazaar, an illegally hunted deer’s severed head was passed around. At markets in Nagaland, live eels, mice, frogs, and birds were openly sold and workers handled dead animals without wearing gloves.
Live dogs were also illegally sold for their meat – puppies were caged, and older dogs’ mouths were tied shut as they were offered for purchase and slaughter. At Itanagar market in Arunachal Pradesh, meat of mithun – the state animal – was openly sold.
“Filthy, illegal meat markets torture animals and act as petri dishes,” said PETA India advocacy associate Pradeep Ranjan Doley Barman. “We are calling on officials to do a sweep and shut them down, for everyone’s sake.”
These findings are particularly relevant as the Covid-19 pandemic is believed to have stemmed or spread from a live animal meat market. SARS, swine flu, and bird flu have also been linked to the practice of confining and killing animals for food. November is also World Vegan Month.
PETA India has sent letters to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change regarding these markets, urging them to take action.
