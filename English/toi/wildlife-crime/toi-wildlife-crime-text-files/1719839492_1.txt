NAGPUR: The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), a statutory body under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to combat organized wildlife crime, will introduce ‘Wildlife Volunteers’ scheme across the country to encourage the protection and conservation of wildlife.
WCCB regional deputy director (western region) M Maranko said, “The enrolled volunteers above 18 years of age will assist WCCB in gathering intelligence, capacity building and awareness.They will be enrolled after verifying their background and volunteer I-cards will be issued.” 
Keeping in view the enormity of the task, said Maranko, WCCB’s existing resources need to be augmented substantially in the long run. However, for its immediate requirement, the body has decided to enrol volunteers who have knowledge of wildlife crime issues.
The membership of these volunteers will be renewed every year and meetings held every three to six months. The volunteers will assist state forest departments in building awareness and the capacity of stakeholders for combating crime. They will also conduct public campaigns and programmes on wildlife laws and policies.
However, holding the position doesn’t entitle these volunteers to undertake any law enforcement actions directly. They will have to pass the information to the legally mandated enforcement agencies and assist the enforcement officers.
A four-member selection committee headed by the additional director of WCCB, Delhi, will select the volunteers on the basis of interviews. Tenure of these members will be two years and subject to renomination. It is a voluntary scheme and no honorarium will be paid.
