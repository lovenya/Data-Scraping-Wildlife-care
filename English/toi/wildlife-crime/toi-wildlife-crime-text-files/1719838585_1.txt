NEW DELHI: Delhi Forest and wildlife department is yet to deploy forest guards, rangers and inspectors as the department faces acute shortage of manpower even as a decade has passed.
According to officials, only 66 forests guards, a few rangers and two inspectors, appointed on contractual basis, currently serve in the department against the actual requirement of at least 211 guards, 11 wildlife guards, four rangers and seven inspectors. 
Tasked with the prevention the smuggling of wildlife articles, ensuring wildlife rescue, patrolling and preventing wildlife crimes to count a few, the absence of rangers, guards and inspectors has overburdened the current forest staff which says that vigilance is being affected in Delhi — a city that faces wildlife and environmental crimes, encroachments, etc often. 
“There is no disagreement of the fact that this exercise ought to have been completed by almost a decade and a half ago; the delay has possibly led to wanton tree-felling in the city, which loss could have been avoided had there been sufficient number of officers in the forest department,” stated the high court order dated May 5, 2022.

Officials stated that online tests of the guards were held in March and physical assessment is going on. However, the deployment will still take yet another year. Four candidates selected as rangers last year will only be deployed after an 18-months induction training. The high court had ordered to make available the requisite force to the department and by the time officials arrive “more damage would have been done to the trees and environment of Delhi”.
