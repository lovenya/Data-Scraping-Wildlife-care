Out of Himachal Pradesh’s198 cases,169 were about forests, 21 about wildlife, and 9 about noise. Punjab arrested 110 offenders in these cases in 2020 and charge-sheeted 98 of them. Haryana arrested 64 and charge-sheeted 59, while Himachal arrested 253 and charge-sheeted 338, adding many from the previous year.
Punjab recorded no offence for air and water pollution, as the state pollution control board reported these matters to the courts directly. Thousands of farmers burn their crop and almost all the water bodies of the state are contaminated, yet the NCRB recorded no case under the air and water laws. Even Himachal Pradesh recorded none of these cases, while Haryana registered five. In none of these states was any case recorded under the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010.
Confronted, Punjab Pollution Control Board member secretary Karunesh Garg told TOI: "We report air and water pollution not to police but straight to the court of judicial magistrate first class (JMIC). Since the NCRB collects its crime data from police, it has no record of air and water pollution, whereas we have filed 200 cases of stubble burning between April 2020 and this August 31. Earlier 350 cases of water pollution were pending and now the figure is 100.
