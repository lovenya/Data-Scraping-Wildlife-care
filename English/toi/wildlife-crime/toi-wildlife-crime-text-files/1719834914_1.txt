When Rukmani Devi Arundale founded the organisation in the 1960s, the then Union government granted her permission to have the headquarters in Chennai.
 A proposal to shift the was sent to the Union ministry of environment and forests and climate change at least three years ago, which has been approved by the ministry now, said an official.
The board has said that a regional centre will be formed in Chennai, which will function from the existing premises.
The fate of five honorary members two animal welfare activists, a forest official, an official from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, southern region and a member from the Censor Board in Tamil Nadu is hanging in the balance following the shift.
One of the members said they had not received any official communication from the board about the shifting or termination of their membership.
