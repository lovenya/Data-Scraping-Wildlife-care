HYDERABAD: A ‘Secret Service Fund’ to encourage informants to help curb forest crimes such as wildlife hunting, encroachments and smuggling would soon be set up by the state government, forest minister A Indrakaran Reddy said on Monday. 
Stating that the tiger poaching incident in Mulugu was very painful, Reddy told forest officials to ensure such incidents were not repeated.
Addressing forest officials and other stakeholders at a one-day workshop by Telangana state forest department at the Dr Marri Channa Reddy Human Resource Development Institute, the minister said that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has allocated Rs 4.06 crore for the ‘Secret Service Fund’.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
“The responsibility of forest officials has increased further in the wake of CM’s emphasis on curbing forest crimes. I urge officials to work in accordance with government’s objectives and sincerely carry out the responsibility of protecting forests,” the minister said. 
Principal conservator of forests R Shobha dubbed CM KCR as the brand ambassador of forest department, adding that no other state has given as much priority to forests as done by Telangana government.
