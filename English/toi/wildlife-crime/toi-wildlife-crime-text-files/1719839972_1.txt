But since the court was not satisfied with the development in the probe by the central agency, the special bench has now constituted the SIT.
The court passed the order in view of a report filed by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) that persons belonging to other states were also involved in the elephant poaching cases and that no action has been taken against the middlemen and the kingpins.
