PILIBHIT: The Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) and Wildlife Crime Control Unit (WCCU) of UP’s forest department have succeeded in curbing trafficking and poaching of turtles by rescuing over 9,000 turtles in a span of two-and- a-half months from four trade sensitive zones in Uttar Pradesh.
The wetlands between Etawah and Mainpuri districts were identified as one of the most vulnerable turtle trade sensitive zones, where more than 3,500 turtles were rescued.The other three zones are between Pilibhit and Kheri, Sultanpur and Amethi and Unnao-Kanpur.
According to India programme director of TSA Shailendra Singh, this outcome was a result of a series of special search and seizure operations conducted jointly by TSA and WCCU in UP in active coordination with the special task force (STF).
Now, a training session is to be held in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve in the second week of February to step up the crackdown against poaching.

With a view to giving this plan a practical shape, a meeting of TSA and GSI officials was held on January 25 in the Sundarbans,” said Singh.
“When the turtles are rescued, it becomes essential for us to release them in their original habitats to let their population grow without genetic barriers. The plan envisages collection of genetic material to find out the exact location of natural habitats of rescued turtles,” Singh said.
