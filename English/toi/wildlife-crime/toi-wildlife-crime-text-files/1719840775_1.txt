AGRA: The response to an RTI query has revealed that at least 57 tigers were killed by poachers across the country in the last 10 years. Between January 2013 and December 2022, 254 persons were arrested for allegedly poaching the big cats from 13 states including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, according to the information provided by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) in response to the query filed by a TOI correspondent last month.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAs per the data, most tigers were killed in Madhya Pradesh. Meanwhile, so far in 2023 (80 days), 43 cases of tiger mortality have been reported by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). As per the conditions set by NTCA, all tiger deaths are at first presumed to be due to poaching. However, based on data by NTCA, the majority of tiger deaths are eventually linked to natural causes like territorial fights and ageing.
According to NTCA, a total of 121 tiger deaths occurred in 2022, 127 in 2021,106 in 2020, 96 in 2019, 101 in 2018, 117 in 2017, 121 in 2016, 82 in 2015, 78 in 2014, 68 in 2013 and 88 in 2012. Notably, NTCA reports showed a higher number of tiger deaths (193) due to poaching in the 2012-2020 period as compared to data provided by WCCB, which also has powers to conduct raids and arrest people involved in wildlife crime. The database since January 2021 is not yet available.
A senior state forest and wildlife official on the condition of anonymity said, "Poaching is a big threat to the existence of big cats. Their body parts are in relentless demand for folk remedies and are even considered a 'status symbol' in some Asian countries. Their pelts are one of the most valuable items on the black market."
However, what is even more worrying is that convictions have happened in only 4% cases against poachers in India, the official said.
