"Sale and purchase of monitor lizards and its organs is a criminal offence as the animal is listed under Schedule-1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Acting on tip-off, we raided the house. Veterinary experts of Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) examined the seized products and confirmed that the dried sexual organs belonged to monitor lizards," special director general (crime) B K Sharma told TOI. 
Sources said monitor lizard is high in demand in different states and abroad for its meat, oil and fat that are used in traditional medicines for treating bone fracture, chronic pain and other ailments. 
"We are trying to estimate the value of the seized wildlife products. We are also trying to know about the use of the dried sexual organs of the lizards. Prima facie, we learnt the wildlife organs were being traded online. We are trying to know the source from where Joshi procured the monitor lizards," Sharma said.
Official sources said the smugglers buy each monitor lizard for Rs 2,000 and sell them for Rs 6,000 or more. The cost depends on the weight of the lizard.
