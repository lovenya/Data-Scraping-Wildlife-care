KOLKATA: In its continuing efforts to curb wildlife trade, the Border Security Force (BSF) on Thursday nabbed a Bangladeshi smuggler with 17 exotic birds in the Bhimpur police station area of Nadia. 
The birds, packed in three cages, were later identified as Toucan Vectors (2), Aracari Toucan Vectors (5) and Poicephalus Cryptoxanthus (10). All of them fetch a hefty price in the underground wildlife markets in cities like Kolkata -- frequented by collectors of exotic species.
"Around 10.35pm, when troops of the 81Bn BSF posted at the Rangiapota BOP were patrolling the Indo-Bangladesh border, they noticed a scuffle at a nearby village and rushed there.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoIn the village, they found that the locals had cornered a Bangladeshi national with the three cages of birds. The smuggler was later identified as Azmat Musarif (45), of the Kullu Jugirpara village in the Chaudanga district of Bangladesh. During interrogation, Musarif said that he had crossed the border along with Dolu of Kapashdanga and Rabiul (also from Jugirpara). Dolu was apparently the owner of these birds, but managed to escape with Rabiul after the scuffle alerted the border troopers," a senior BSF official said. 
Musarif further claimed that he was merely a courier and the consignment was to be delivered to one Gopal Baag of Bhimpur. He was to receive Rs 5,000 for his efforts. Senior BSF officials have complimented villagers for resisting such smuggling attempts across the international border. Wildlife enthusiasts have sought stronger laws to curb smuggling off such species across international borders.
