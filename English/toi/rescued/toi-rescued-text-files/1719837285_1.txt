BHOPAL: Thirty hours into the mission to save a six-year-old boy who fell into an open borewell in MP's Rewa district, rescuers worked all through Friday night but were yet to catch a glimpse of the boy or hear him.
Mayank Kol fell into the borewell while playing with friends. A CCTV camera was lowered into the tunnel but the boy could not be seen. Oxygen is being pumped into the borewell to help him breathe.
Rescuers dug a 42-feet-deep parallel tunnel and struck water at a depth of 40 feet Saturday.They believe Mayank is stuck about 40 feet down the 70-feet borewell, in Manika village, 630 km from Bhopal.
What complicates the rescue, apart from unseasonal rain, is that the borewell is 'kuccha' & soil keeps falling off.
