As per the story of ‘Ashtami’, people of Nabogram worship their age-old myth of a local deity known as Bourani. The villagers believe that on a particular day, Bourani possesses her greatest devotee, answers prayers, and warns of impending dangers. Bourani’s vessel used to be the head priest once upon a time, but since his mysterious disappearance a couple of decades ago – the zamindar of the region Purushottam, seems to be the chosen one. Ashtami arrives in Nabogram and quickly realizes that the simple locals were being hoodwinked and taken advantage of, by Purushottam, who poses as a Godman. Ashtami becomes a thorn in Purushottam's side. Purushottam plans to stop Ashtami by hook or crook and that leads to an accident that leaves Ashtami visually impaired.
