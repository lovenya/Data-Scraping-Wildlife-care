"Some 25 people have been killed and eight injured," said Janan Sayeq in a video clip shared with media.

However, Adel also said, "snow had blocked one of the main roads into the province, making the rescue operation difficult." 
The avalanche hit Nakre village in the Tatin valley of Nuristan resulting in the burial of homes under snow and debris. Approximately 20 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged.
