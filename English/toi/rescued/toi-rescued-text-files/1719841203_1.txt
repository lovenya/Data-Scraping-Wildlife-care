KASARAGOD: Two youths in Kerala's Kasaragod district had a miraculous escape after their car, using Google Maps for navigation, drove into a swollen river and got stuck to a tree, allowing them to call for help. Their rescue by Fire Force personnel, captured on video, has since gone viral on social media.
The incident occurred as the two were on their way to a hospital in Karnataka in the early hours.They were navigating with the help of Google Maps when they encountered the river on Pallanchi, which had overflowed due to heavy rains. Abdul Rasheed, one of the youths in the car, explained that Google Maps directed them onto a narrow road.
"Using the vehicle's headlight, we felt that there was some water in front of us. But, we didn't see that there was a river on both sides and a bridge in the middle. There was also no sidewall for the bridge," Rasheed said.
The car was swept away by the water currents but eventually got lodged in a tree on the riverbank. The youths managed to open the car door, exit the vehicle, and send their location to the Fire Force personnel. The rescue team arrived quickly and pulled both men to safety using ropes.

Last month, a group of tourists from Hyderabad drove into a swollen stream near Kuruppanthara in Kottayam apparently after using Google Maps.
All four managed to escape unharmed due to the efforts of a nearby police patrol unit and local residents, but their vehicle was completely submerged.
