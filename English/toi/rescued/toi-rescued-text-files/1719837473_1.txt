SRINAGAR: A local worker who went missing after a portion of the Thajwas glacier broke off from the main ice mass and collapsed on him and two tourists, was found dead Monday. The tourist duo, meanwhile, was rescued late Sunday.
The deceased was identified as Manzoor Ahmad Khan, a resident of Hakar Gund, who worked as a sledge-rider in the tourist destination of Sonamarg in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
On Sunday afternoon, Khan and the two tourists fell into Nallah Sindh in the impact of the collapse following a rush of tourists in the area. While the tourist duo was saved in a subsequent rescue operation, Khan couldn’t be traced. His body was recovered Monday after an intensive search, police said.
This is the second such accident in Sonamarg in less than 10 days. On May 25, a tourist from Maharashtra died while his wife sustained injuries when the duo accidentally fell into a snow cavity after a portion of the glacier in Sonamarg broke suddenly.
