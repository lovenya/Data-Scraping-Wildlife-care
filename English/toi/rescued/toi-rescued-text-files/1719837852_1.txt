SYDNEY: Marine wildlife experts were frantically trying to rescue some 140 pilot whales stranded on Thursday in the shallow waters of an estuary south of the state of Western Australia.
The whales are stranded at Toby Inlet in Geographe Bay, the Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions said. The area is near the town of Dunsborough in the southwestern region popular with tourists, and about 236 km (146 miles) south of state capital Perth.
"We understand there are four pods of up to 160 pilot whales in total spread across about 500 metres.PollWhich is the most important WhatsApp new feature for you?Ask Meta AIMultiple account supportBetter storage managementChat filtersUnfortunately, 26 whales that stranded on the beach have died," a department spokesperson said in a statement.

In July last year, more than 50 pilot whales died after stranding on a remote Western Australia beach.
Pilot whales are known for their tight-knit social bonds, so when one gets into difficulty and strands, the rest often follow, according to the University of Western Australia.
