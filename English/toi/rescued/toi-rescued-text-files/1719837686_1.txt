Panaji:Anjuna police on Saturday rescued a 25-year-old Kenyan woman who was allegedly pushed into the sex trade after being lured by agents who promised her a job in the hospitality industry.
A long-running international sex racket involves educated Kenyan women being lured by agents who orchestrate the ruse of ‘hospitality jobs’. They complete all the documentation for the women to come to India, and even sometimes buy the tickets, police said.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe racket is run from Kenya.
Anjuna PI Prashal Desai said that a year ago, the Kenyan national was brought to Bengaluru and was pushed into the sex trade. Immediately after she landed in India, the agent took her passport and forced her into prostitution. After six months in Bengaluru, she was moved to Goa. 
First, she stayed at Siolim, and later she was shifted to Mandrem.

The agent handed over the passport of the Kenyan national to those women, and left for Bengaluru. 
After a few days, one of the victims handed over the passport to the Kenyan woman, and requested her not to run away as they would fall into trouble.
Police said that when the woman got her passport, she approached the NGO Arz. Anjuna police then rescued the woman.
