Panaji: The Indian Coast Guard reviewed the Maritime Search and Rescue (M-SAR) protocols with the local stakeholders including the fisheries department, the Mormugao Port Authority (MPA), the captain of ports (COP), and coastal security police (CSP). The aim of the exercise was to brush up and validate existing search and rescue procedures and improve coordination with all stakeholders.
Deputy inspector general, Goa, Manoj Bhatia said that the initiative is meant to improve coordination and readiness among various agencies.
“We recently rescued 24 tourists from a boat that was stranded in the rough seas. These incidents keep coming up,” Bhatia said. 
“I would request boat operators to look beyond profit generation. Life is precious and once lost, it is lost...it impacts the entire economy.” he further said.
