Since the bodies of humans and monkeys are very similar, I tried to revive the monkey while my colleagues protected me from an agitated troupe. I pumped the chest for almost 45 minutes with intermittent rubbing and pouring little amounts of water into the mouth and finally it revived." He added, "The monkey comes to the police station daily and I'm happy to see him playing."

Veterinarian Dr Hari Om Sharma said, "The monkey suffered a heat stroke and fainted due to dehydration. Timely help saved its life. After it became conscious, we administered an antibiotic."
