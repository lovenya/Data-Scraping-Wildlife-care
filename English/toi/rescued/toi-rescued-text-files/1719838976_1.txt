RAMANAGARA: Police and child welfare committee (CWC) members rescued a 10-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy who were allegedly being tortured by their alcoholic father in Kudur of Magadi taluk.
Police and the CWC members were shocked to see burn marks on the two children, who said their father had caused them.
Their mother had died a few years ago and the father was reluctant to take care of them, neighbours told police.The children's paternal grandmother took care of them, but she was helpless in stopping her son from beating and tormenting the kids, police said.
"A few days back, the father branded the son and the daughter and poured hot water on them. Unable to bear the pain, the children started crying and the neighbours rushed in. The father abused them, saying it was his family matter and they should not intervene. However, the neighbours took the children to their home and alerted police and the children's helpline," an investigating officer said. 
"The man (accused) is an alcoholic and thinks that the two children are a financial burden on him," the police officer added.
