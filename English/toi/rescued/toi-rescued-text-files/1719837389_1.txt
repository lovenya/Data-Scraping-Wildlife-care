“The ICG ship C-148, which was returning from patrol, noticed signs of distress among the passengers aboard the boat and responded swiftly. Braving the rough seas, the ICG vessel reached the distressed boat and averted a major casualty. The team stabilised the situation and brought the boat safely to Mormugao harbour. Upon arrival, all the passengers and crew members were provided with medical aid,” said an ICG official. 
The India meteorological department (IMD) had issued a warning against venturing into the sea owing to adverse weather conditions.
