KOLKATA: Two persons were rescued by emergency services personnel when the staircase of a century-old building - declared insecure and highly unsafe - on Pathuriaghata Street collapsed on Friday night. Prabha Devi Singh (48) and Biswamitra Upadhyay (36) survived with no injuries. But the incident brought to fore the challenges being faced by the civic body to move out inhabitants from insecure buildings dotting central and north Kolkata localities.
Police said the incident took place around 8.40 pm, when a portion of the now three-storied building collapsed. The incident prompted personnel from Jorabagan PS, fire, CESC and police's disaster management group to dash there. After the two trapped residents were rescued, senior state minister Shashi Panja went to the spot. She said, "None was injured. We are making temporary arrangements for those affected. I know the first question that comes to your mind is 'where will I go?' But safety is paramount. I have apprised the situation to mayor Firhad Hakim." 
According to sources, the old building was originally a G+4 structure. Till 2020, multiple notices were given to the owner and residents that this building is highly insecure. But they didn't leave. "In April 2021, we received a plan from the owner and residents that they will build a G+7 structure on the plot by demolishing the old building. The vertical increase of three floors was allowed based on an undertaking that the residents will be accommodated in the same building. This is based on the revised FAR as per KMC rules to address such issues. While all agreed to relocate to their temporary addresses (in Sovabazar), four families on first and second floors refused," an officer said. Meanwhile, KMC had started demolishing the upper portions of the building.
When the incident happened, two persons on second floor were trapped. The residents alleged that piling work being carried out in a local under-counstruction high-rise had led to the collapse.
