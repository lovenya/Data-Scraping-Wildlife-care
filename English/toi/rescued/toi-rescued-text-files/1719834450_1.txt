In a tragic set of events, former Zimbabwe cricketer Guy Whittall survived an attack by a leopard while on a trek in the Humani region wher he runs a conservancy, according a report in 'Daily Mail'.
Whittall's pet dog, Chikara, fought the leopard and was even bitten by the big cat in an act that saved the 51-year-old Whittall. 
The news was confirmed by Whittall's wife, Hannah, who posted images on social media of her husband with bandages on.PollHas Virat Kohli taken the right decision to announce retirement from T20Is?YesNoThe former all-rounder was later airlifted to Harare for surgical treatment of his wounds. 

"He really is one lucky man, first he had the crocodile and now the leopard, he really is the cat with nine lives. He was so fortunate that Chikara was there to help him and get the leopard off him, otherwise who knows how it might have ended," Hannah was quoted as saying by Daily Mail. 
The pet dog also received treatment at a veterinary hospital.
Whittall was in the news for a wild encounter with a crocodile a few years back, as the eight-feet beast was strangely found sleeping under his bed at home.

"We are so grateful to him, and Chikara going to get some extra chicken as a treat. He's got to see the vet as he has a few scratches and but he should be okay, he's in better shape than Guy.
"Fortunately, Guy is up in bed and talking, he's telling anyone who will listen how he wrestled with a leopard but we all know it was down to Chikara," she said.
