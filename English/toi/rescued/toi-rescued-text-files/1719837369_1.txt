Queen of Tears has been winning hearts with the electrifying chemistry between Kim Soo-hyun and Kim Ji-won adding to the engaging narrative. The latest episode of the tvN drama saw Yoon Eun-sung (portrayed by Park Sung-hoon) invited Hong Hae-in (played by Kim Ji-won) to his residence.
Yoon addressed Hong Hae-in's discomfort at the dinner table, acknowledging her unease and offering reassurance in response, “You have to give me time.Time to clear up the misunderstanding you have.” He retrieved a necklace belonging to Hong from her childhood, tenderly presenting it to her with heartfelt words, “Do you remember this? It was yours a long time ago.” Upon glimpsing the necklace, memories flooded back for Hong Hae-in, reminding her of a childhood incident when a young Yoon Eun-sung had bravely rescued her from a menacing dog near Queens' nursery school. Touched by the gesture, she turned to him and inquired about the event, prompting a tender exchange between the two, “That was you? Then was the first time we met?”
Yoon Eun-sung revealed his identity as the boy who had rescued Hae-in and her brother from a perilous sea incident in the past, confiding in her with heartfelt sincerity, “The first time I met you was before that. I have liked you since the,” confessing his long-standing crush on her.
