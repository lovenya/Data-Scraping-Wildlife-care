DC Shangla mentioned that rehabilitation work on roads had commenced, with rubble being cleared from main roads initially, followed by the clearance of link roads to facilitate traffic flow.
However, challenges persist, as Zahid Kathana from Dubair in Lower Kohistan highlighted how makeshift roads and bridges had been repeatedly washed away by flash floods for the fifth time since 2010, forcing residents to remain confined to their homes. The dire situation compelled locals to transport patients to hospitals using makeshift arrangements, enduring arduous journeys through the rugged terrain.
Although the water level in the rivers has receded following the cessation of rain, PDMA has initiated relief activities in the affected districts of KP.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasts continued rainfall across the country until April 22, as another strong westerly wave is expected to enter the western regions. This wave is anticipated to affect Balochistan initially before extending to the upper parts of the country.
The PMD's predictions include heavy rainfall, windstorms, and thunderstorms in various regions, with isolated areas likely to experience very heavy falls. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, districts such as Chitral, Dir, Swat, Abbottabad, and others are expected to be affected, with occasional gaps in the weather pattern.
Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir are also bracing for inclement weather conditions, including rain, thunderstorms, and snowfall in high mountainous areas, while areas in Punjab and Sindh are advised to prepare for potential rainfall, windstorms, and hailstorms.
The PMD has warned of flash flooding in certain areas, along with the risk of landslides in the upper KP, Murree, Galiyat, Kashmir, and GB. Farmers are advised to take precautions to protect their crops, and authorities have been urged to remain vigilant and take necessary measures to mitigate any potential risks.
The National Highways and Motorway Police have advised the public to avoid unnecessary travel during this period, in accordance with the PMD's advisory, to ensure safety amid the challenging weather conditions, Dawn reported.
