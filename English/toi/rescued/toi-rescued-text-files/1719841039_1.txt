NEW DELHI: A dog helped his owner get rescued after a car accident in the mountains of northeastern Oregon in US. Brandon Garrett was traveling with his four dogs on a secluded US Forest Service road on June 2, when his vehicle veered off the path and crashed into a deep ravine, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a news release on Facebook.
One of the dogs named Blue, managed to make its way to the campsite where the man's family was staying, covering a distance of nearly four miles, which alerted them that something was wrong.
"Blue's appearance prompted Brandon Garrett's family and friends to search for him during the night of June 2 and the next morning," the Baker County Sheriff's Office said.
The following day, the family located the Brandon's car but was unable to reach it due to the treacherous terrain and promptly called 911 for assistance.

Despite his injuries, Brandon had managed to crawl out of the car after the crash. 
To reach the stranded individual, US Forest Service personnel used chainsaws to clear a path through the dense vegetation, allowing search and rescue teams to set up an intricate rope system that spanned the width of the ravine.
Once the rescue team reached the man, they secured him in a rescue stretcher and attached it to the ropes. The ropes were then utilised as a pulley system to safely transport Brandon across the ravine, with a raging stream flowing beneath them. 
The sheriff's office shared photos documenting the complex rescue operation. The man was then airlifted to a regional hospital for medical treatment, while his three other dogs were found alive at the crash site.
