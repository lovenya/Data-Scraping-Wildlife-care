COIMBATORE: A 33-year-old techie, the mother of the baby who fell on a temporary sunshade of an apartment in Chennai recently and was rescued, died by suicide on Saturday at her parent's house in Coimbatore. Her family said she was dealing with depression after the child's birth and was undergoing counselling.
The deceased, V Ramya, has a five-year-old son besides the seven-month-old daughter with her husband Venkatesh.
Ramya died by suicide when her parents were out to attend a house warming ceremony on Friday. Her husband and children were home.
Last month, while Ramya was playing with her daughter in the balcony of her fourth floor house in Chennai, the baby landed on a sunshade. Residents had rescued her. A probe is on into Ramya's death.
