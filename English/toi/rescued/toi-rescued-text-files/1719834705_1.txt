Bengaluru: A nearly four-year-old terrapin, a turtle species, is moving around at a rescue centre in Kengeri. Its shell is held together by cloth hooks and wires.
The 550-gram turtle has been on a long road to recovery ever since experts at PfA Wildlife Rescue & Conservation Centre, Kengeri, found it with a fractured shell near Nice Road toll, off Kanakapura Road, and rescued it on Oct 28.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“The Indian pond terrapin was in severe pain and its movements were very sluggish. It had a mild fungal infection in the wound and wouldn’t eat,” said Col (Dr) Navaz Shariff, chief veterinarian, PfA Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Centre.
Terrapins usually end up on the road in search of a mate or food in other waterbodies and tend to be run over by vehicles, he added.
Due to its size and fragile shell, traditional methods of shell repair like titanium plates and screws weren’t viable options, veterinarians said.

The terrapin underwent gaseous anaesthesia, and in a four-hour surgery, doctors used cloth hooks and wires to delicately realign the fractured shell, employing epoxy putty to secure the hooks in place.
“This innovative technique allowed us to provide the terrapin with the support it needed to heal while minimizing the risk of further damage. It is showing remarkable signs of recovery, displaying a hearty appetite and an unwavering spirit," said Dr Jayant, adding the turtle will soon roam free.
