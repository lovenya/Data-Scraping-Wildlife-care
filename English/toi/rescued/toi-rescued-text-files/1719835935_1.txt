My faith in Allah has increased more than ever after my son came out alive after remaining stuck under the debris of the collapsed five-storied building for 10 hours straight. I can't believe how lucky I am.
My son, Salahuddin Gaji, is a bright boy who has finished his senior school and is now pursuing computer studies. On Sunday night, he had gone out for a brief chat with his friends at the under-construction building and had promised to come back fast and have dinner with me.
I was waiting for him when I received a call from one of his friends.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoIt was Salahuddin's voice who was crying. He told me: "Ammi maaf kar do.. Mere liye dua karna" (Mother, please forgive me. Do pray for me), while telling me he was stuck in the debris and there was no way he could get out on his own.
I rushed to the spot, called my husband and camped outside the building the whole time. Since he was still connected over the phone, he kept on calling me time and again. I told cops and DMG personnel that my son could be contacted over phone. They called him to know the details about those trapped, and the amount of oxygen inside to hasten up the rescue process.

But my prayers were answered as the rain was limited to a drizzle and my son could finally be pulled out around 10am. He has suffered severe injuries on his legs and pelvis but doctors have said he is stable and is out of danger.
