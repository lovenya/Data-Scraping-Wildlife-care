NEW DELHI: In a swift operation that saw an IAF aircraft land in the high-altitude region of Leh using night-vision goggles, an Army soldier with a severed hand was evacuated to Delhi from a forward area in a "dark night airlift".
The jawan underwent a complex nine-hour surgery at Army Hospital for "re-implantation" of his left hand. 
The soldier was stationed in Ladakh when his hand got severed while operating a machine on April 9.Fellow soldiers tied a band on his arm to stem the bleeding, put the severed limb in an ice bag, and rushed him to Leh's Military Garrison Hospital.
"Doctors there stabilised the jawan's condition but recognised the need for specialised surgery, which wasn't available locally. Given a window of 8 hours for the surgery to stitch his severed limb, Army contacted IAF, which dispatched a C-130J Hercules aircraft from Hindon air base. The C-130J carried out a night landing at Leh airfield using night vision equipment to evacuate the jawan," an official said.
