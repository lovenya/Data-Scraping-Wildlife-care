Police will also conduct an awareness campaign in schools, colleges, and public places to discourage people from giving alms to child beggars,” the statement added. 
Under the initiative, police will take immediate legal action against those found forcing children to beg on the streets. Since 2017, police have rescued 7,670 children, of which 3,603 have been enrolled in schools, while the rest have been united with their families. tnn
