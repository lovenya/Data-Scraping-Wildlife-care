HYDERABAD: Investigation into the sale of an infant in Hyderabad recently blew the lid off an inter-state child trafficking racket, leading to arrest of eight persons on Tuesday and rescue of 11 children, aged between 23 days and three years, from different parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
The operation was conducted by Rachakonda police after three persons, who were part of the racket, were arrested earlier this month.
According to police, the children were trafficked through 'suppliers' operating out of Delhi and Pune, and sold to childless couples in the two southern states. So far, the gang has trafficked over 50 children and sold them for up to Rs 6 lakh.
A hunt is still on for the 'suppliers', said police, adding that they were yet to ascertain how these children entered this illegal market. "All the rescued children are in good health. Five more trafficked children have been located in Vijayawada (Andhra), and we are in the process of rescuing them," said Tarun Joshi, CP Rachakonda.

Police handed over the children to state woman and child development department. They will be kept at govt child care homes.
Cops said the Hyderabad-based operators of the racket approached childless couples and offered to help them for a handsome amount. 
"Once the deal was struck, the suppliers in Delhi and Pune were contacted. They then shared photographs of some children through WhatsApp with the city-based gang, which in turn, forwarded the pictures to the couples, asking them to take a pick," police said.
"Once full payment was made, the local agents would then travel to Delhi or Pune, and bring the children through various means of transport," police further added.
