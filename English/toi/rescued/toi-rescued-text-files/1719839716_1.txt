ALWAR: Two sanitation workers among three people died and two others were critically injured after inhaling toxic gases in a septic tank in a village in Bharatpur district on Thursday around 7.30am. Akash (25) and Karan (22), hired by Indal Singh, felt suffocated in the tank and cried for help, prompting Indal and his two neighbours, Bholu Sharma (34) and Naresh Sharma, to try to pull them out.
But the wooden slab they were standing on caved in, plunging all three down into the 30-feet-deep tank, said Dinesh, a neighbour in Nagla Mai village.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
