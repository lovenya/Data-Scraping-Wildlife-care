NEW DELHI: A Polish daredevil was arrested in Buenos Aires Tuesday as he tried to scale a 30-storey building without ropes, only to be removed by firefighters.
Marcin Banot, dressed in an Argentine football jersey, was intercepted by the onlookers gathered below when he had climbed 25 floors of the Globant building.
More than 30 firefighters, ambulances and police cars were rushed to the scene after someone inside the building called an emergency line.
The firefighters brought him down -- an attempt which the man did not resist.

The 36-year-old has attempted similar stunts in several nations and has hundreds of thousands of followers on social networks.
He had already tried to climb the same building last week, but was prevented by police.
