The deceased were identified as Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, hailing from Mexico and Guatemala respectively.
The crew, hailing from multiple Central American nations, were part of a construction crew involved in repairing potholes on the bridge when the vessel collided with it, leading to the tragic incident.
Search and rescue efforts have been hindered by the debris, with authorities exhausting all means in trying to locate the remaining missing workers. The Baltimore region now grapples with the loss of a critical transportation link, which has prompted the closure of the port, a significant artery for the city's shipping industry.

Marcel Muise, the NTSB investigator leading the inquiry, outlined a timeline leading up to the collision based on voyage data recordings, indicating multiple alarms and steering commands just moments before the crash.
The vessel, carrying hazardous materials, including corrosives and lithium-ion batteries, was bound for Sri Lanka. The collision has not only claimed lives but also raised concerns about potential environmental hazards from the breached containers.
With the bridge out of commission and port operations suspended indefinitely, the city faces significant disruptions in both transportation and commerce. The impact extends beyond local borders, affecting national supply chains and consumer goods distribution.
Efforts are underway to clear the wreckage and restore operations, with authorities emphasizing the importance of thorough investigation and safety protocols to prevent such incidents in the future. As the city mourns the lives lost, the focus shifts towards rebuilding and safeguarding critical infrastructure to prevent similar tragedies from occurring again.
