KOLKATA: A group of 11 students from Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri Law College and a few other colleges who were stranded in heavy snowfall at Himachal Pradesh finally managed to reach Shimla after surviving on biscuits and water for 11 days. The students' families, who were extremely worried, were relieved to learn that they were safe.
"The snowfall began after we left Shimla and reached Rakcham - a small village between Sangla and Chitkul.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoSnowfall and snowstorm continued throughout the day. It was the beginning of our ordeal. We had never imagined such a situation," said Nayab Ashraf, a student of the law college and a resident of Mominpur.
"Our car got stuck in the snow at Malling Nala and we had to spend the night on the road in the freezing cold. At times, we lost hope of ever getting back. There was no money and we had to survive on biscuits and water," Nayab said. Officials said that the group was rescued after they managed to reach Pooh, a town in Kinnaur.
