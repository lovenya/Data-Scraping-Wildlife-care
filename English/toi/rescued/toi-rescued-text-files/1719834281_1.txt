Vasco: A 53-year-old Mexican national, Fernando Cruz Mendez, was evacuated by the Indian Coast Guard after he suffered a heart attack aboard a cruise vessel. Mendez was later brought to Goa for treatment.
The incident occurred on Monday night around 40km off Goa's coast.
Mendez complained of chest pain aboard the cruise liner 'Celebrity Millennium' that was en route to Mumbai from Goa. 
Officials onboard the vessel immediately contacted the Indian Coast Guard around 7.25pm.

The coast guard vessel rendezvoused with the cruise vessel at around 9.30pm. Mendez was shifted to the coast guard vessel along his wife and a medical attendant. 
Mendez's vitals were monitored as the Indian Coast Guard vessel raced to the port and arrived at the Mormugao port around 11.30pm. 
He was transferred to a waiting ambulance and rushed to a private hospital at Chicalim. 
"It was a remarkable display of skill, dedication, and collaborative efforts. A medical evacuation at sea was successfully executed by the Indian Coast Guard Ship C-158," said deputy inspector general Manoj Bhatia who has recently taken charge as commandant of Goa headquarters.
