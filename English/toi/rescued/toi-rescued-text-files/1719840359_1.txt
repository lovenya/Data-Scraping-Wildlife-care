NEW DELHI: Nearly 1,400 girl students escaped from a school building engulfed by fire in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Monday. Rescue officials reported that the fire swept through the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Haripur district's Sirikot village while hundreds of students were inside.
Rescue officials said that fire brigade vehicles faced difficulties reaching the site due to the mountainous terrain.
Haripur's rescue 1122 spokesperson, Faraz Jalal, confirmed that all students were safely evacuated from the building. The spokesperson noted that the fire caused significant damage to the entire school, which was partially constructed with wood. The rescue department confirmed no loss of life.
Chief secretary Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, said that the fire was caused by a short circuit and an investigation into the incident is underway.
