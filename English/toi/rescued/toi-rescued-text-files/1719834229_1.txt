Trichy: Modern equipment will be procured to make rescue operations during emergencies easier, director general of police and director of fire & rescue services department Abhash Kumar has said. He was speaking to reporters in Trichy after giving away prizes and certificates to winners of the state-level inter-departmental sports meet held in Trichy for fire and rescue services personnel on Sunday.
“We are in the process of modernizing our equipment. We already have drones in our department. Further, it has been planned to procure robots, earthmovers and tractors. As we don’t have fibre boats, we are going to purchase them to be used to rescue people during floods,” he said.
He said it was a matter of pride for the department that the chief minister appreciated the excellent work done by the department when the flood devastated Chennai and the southern districts. 
On the continuing tragedies at firecracker units, the DGP said the govt is taking steps to avert such accidents.
