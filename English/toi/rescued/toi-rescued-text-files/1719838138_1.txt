“Onlookers said Meena first threw her child into the river and then she and her mother jumped in. Atul jumped in later. Two Vasna policemen were at the spot and jumped into the river and rescued the child first,” a fire brigade officer said.

They took off their saris and dived into the river to save the others. Two forest guards also plunged in to help with the rescue,” the officer said.
A Sabarmati Riverfront (West) police officer said Meena had a domestic dispute with her husband, Naveen Chavda, against whom she had filed an FIR for domestic violence around six months ago.
“After being rescued and given treatment, Meena told police that Naveen would beat her and the other members of her family over trivial matters. Tormented, she decided to end her life along with her child, brother and mother,” an officer of Sabarmati Riverfront (West) police said.
