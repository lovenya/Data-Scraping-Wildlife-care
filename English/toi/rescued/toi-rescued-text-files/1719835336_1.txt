A 54-year-old woman from Adoor in Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district, who was running to escape from a wild boar charging at her, fell into an abandoned well where she remained neck-deep for nearly 22 hours before being rescued. Elizabeth Babu was collecting grass to feed her cow on Monday, when the boar came running and hit her. She ran and tried to climb atop wooden planks laid across the mouth of a well on the premises of her house.The planks gave way, plunging her 50ft below.
After failing to locate her, Elizabeth’s husband filed a police complaint Tuesday. Fire and rescue personnel saved the woman, who was later admitted to hospital.
