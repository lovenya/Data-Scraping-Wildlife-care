KOTTAYAM: A group of four tourists from Hyderabad found themselves drove their vehicle into a stream swollen with water near Kuruppanthara in the southern district of Kerala. Unfamiliar with the area and relying on Google Maps for navigation, they failed to notice that the road they were on was submerged due to heavy rains and the overflowing stream.The incident took place late Friday night.
Fortunately, the quick actions of a nearby police patrol unit and local residents ensured that all four individuals escaped unharmed. However, their vehicle was completely submerged under the water. "Efforts are on to pull it out," said an officer from the Kaduthuruthy police station.
This incident is not an isolated case in Kerala. In October of the previous year, two young doctors lost their lives in a car accident after allegedly following directions provided by Google Maps, which led them to fall into a river. In response to that tragedy, the Kerala police issued cautionary guidelines for using such technology during the monsoon season, emphasizing the need for extra caution and awareness of local conditions.
