FRANKFURT: A firefighter died while trying to rescue residents trapped by major flooding in southern Germany after heavy rain that was expected to continue throughout Sunday.
 The man, 42, was in a rescue boat carrying four firefighters that capsized late on Saturday. His body was recovered early on Sunday, said a spokesperson for the Bavarian town of Pfaffenbach an der Ilm, around 50 km (30 miles) north of Munich.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
 While municipalities had days to prepare for the flooding, rescue workers still had to evacuate hundreds of people as the water cut off some areas, authorities said.
 "We owe our thanks and respect to the rescue workers and helpers who are battling the consequences of the floods in many places," Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X.
