Here is practical. This person even after warning provoked an adult Guar - putting everybody in danger. Gaur went into residential area. Happened before our team reached. Our teams reached & rescued the animal. With much difficulty though. Don’t provoke Wildlife unnecessarily. It is dangerous."
In another post, Kaswan wrote, "Every wildlife has a safe distance. When you breach that they feel threatened. And animals like gaurs are neurotic, they behave in confusing way. Which results in injury to wildlife and public. In above case our teams were able to conduct the rescue operation in crowded surrounding without any major injury to anybody. The above person was from public and is safe now. "

This incident serves as a clear reminder of the dangers of provoking wildlife and highlights the importance of exercising caution and respect when encountering animals in their natural habitat.
The video has garnered over 18k views, but the exact location of the incident remains unverified.
