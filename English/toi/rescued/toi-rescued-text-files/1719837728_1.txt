MANGALURU: A team of veterinarians at the Chitte Pili Rescue Centre has treated an injured python that had sustained injuries after getting entangled in a net and from air gun pellets. While nine airgun pellets remain inside the snake, and removal may not be possible, two that were right below the python’s skin have been removed, said Dr Yashaswi Naravi, a veterinarian from Chitte Pili Rescue Centre.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Dr Yashaswi told TOI, “The snake had sustained a major injury because of the net it was found entangled in, for which it was treated. However, upon examining the X-ray report, we found 11 airgun pellets, which indicates that attempts were made to kill the snake by shooting it some time back. The 12 kg female python, that is about 10 feet long, is being treated at the clinic. There is no way that the pellets can be removed. In the long run, it could lead to poisoning,” he said.
The snake is under observation by a team led by Dr Yashaswi and Dr. Meghana Pemmaiah.
The snake was rescued by Bhuvan Devadiga from Anegundi in Bejai on April 20. He said Range Forest Officer Rajesh, had informed him about the snake. “The snake was entangled in a net after it had killed a cat and was trying to swallow it. Since the rescue was difficult, the RFO sent his team with a cage, and the snake was then taken to Dr Yashaswi. This does not seem to be a recent injury of the snake. A miscreant may have tried to kill it a few months ago. This is the first of its kind rescue of a snake that I have witnessed with pellet injuries,” said Devadiga, who has rescued more than 1,000 snakes.
