NAVI MUMBAI: An over 3.5 feet long Common sand boa was rescued from near a construction site in Nerul, sector 29.
Due to hectic construction activity, close to the railway line in sector 29, the snake which was possibly disturbed had come out on the footpath, which alarmed the local shopkeepers and customers who often visit this commercial area, especially the Foodway restaurant.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
After a passerby contacted the Kharghar based wildlife activist and Sarp Mitra, Raghunath Jadhav, he sent his team member, Adarsh Wadkar, to rescue the reptile.
"A common sand boa usually lives in sandy areas or in muddy, marshy areas, away from human habitats. However, because there is a building construction taking place here in Nerul, the snake had come out on the footpath, and was therefore sighted by citizens."

Animal activist and Mumbai head of People for Animals, Vijay Rangare, said: "It is good that the citizens did not try to themselves catch the snake or harm it, as a snake expert is best suited from this job. In Goa region, the red sand boa species is also illegally poached and smuggled in an international wildlife racket."
