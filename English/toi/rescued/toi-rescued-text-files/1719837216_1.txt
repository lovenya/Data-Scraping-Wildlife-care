NEW DELHI: Eight-year-old Labrador Roger, who was trained as a drug-sniffing dog but was fired for being too friendly, has emerged as a key player in Taiwan’s rescue operations.
Roger found his true calling in search and rescue missions after his friendly demeanor led to him losing his former job. 
In the wake of Taiwan's most powerful earthquake in 25 years, search and rescue teams have been tirelessly combing through the debris in a race against time to find survivors.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNoAmidst the chaos and devastation, it's the remarkable efforts of some unlikely heroes – the search dogs – that have captured the hearts of the nation.
Deployed near Hualien's Taroko National Park, Roger demonstrated his skills by locating a victim just five minutes into the search, navigating through challenging terrain.
Mayor Chen Chi-mai of Kaohsiung, where Roger hails from, praised the Labrador's dedication in a Facebook post titled "The Paw Paw team's feat", highlighting Roger's pivotal role in uncovering vital clues that led to the rescue of survivors.
Roger's handler, Lee Hsin-hung, commended the dog's fearlessness in unfamiliar surroundings, describing him as "very agile" and noting his remarkable performance in situations not typically encountered in training exercises.
But Roger is not the only canine hero to emerge from the rubble. Three-year-old Wilson, a Jack Russell Terrier, has also made significant contributions to the rescue efforts. Despite initial doubts about his performance during training tests, Wilson proved himself by locating two victims amidst the rubble, showcasing his intelligence and determination.
While the death toll from Taiwan’s earthquake has climbed to 13, with over 1,140 injured, the efforts of dedicated teams, including these search dogs, offer a glimmer of hope amidst the devastation.
