NEW DELHI: Three individuals tragically lost their lives and two others were hospitalized in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh after inhaling suspected poisonous gas from a well they entered to rescue a cow, a police official said on Thursday.
The incident occurred in Umri village on Wednesday night. According to Nagoud police station in-charge Ashok Pandey, a group of villagers noticed that a cow had accidentally fallen into the well.
In an attempt to save the animal, three villagers descended into the well with ropes. However, they soon experienced breathlessness after entering the well.
“One of them managed to come out but fainted immediately,” Pandey said.
