Ahmedabad: Reliance Industries and Reliance Foundation announced in Jamnagar on Monday the launch of Vantara (Star of the Forest) programme, an umbrella initiative to focus on rescue, treatment, care and rehabilitation of injured, abused and threatened animals, both in India and abroad. Spread over 3,000 acres within the Green Belt of Reliance’s Jamnagar Refinery Complex, Vantara aims to be one of the leading contributors to conservation efforts globally.
By working with leading experts in animal care and welfare, Vantara has converted the space into a jungle-like environment that mimics the natural, enriching, lush and verdant habitat for the rescued species to thrive in.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The initiative, the first of its kind in India, has been conceptualized and birthed under the leadership of Anant Ambani, director on the boards of RIL and Reliance Foundation. Ambani is also spearheading Reliance’s ambitious renewable energy business in Jamnagar, and, in that capacity, is responsible for leading Reliance’s journey to become a net carbon zero company by 2035.
Vantara is aimed at animal conservation and care practices including state-of-the-art healthcare, hospitals, research and academic centres. The focus is on integrating advanced research and collaboration with reputed international universities and organizations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF).
