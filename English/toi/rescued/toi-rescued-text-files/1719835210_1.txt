BHUBANESWAR: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Tuesday rescued 351 Indian tent turtles in Cuttack, thwarting an attempt to smuggle them from West Bengal to Karnataka. Three persons were detained in connection with the incident.
Acting on a tip-off, DRI officials were on a watch out near the Munguli toll plaza in Cuttack on Saturday. They spotted a vehicle coming from West Bengal with three passengers.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Subsequent interrogation revealed the trio were transporting the turtles from West Bengal to Karnataka. Sources said the three of them have been detained under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Officials said the Indian tent turtle is listed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act and is thereby provided the highest degree of protection.
"In an example of close inter-agency coordination, the turtles were immediately handed over to the state forest officials. The three persons, along with their vehicle, were detained," read a DRI statement.
