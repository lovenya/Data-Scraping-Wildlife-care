Kannur: Two fishermen who were stuck in the sea after their fishing boat suffered an engine failure on Thursday night were rescued by coastal police from Thalassery here on Friday morning. 
The boat ‘Imbichi Bava’ had set off from Kasaragod and it was moving to Tanur in Malappuram. The boat had an engine failure in Arabian sea around 10 nautical miles away from Mahe coast.
The fishermen, Noufal and Jalal, were rescued and brought back to the shore around 1am, after hours-long joint effort by the coastal police, Coast Guard and fishermen. 
Initially, Coast Guard had tried to airlift the trapped fishermen. But the efforts turned futile owing to bad weather condition.
Later, the Coastal police continued the rescue operation by using another fishing boat and saved the duo.
