PHASIDEWA: 'Qurbani' has assumed a new meaning for residents of Chhota Nirmal Jote village.
The hamlet of 88 families, majority of them Muslims, had deferred Eid-ul-Zuha celebrations on Monday and joined hands to rescue passengers of the ill-fated Kanchanjungha Express. 
The villagers finally offered 'qurbani' on Tuesday, a day after Bakrid, but held a muted celebration. 
The villagers rushed to the rescue of passengers moments after finishing their namaz, and were busy throughout the day dragging the injured out of the mangled coaches and transporting them to hospital. Leading the group was a team of 12 friends, all in their early twenties.

"Some of us received cuts and bruises while breaking open the windows and pulling out the injured as we did not have proper tools. We managed with whatever we could take from the village," said Md Hassan, a local.
Their efforts were acknowledged by Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee when she visited the hospital on Monday. 
"We pulled out at least 10 people and transported over 40 passengers from the train to the ambulance and other vehicles, on which they were taken to the hospital," said Md Shamim Akthar, another local.
