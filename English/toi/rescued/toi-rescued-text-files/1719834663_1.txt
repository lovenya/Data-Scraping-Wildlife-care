During preliminary investigation, police found that Ansari was operating the racket by sending youngsters to Cambodia by using his contacts with Shadaab, who has links with Chinese nationals in Cambodia.
Shiva, who was sent by Prasad three months ago, was told that his nature of work would be "software operations". He, however, was forced to slog in the Chinese firm for 16 hours a day and commit cyber fraud.
Police said Shiva's work was to call up people in India, lure them with job offers and cheat them. Prasad worked as a chef in a Maldives restaurant where he got in touch with Sadakat. 
Police stumbled upon the racket after Shiva's mother, A Lakshmi, met the district SP and told him about her son's ordeal.
