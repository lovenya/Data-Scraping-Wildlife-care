NEW DELHI: Israeli military announced on Saturday that it had successfully rescued four hostages who were abducted by Hamas during an attack on October 7. The complex daytime operation took place in Nuseirat, where the hostages were found in two separate locations. The rescued individuals were identified as Noa Argamani (25), Almog Meir Jan (21), Andrey Kozlov (27), and Shlomi Ziv (40), and were reported to be in good health.
The rescue mission carried out on Saturday resulted in the successful recovery of the highest number of hostages since the beginning of the conflict. This operation brings the total count of freed captives to seven.
During the October 7 attack on southern Israel, Hamas captured around 250 hostages, the Israel military said. Around half of them were freed during a week-long cease-fire in November. However, Israel estimates that more than 130 hostages are still being held captive, with about 25% of them presumed dead.
