NEW DELHI: India launched 'Operation Indravati' to evacuate its nationals from Haiti-where streets have been taken over by criminal gangs- to Dominican Republic.
"Twelve Indians evacuated today. Fully committed to the security and well-being of our nationals abroad. Thank the Government of the Dominican Republic for their support," said foreign minister S Jaishankar in a post on X.
Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Haiti and thousands killed amid widespread reports of rape, arson and ransom kidnappings, while food prices soar and hospitals run short of key supplies such as blood and oxygen, reported Reuters.
With no embassy in Haiti, India is monitoring the situation by its mission at Santo Domingo, capital of Dominican Republic. There are 75 to 90 Indians in Haiti and 60 have registered to return "if need be", external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
