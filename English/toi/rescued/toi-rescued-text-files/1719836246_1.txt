Sungarhi SHO Pawan Pandey said the body was sent for autopsy, while the crocodile was rescued and released in the deep waters of the river. The crocodile had chewed a part of his head and had attacked many domestic cattle within a week, he added. 
However, divisional forest officer Manish Singh denied the possibility of a crocodile attack. He said, "The body had turned stiff indicating the death occurred long back. His body parts were also found intact. If this was a crocodile attack, it would've swallowed the body."
