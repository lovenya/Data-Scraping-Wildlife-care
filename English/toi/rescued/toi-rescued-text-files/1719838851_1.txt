JAIPUR: "All the employees were trapped since Tuesday night. We attempted various methods to rescue them. First we thought of using ladders, but since most of them had injuries we pulled them up using pulleys and ropes. From 1,640ft, we lifted them up to 1,180ft. From this level, we could take them out of the mine to waiting ambulances. All of them had minor to major injuries, and we had to be careful," said Subrata Guha, deputy general manager (electrical), who was part of the Khetri Copper Complex rescue team.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
