After the fall, Shinde had called his mother from the mobile phone he was carrying with him to inform her about the mishap, but could not gie details of his location as the call dropped due to a poor network. His mother assumed that he must have fallen at their business location and asked him to come home. 
Shinde was rescued after he called his friend, Hrushikesh Koli, son of one of the leading rescue team members Sunil Koli.

Rescuers fear he may have sustained internal injuries while skidding.
Sunil Koli said, "He stuck to a tree and plain rock surface. We did not lose any time in rescuing him. His chance of survival could have been little had he fallen on his left side (Madhavji point) having a waterfall. He is twice lucky to have his mobile phone with him." Koli added, "We had offered him water, and the rescue operation was conducted as per the guidance of doctor Dr Sachin Wani."
