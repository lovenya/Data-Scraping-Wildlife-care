Lalbiakthangi's mother, Remi, heard her daughter's calls for help and immediately arrived at the scene. Together, they managed to get the boy out through the window. Lalbiakthangi then managed to crawl out of the window without sustaining major burn injuries. However, she lost her pair of shoes in the fire.
