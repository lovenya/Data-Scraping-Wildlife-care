HYDERABAD: Hyderabad police on Wednesday rescued three more infants sold to childless couples by agents of an inter-state child trafficking racket that was busted Tuesday. So far, 14 children have been rescued from different parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Police suspect the gang had 'buyers' outside the two Telugu speaking states as well.
"At this moment, we only have information about the trafficked children being sold in the two states.But since one of the accused, Mudavath Sharada, arrested from Vijayawada, is also involved in a similar case registered in Mumbai, we are verifying if children were also sold in Maharashtra or any other state," a senior police officer told TOI. "After news of the racket broke, Mumbai police have also contacted us seeking details of the case," he added.
So far, 11 persons have been arrested and booked on charges of trafficking of infants through 'suppliers' in Delhi and Pune. Police have now initiated the process of naming the couples who purchased the kids from the agents, as accused.
The infants were sold for anywhere up to Rs 6 lakh.
"We rescued these kids from 13 couples and a single mother. They, too, shall now face legal action. We are yet to finalise the sections (of IPC and/or JJ Act) under which they will be booked," the officer said, adding that the hunt for the 'suppliers' was on.
Though police suspect that the 'suppliers' bought most of these children from poor parents, they have not ruled out the possibility of kidnapping. "This can be ascertained once we nab them. Tracking down the biological parents of these infants will also be possible after that," the officer added.
