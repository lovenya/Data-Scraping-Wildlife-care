The fire department said they sent six fire tenders with 40 firefighters after receiving a call at 10.14am on Friday. Officials said the fire originated from a second-floor flat in the four-storey building. 
The team was led by station officer Mukul Bharadwaj. “Each floor had three flats. The fire completely charred the second floor. Panicked residents on the first and second floors managed to escape, but others remained trapped as smoke filled the building’s only staircase," the officer said.
Firefighters used ladders to rescue two adults and three children trapped on the third and fourth floors. Police are probing the cause of the fire.
