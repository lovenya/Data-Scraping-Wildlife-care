A police officer investigating the matter said, "Vishnu Pandey (18), Ankit Dixit (19), Yash Gupta (18), and Golu Gupta (19) went for a dip under the bridge across Chhoti Ganga canal near Raihar village.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWithout realising, they moved into deep water and started drowning." 
He added, "Hearing their screams, some villagers jumped into the canal and pulled out Golu Gupta."
Mainpuri deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sunil Kumar told TOI, "The incident took place around 10am under Kishni police limits. A team of divers and the police are conducting a search operation. The lone survivor is doing well. They were all from the same locality in Kusmara and were studying at various colleges. Their families have been informed."
Manoj Singh, a local at the site, said, "When a few villagers saw them going to the canal, they cautioned them of the water depth and risk of drowning, but they didn't heed the advice. Soon after, this tragic incident took place."
