KALYAN: A cat that had fallen into a 30-foot-deep drain in Kalyan (east), and had been stranded there was rescued on Sunday after six days of being there. 
The cat, fondly called Ladoo, had fallen into the drain in the Lokgram locality, while it was being chased by stray dogs from the neighbourhood.
Nilesh Bhange, founder of PAWS, an animal welfare NGO, said that on Sunday he received a phone call from a local feeder, Gaurav Samarth, who informed him that a cat had been stranded and was in misery.

Since it had fallen there, the feeder had been trying to feed it by lowering a basket with food, a rope tied to it, but the "traumatised and distressed" feline was not eating anything.
