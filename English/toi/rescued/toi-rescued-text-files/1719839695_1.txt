MYSURU: Police sub-inspector Bharathi and her team were on patrol duty on May 26 near Cheluvanahalli on the outskirts of Kolar on Bengaluru-Chennai highway when they were startled at the sight of an apparition some distance ahead of them. The trudging apparition disabused them of their fears and they approached it, only to find a man fully covered in ash and mud, bleeding and stumbling.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Bharathi informed her higher-ups and took steps to shift the injured man to a hospital in the nick of time. Nagesh, 32, a resident of Mallasandra, had sustained grievous injuries after he was attacked by his wife’s kin. Nagesh is now recovering.
Sources said Nagesh fell in love with Ashwini of neighbouring Vanarashi village and married her eight years ago. They had a girl child. Differences cropped up between them in the recent past and Ashwini lodged a harassment complaint against him at Kolar Rural police station.
According to police, Ashwini’s maternal uncle Narayanaswamy asked Nagesh to divorce her. On May 26, Nagesh went to Ashwini’s house for dinner. After that, her brother Ramesh and Narayanaswamy offered to drop him home but took him to Maderahalli forest. They allegedly attacked him with a knife. Nagesh fell into a pit and his body was covered with ash and dust.
As he was unconscious, Ramesh and his maternal uncle thought he was dead and left. After a couple of hours, Nagesh crawled out of the pit and walked up to the NH. K Kantharaju, circle inspector, Kolar Rural police, said search is on for the accused.
