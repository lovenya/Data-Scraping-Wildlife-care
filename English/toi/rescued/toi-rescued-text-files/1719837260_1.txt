BHOPAL: A 6-year-old boy fell into an open borewell in MP's Rewa district on Friday evening. Rescuers are working frantically to reach him as a lot of soil also got into the borewell after he fell.
Mayank Kol is trapped at a depth of around 50 feet, rescuers believe. A parallel tunnel has been dug to a depth of around 30 feet by around 10pm. Oxygen is being pumped into the borewell.
"A camera was lowered to a depth of around 40 feet into the borewell but the child couldn't be seen. He may have been covered in the soil that fell after him. He is at a depth between 50 feet and 60 feet," Rewa collector Pratibha Pal told TOI.

He had gone to the fields with some friends on Friday afternoon. They were playing when he fell into the open borewell around 5pm.
His friends raised the alarm and villagers rushed to help but there was no way they could see Mayank. Police were informed and rescue operations started immediately. The Rewa collector and SP also rushed to the spot.
Five JCB machines and other equipment are being used to dig a parallel tunnel and rescue Mayank. Thankfully, the diggers haven’t hit any stones so far but evening rain hindered the rescue effort for some time and heightened concern. MP has failed to plug the danger of open borewells from one end of the state to another. Last year, four kids, aged 2.5 years to 5 years, died in such tragedies in Alirajpur, Rajgarh, Vidisha and Sehore districts. Two of those incidents happened in Dec, prompting the govt to promise to close all open borewells.
