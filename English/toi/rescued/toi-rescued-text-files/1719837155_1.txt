New mommy Anushka Sharma is an avid animal lover and often voices her support for stricter laws against animal cruelty. On Thursday, the 'Zero' actress took to her Instagram stories to reshare a CCTV video that captured a boy being attacked by a pit bull in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.
The clip shows the boy being knocked down by the charging pit bull, with a man and a woman watching from a distance without intervening.The boy kicks and rolls on the ground, attempting to free himself from the dog's grip. To divert the dog's attention, someone throws water, allowing the boy to stand up and run to safety, with the dog still pursuing him. Upon reaching a door, the boy holds onto it, trying to enter the house, when street dogs rush in and confront the pit bull, helping the boy in getting inside.
Anushka captioned the video as, "To highlight both sides."

Anushka Sharma, currently in London with her newborn son Akaay and daughter Vamika, is expected to return to India to support husband Virat Kohli during the later stages of the ongoing IPL season. The couple kept mum about Anushka's second pregnancy and only made it official after Akaay was born on February 15, 2024.
