CHENNAI: In a dramatic turn of events, Tamil Nadu fire and rescue services personnel were called to Vanavil Nagar in Kancheepuram on Tuesday to rescue members of a family trapped on the first floor of their home after their landlord demolished the staircase. The incident occurred after a prolonged dispute between the landlord and his tenants over payment of rent. 
Venugopal, who had rented the first floor of the house last year, fell ill and became partially disabled, which severely impacted his ability to work and earn an income. As a result, he was unable to pay rent for six months. Despite being given an additional month to settle the arrears, Venugopal and his family could not make the payment, prompting their landlord, Srinivasan, to take drastic measures. 
Srinivasan, who runs an offset printing unit in Kancheepuram, had already cut off the electricity, drinking water pipelines, and sewage lines to the property the previous week. On Tuesday evening, he hired an earthmover and 10 workers to demolish the staircase, effectively trapping the family on the first floor. 
The family, unable to escape, called the police helpline (100), which in turn alerted Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS). The rescue team arrived at the scene within 20 minutes. Using a fire ladder from a neighboring terrace, they managed to rescue Venugopal’s wife Leela, and their son. However, due to Venugopal’s inability to walk, the team had to tie him to a rope and carefully lower him to safety
