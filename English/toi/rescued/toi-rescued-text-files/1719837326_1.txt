BHOPAL: A six-year-old child who had fallen into a borewell in Madhya Pradesh's Rewa district on Friday evening is dead. Rescuers finally reached Mayank Kol on Sunday afternoon, after a gruelling 45-hour operation, but found him covered in soil and rocks.
Tired hands and anguished hearts roped the child's body 40 feet up to the surface. Mayank was taken to hospital where doctors confirmed the worst.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoMayank had gone to the farm in Manika village, close to MP-UP border, along with other kids to collect leftovers of harvested wheat crop. It was while picking up handfuls of grains that he fell into the flimsily covered borewell.
He was stuck 36 ft to 40 ft down the 70-ft borewell. Rescuers worked relentlessly, without a break, for nearly two days and two nights, but were hampered by unseasonal rain and loose earth. The borewell walls were not cemented, so soil kept falling into it.
"Had it not been for the rocks and soil that fell on the child after he slipped into the borewell, I believe we would have been able to save him," SDM Teonthar Sanjay Kumar Jain told TOI.
