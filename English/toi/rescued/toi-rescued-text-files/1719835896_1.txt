NEW DELHI: Indian Navy has come to the rescue of yet another commercial vessel, the Panama-flagged crude oil tanker Andromeda Star, after it sustained minor damage in a missile attack by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.
Destroyer INS Kochi, responding to the "maritime security incident", rushed to the aid of Andromeda Star, which had a 30-member crew, including 22 Indian nationals, an officer said on Sunday.
"First, an aerial reconnaissance by a helicopter was undertaken to assess the situation. Then, an explosive ordnance disposal team boarded the merchant vessel for residual risk assessment. The crew members were found to be safe," he added. The oil tanker is now continuing its transit to Vadinar in India.
"The Navy's swift action reiterates the commitment and resolve of the force in safeguarding the seafarers plying through the region," the officer said.
