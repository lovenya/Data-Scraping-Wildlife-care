NEW DELHI: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that "Israel does not surrender to terrorism" following the successful rescue of four hostages by Israeli troops on Saturday. 
The hostages, identified as Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were held captive by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip after being abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7.
The rescued individuals were taken to a hospital and reported to be in "good medical condition." 
In a statement from the situation room, Netanyahu emphasized the commitment to bringing all hostages home, both living and deceased.
