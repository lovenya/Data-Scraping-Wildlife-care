Colva:Drishti Marine lifesavers rescued three turtles at Colva beach on Sunday and handed them over to the forest department’s marine unit. 
Range forest officer (marine) Rajesh Naik told TOI that two turtles were Red Eared Sliders and the third one was an Indian Flapshell turtle.
The Red Eared Sliders, Naik said, are a non-native exotic species of turtle that have increased in India due to unregulated pet trade. 
“They are harmful to the local habitats and should not be released or abandoned as the beach is not their habitat,” he said. 
The Indian Flapshell Turtle, Naik said, is a semi aquatic terrestrial turtle that is native to Goa. This breed lives near ponds and streams.
Naik said non-native Red Eared Sliders will be kept in captivity while the native species will be released into the appropriate habitat.
