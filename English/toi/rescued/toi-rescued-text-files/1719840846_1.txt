NAVI MUMBAI: The New Panvel based NGO, SEAL, along with the local police of various jurisdictions, have successfully rescued a total of 140 desperate homeless persons from the streets in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan and other adjoining areas in their mission tagged as #BeforeTheRains.
Talking to TOI, the founder of Social and Evangelical Association for Love (SEAL), Pastor K M Philip, said, "This is the first time that we have managed to rescue so many homeless people in one go with the help of police.Our four ambulances have been daily going to various parts to check those who may be in a hopeless situation, and therefore need help. Our target was to rescue at least 100, so we are happy to have helped 140."
Philip added, "In some areas like Ulhasnagar, Kalyan, it was sad to see ailing homeless people simply lying on the roadsides and footpaths, waiting to die. Some persons were also addicted to harmful substances. Hence, we again appeal to the goverment to help social workers and citizens to do this God's work. An effective Helpline to rescue such homeless persons will also be good."
The #BeforeTheRains mission had been launched last month at SEAL Ashram in New Panvel, near Nere, in the presence of senior cops of Panvel division, Navi Mumbai Police.
