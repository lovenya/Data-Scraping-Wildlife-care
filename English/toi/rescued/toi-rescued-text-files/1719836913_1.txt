VIJAYAPURA: A two-year-old boy who had fallen into a borewell in a Karnataka village was rescued after a gruelling 20-hour operation on Thursday afternoon, making it an emotional moment for his parents, villagers and even rescuers.
Satvik Satish Mujagond Satvik had fallen into an open, defunct borewell while playing on his grandfather's farmland in Lachyana village in Indi taluk of Vijayapura district on Wednesday evening.He was trapped at a depth of 20 feet, said rescuers involved in the operation.
Personnel from NDRF, SDRF, revenue, health and other departments joined hands and pulled out the toddler at 1.42 pm, alive and breathing.
The rescue team dug a parallel well to create a passage to reach Satvik. However, as the boy was stuck upside down inside the borewell, the challenge was to bring him out safely without injuring him. The presence of a hard rock in the area posed a major challenge, causing some delays. But, the rescue managed to cut through the hard rock using hand drilling machines.
The health team ensured a steady supply of oxygen to Satvik. Oxygen pipes were lowered into the borewell, providing him with a continuous supply for 20 hours, which kept him alive.
 Throughout the ordeal, his parents were inconsolable, and their anxiety palpable. After he was brought out safely, Pooja Mujagond, Satvik's mother, was overwhelmed. "My child is alive because of God's grace, the efforts of officials and prayers of the villagers. We will go to Sri Siddalinga Maharaj temple to fulfil the vow we had taken for his safe rescue," she said.
Satvik was given first aid at taluk hospital and later shifted to the district hospital. "All his vital parameters are normal. As the boy was stuck upside down, there are chances of brain edema, so a CT scan has been suggested. He was dehydrated but will recover," said Dr Basavaraj Hubballi, district health officer.
