BENGALURU: When P Gowri Shankar, herpetologist from Agumbe in Thirthahalli taluk, Shivamogga district, received a phone call from an agriculturist in Nadapal village, Hebri in Udupi district recently, he never thought he would be catching a 15ft king cobra for first time in his nearly two decade of professional life.
Travelling around 30 kilometres in his multi-utility vehicle, Shankar and his associate reached the village and walked into the agricultural land, only to spot the king cobra hiding amidst green grass in a large pit.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“This is the largest king cobra I have seen so far!” he said.
Using a ‘snake hook’, Shankar caught the cobra, and got it to slither into the bag. After tying the bag with a rope, Shankar weighed the snake with spring scale. The snake weighed 12.5kg and was found to be 15 feet long.
Meanwhile, the owner of agricultural land, his family members, anxious neighbours and Shankar's associate were busy recording the rare event on their phones. “I have caught about 400 king cobras in the last 18 years in different parts of the world. The largest king cobra I’ve caught was about 14 feet long and weighed about 10kg. But this is the largest in terms of length and weight I’ve caught so far. King cobras in Thailand measure up to 18 feet,” he said. Shankar later released the snake into a thick forest nearby.
One of the wettest places in India, Agumbe, is home to a maximum number of king cobras. Shankar has established Kalinga Centre for Rainforest Ecology in its dense forest to do research on king cobras.
