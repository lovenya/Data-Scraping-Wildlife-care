ISTANBUL: A FedEx Airlines Boeing cargo plane landed at Istanbul Airport on Wednesday without its front landing gear deployed and managed to stay on the runway, Turkey's transport ministry said, adding that there were no casualties.
The Boeing 767 aircraft, flying from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, informed the traffic control tower at Istanbul Airport that its landing gear failed to open and it landed with guidance from the tower, the ministry said in its statement.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
Airport rescue and fire fighting teams made necessary preparations on the runway before landing, and no one was injured, the ministry also said, without giving a reason for the failure.
Video footage obtained from Reuters showed sparks flying and smoke billowing as the front end of the plane scraped along the runway before being doused with firefighting foam.
