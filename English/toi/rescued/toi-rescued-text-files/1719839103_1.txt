QUITO: Five rescue dogs were honored by Ecuador's fire department on Monday at a ceremony formally retiring them after seven years of service and turning them over to new adoptive owners.
Lieutenant colonel Esteban Cardenas said the dogs - Ares, Kratos, Zeus, Titan and Gaia - were part of the first class of canines used by the department's rescue unit, which works with German shepherds and golden retrievers.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
 Cardenas recalled some of their feats, including aiding in finding survivors of earthquakes and landslides across Ecuador and abroad, including a mission to Mexico in 2017.
 He said veterinarian reports had suggested it was time to retire the five dogs.

 The dogs' new owners were selected carefully after meeting certain requirements, he said.
 Gaia's new owner, Valeria Zevallos, said she was amazed by her new pet's previous career of saving lives.
 "Many adventures await us now. After her work adventures, family adventures," she said.
