When the team reached the house and knocked on the door, it was locked from inside. The husband broke open the backdoor entry and entered the house where he saw his wife trying to hang herself using a ‘dupatta’. 
While the husband rescued his wife, the woman kept insisting that he should not go anywhere. “We explained to her that she was the mother of a six-month-old kid and taking such an extreme step would ruin the entire family,” the counsellor said.
“After thorough counselling, she apologized to her mother-in-law and husband assuring them that she would not repeat such a step,” the counsellor said.
