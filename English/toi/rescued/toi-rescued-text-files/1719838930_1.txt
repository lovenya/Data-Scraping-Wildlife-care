The father of an Israeli hostage held in war-torn Gaza for eight months died just one day before his son was rescued in a special forces raid, relatives said Sunday. Ever since the Oct 7 attack, Yossi Jan had desperately waited for news on his son Almog Meir Jan, 22, who was among those abducted from the Nova music festival. "My brother died of grief and didn't see his son return," Yossi Jan's sister said.His funeral was held on Sunday, attended by Almog.
