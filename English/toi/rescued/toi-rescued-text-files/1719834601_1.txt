Hyderabad: In a tragic accident, a 21-year-old man drowned in the Jampanna Vagu at Medaram Jathara on Saturday. According to police, the victim was identified as Rohith Lal from Malakpet. His body was recovered from the stream on Sunday.
Alleging that the police did not start the rescue operation when they sought help, Rohith’s cousin Pavan said that on knowing that Rohith had drowned near Deyyala Madugu behind Chilukalaghutta near the Jathara site, they rushed to Medaram from Hyderabad.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo“When we reported the matter to the local police, the head constables did not respond and cops said that they would check but it didn’t happen,” said Pavan adding that cops only came to the spot when the relatives spotted the body later. 
“But it had already become dark and they could do nothing. If they had said that they can’t do anything, we would have made some arrangements ,” said Pavan.
On Sunday, an officer called Pavan and inquired about the issue and assured that he would bring out Rohith’s body.
