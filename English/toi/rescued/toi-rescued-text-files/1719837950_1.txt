CHENNAI: A seven-month-old girl child slipped out of her mother's hands from a fourth floor balcony, landed on a metal roof over a portion of the first floor of an apartment in Avadi, and looked in danger of slipping and falling to the ground, but was rescued in the nick of time on Sunday.
 As scores of residents of the apartment complex watched helplessly, a couple of men climbed on to the ledge below the roof and one of them managed to pull the baby to safety.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoSome others were waiting on the ground holding a sheet to catch the baby if she fell.
