ISLAMABAD: Two Indian fishermen were missing while one Pakistani sailor was killed on Thursday in an incident at sea, according to Pakistan maritime authorities.
The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) said one of its ships was patrolling Pakistan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) when it encountered around eight Indian fishing vessels engaged in "illegal fishing activities".PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
To evade capture, it said, one of the fishing boats increased its speed and started to move towards Indian waters. The boat slowed down after multiple verbal warnings, allowing the PMSA ship's team to embark. "Once PMSA personnel were on board, it suddenly accelerated and collided with the PMSA ship. Consequently, the fishing vessel capsized and sank." The PMSA ship acted swiftly to rescue five out of the seven Indian fishermen and four PMSA personnel. However, one PMSA sailor was killed while two remaining Indian fishermen are still missing. 
A rescue operation is on.
