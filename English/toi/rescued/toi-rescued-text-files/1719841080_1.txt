HYDERABAD: The ever-busy Begumpet railway station, manned by a dedicated team of 25 women constables and ticket checking staff, has become a beacon of safety and efficiency in Telangana's railway network. 
Over the past three months, their vigilance has averted three potentially fatal accidents, rescuing passengers in perilous situations who were slipping from the trains.
In a recent incident aboard the Mumbai LTT Express, two passengers nearly fell beneath the train's wheels while disembarking the train at the station, where it was not scheduled to halt. "The women police were quick to react. They provided immediate medical aid and arranged for an ambulance, ensuring the injured were swiftly taken to a nearby hospital," said a woman police officer at Begumpet railway station.
This station, which sees a daily footfall of over 16,000 commuters, is the only major railway station in Telangana to be entirely managed by women staff, including police officers, ticket collectors, and booking clerks.

As she attempted to board the moving train, she lost her balance, risking a fall beneath its wheels. Fortunately, alert ticket collectors, who witnessed the incident swiftly jumped into action.
"The student was with a friend who managed to board successfully. However, as the train picked up speed, she struggled and lost her footing, nearly falling. We rushed to her aid and pulled her to safety," Aarthi, chief ticket inspector said.
Apart from rescuing passengers in distress, these women staff members efficiently manage boarding operations during tight stoppage times, return lost items, assist pregnant women, and even handle drug seizures, going above and beyond their duties.
Recently, a woman who had left her laptop on a train rushed back in distress to retrieve it. A vigilant female staff member noticed and promptly alerted the onboard RPF personnel. Within an hour, they located and returned her belongings.
Night shifts pose particular challenges for the station's women staff, especially between 10 pm and 6 am. They face individuals under the influence of alcohol and drugs without valid tickets causing disturbances.
"We handle about 20 trains during night hours, and dealing with ticketless passengers can be challenging. There have been instances where we've had to chase and apprehend them," explained Pallavi Mallick, station incharge.
