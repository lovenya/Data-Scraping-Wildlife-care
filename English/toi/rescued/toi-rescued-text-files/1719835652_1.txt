YANGON: One person died and around 20 were missing after a deluge of water and mud swept through a jade mine in northern Myanmar, a rescue worker and local media said on Tuesday.
An old mining pit used to store rain runoff in Hpakant township in Kachin state burst its banks at around 4:30 am on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), a rescuer told AFP.
Mud and water flooded another pit around 100 feet (30 metres) below, burying around 20 people working there along with several vehicles, they said. PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo

Dozens die each year while working in Myanmar's highly lucrative but poorly regulated jade industry, which feeds insatiable demand for the gem in neighbouring China.
Miners also come to Hpakant from across Myanmar to pick through the piles of waste in the hopes of finding an overlooked hunk of jade.
In 2020, heavy rainfall triggered a massive landslide at another mine in Hpakant that entombed nearly 300 miners.
Watchdog Global Witness estimated that the industry was worth about $31 billion in 2014.
