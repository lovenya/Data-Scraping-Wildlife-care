Panaji: Lifeguards at Polem Beach rescued two turtles on Thursday. One turtle, identified as a Green Sea Turtle and another larger Olive Ridley Sea Turtle, were found alive and exhausted, likely due to heavy winds and high waves. 
These turtles are now set to receive treatment under the supervision of the forest department.
“Every year, Goa’s coast like other coastal states receives cases of stranded marine species.Many of these, such as sea turtles, cetaceans (whales, porpoises and dolphins) are protected under Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act of India. Thus, handling them is not allowed without training and authorisation from the Goa forest department which is the custodian of all wildlife in the state,” said Puja Mitra, marine conservationist, Terra Conscious.
