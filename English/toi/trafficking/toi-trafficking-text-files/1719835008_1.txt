PITHORAGARH: A special sessions court in Pithoragarh has sentenced a Nepalese woman, Anushka Budathoki (25) to 20 years of imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 1.5 lakh on her. In case she fails to pay the fine, she will have to serve additional 5 years of imprisonment, the court said. 
Anushka Budathoki, who had been absconding, was apprehended and presented before the court on Thursday.
Hailing from Dumling village of Darchula in Nepal, Anushka was arrested in April 2021 for attempting to transport 1.4 kg of charas from Nepal across the Dharchula bridge. She was taken into custody under the NDPS Act. However, on August 6, she managed to escape from the lockup.
On August 8, the court found Anushka guilty under the NDPS Act and issued a non-bailable warrant for her arrest. Police thereafter on the same day successfully tracked her down in Thal town, where she had sought refuge. Subsequently, she was produced before the court on Thursday, where the judgment was pronounced.
