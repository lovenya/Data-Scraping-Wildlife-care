NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday busted a major human trafficking network involved in sending Indian youths to Russia-Ukraine war zone on the pretext of lucrative jobs.
According to officials, the CBI is conducting searches across Delhi, Trivandrum, Mumbai, Ambala, Chandigarh, Madurai and Chennai. The officials said the agency has registered an FIR against various visa consultancy firms and agents.
The development comes a day after a 30-year-old man from Hyderabad, Mohammed Afsan, who had been allegedly duped into joining the Russian army, has been killed in the ongoing war with Ukraine.
He is the second Indian to be killed in the conflict after a man from Gujarat, Hamil Mangukiya from Surat, was killed about a week ago. Mohammed Imran, Afsanâ€™s brother, wrote back to the Moscow embassy on X, asking for proof of the death. Imran had told TOI recently that he was planning to go to Moscow to trace his brother and bring him home. Imran later told TOI that although he had received a call from the Moscow embassy confirming the death, the recruiting agent claimed his brother was alive and would get some proof latest by Tuesday.
Like Afsan, a number of youth from Telangana and other places in India were assured of jobs in Russia with hefty salaries and no danger to their lives. The agent also allegedly collected Rs 3.5 lakh each from those who he facilitated to travel to Russia. However, at no point did he indicate that they were being recruited for the Russian army.
Last month, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) had issued a warning to Indian citizens regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine after reports emerged of Indian nationals being recruited for support roles in the Russian army. The MEA has also taken up the matter with Russian authorities to ensure the early discharge of these individuals.
MEA had also said that around 20 Indians were still stranded in Russia and the government was making efforts to bring them back.
