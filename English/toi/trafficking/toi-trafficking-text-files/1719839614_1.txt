NEW DELHI: Following the busting of a major human trafficking network by CBI, govt on Friday appealed to Indian nationals not to be swayed by offers made by agents for support jobs with the Russian Army and said it was committed to ensuring early release of its citizens. Such job offers were fraught with danger and risk to life, a foreign ministry statement said.
Govt had earlier admitted that several Indian nationals were duped into working with the Russian Army and that some of them were discharged after it raised the issue with Russian authorities. About 20 Indian nationals are said to have sought help from the Indian embassy in Moscow for their discharge.
“We have taken up the matter with Russia for early discharge of such Indian nationals. Strong action has been initiated against agents and unscrupulous elements who recruited them on false pretexts and promises,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
CBI on Thursday busted a major trafficking network and conducted searches in several cities. A case of human trafficking has been registered against several agents.
Jaiswal’s comments at his weekly media briefing came days after Mohammed Asfan from Hyderabad, who was duped into joining Russia’s war against Ukraine, was killed. The Indian embassy in Moscow on Wednesday confirmed Asfan’s death
