Among the passengers staying behind were two people questioned by French police over suspected people trafficking, but a judicial source said police released them "after establishing that the 303 passengers had boarded the plane of their own free will".

The suspects' release came because "the investigating judge was able to resist media pressure in this case", said their lawyer, Salome Cohen.
According to media reports, two passengers were detained following interrogation by the French authorities. 
Meanwhile, the prefectâ€™s office initiated a judicial investigation with a focus on the purpose and conditions under which these passengers were being flown to the central American country.
