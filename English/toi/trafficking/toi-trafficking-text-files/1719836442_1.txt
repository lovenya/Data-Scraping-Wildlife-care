Ohio's attorney general announced on Monday that a statewide crackdown on patrons of sex workers resulted in 160 arrests, predominantly men suspected of being "johns", reported NBC News.
Dubbed "Operation Buyer's Remorse," this weeklong operation spanned across every corner of Ohio and apprehended individuals ranging from a 17-year-old suspected of soliciting a sex worker to an 84-year-old suspected of the same offense, according to the attorney general's office.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
Out of the 149 arrests directly related to solicitation, the remaining 11 individuals faced charges related to "promoting prostitution" as defined by state law, a practice that perpetuates the demand for human trafficking, as emphasized by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost in a video produced by his office.
The operation extended its reach to Toledo, where the U.S. Border Patrol, one of the 100 participating law enforcement agencies, executed warrant-based searches of five massage parlors characterized as "illicit" by the attorney general's office. This led to the arrest of six individuals suspected of compelling prostitution at these locations.

Attorney General Yost portrayed this operation as a significant victory in the broader battle against human trafficking, a complex criminal activity often intertwined with the sex trade.
James Schultz, the police chief in Willoughby, Ohio, discussed the realities of human trafficking in the attorney general's video, emphasizing that many individuals involved in sex work are, in fact, victims who are coerced or forced into their circumstances.
Behind these arrests were eight task forces deployed across the state. They orchestrated undercover stings in late September, drawing suspected offenders into fake encounters with sex workers, as detailed in the statement and video.
During the operation, more than 100 survivors of human trafficking were identified and contacted, referred to in the video as "potential victims." They were offered information about available social services.
It's important to note that none of the suspects arrested were explicitly accused of human trafficking. Ohio does have laws against human trafficking, but these laws were not invoked in the arrests mentioned by the attorney general's office.
The video featured an unnamed detainee who asserted, "I'm not a bad person. I just enjoy sex. I'm not going to lie."
Notably, organizations representing sex workers and civil liberties, along with some academics, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. These groups have consistently opposed the criminalization of sex work, even in cases where sex workers themselves were not the primary targets.
In 2020, the Yale Global Health Justice Partnership released a document on sex work policy, stating, "There is no evidence that criminalizing sex work deters those who may sell or buy sex." The document highlighted the negative consequences of criminalization, including increased risks for sex workers and reduced access to safety measures and health services.
