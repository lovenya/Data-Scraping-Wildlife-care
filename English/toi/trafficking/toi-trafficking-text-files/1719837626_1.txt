The recovery rate for children in 2022 stood at 87%, with 3,588 children successfully traced.
According to Telangana police, when a missing child complaint is filed, it will be documented under Section 154 of the CrPC with an assumption of either abduction or trafficking.
The state has a dedicated missing persons monitoring cell employing advanced technology to address such cases, ensuring the reunification of the missing children with their families.
Explaining the procedure, a senior police officer said, "Upon registering a missing person complaint, a lookout circular will be issued to all police stations in the state. We will gather all the details of the missing children, including photographs and measurements, and closely monitor the cases. If local police fail to locate missing persons within four months, the responsibility will be transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs), known for their effectiveness in locating missing, runaway, and trafficked children."
Tracing, a big challenge
Social activist Sunitha Krishnan highlighted that individuals often leave their homes following disputes with parents over studies or behaviour. In cases of dysfunctional families or a lack of parental love and affection, children are inclined to abandon their homes. 
Sunitha Krishnan expressed concern that if they end up in unsafe environments like trafficking, begging rackets, or abduction, they become ensnared in criminal networks, making it challenging to trace them.
She noted, "For girls, the majority of cases involve elopement in the 12-16 age group, while children aged 3-7 are particularly vulnerable to abduction or kidnapping."
Despite these challenges, the social activist commended the swift intervention of Telangana police officials in missing cases, with some children being located within hours. She also emphasised that compared to other states, Telangana exhibits a higher awareness of missing cases.
