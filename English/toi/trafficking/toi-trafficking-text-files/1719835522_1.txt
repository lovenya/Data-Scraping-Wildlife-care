Pawan said Central intelligence sources have conveyed to him that the volunteer network developed by the AP government is involved in human trafficking. He said the volunteers who got complete data of people targeted women with financial difficulties and pushed them into human trafficking. “Why has Jagan not held a meet on the missing girls in AP, numbering around 29,000 according to NCRB data,” he questioned. Police have unofficially stated that 14,000 of these girls were traced. There is no answer when asked about the remaining 16,000 girls, he said.
