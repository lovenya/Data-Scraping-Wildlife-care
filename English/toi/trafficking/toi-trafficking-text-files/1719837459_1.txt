NEW DELHI: Following the sex trafficking lawsuit filed against WWE Chairman Vince McMahon on January 25, the wrestling industry is buzzing with speculation about how the company will address the situation. One particular question looming is whether WWE will hold a post-Royal Rumble press conference on Saturday.
As of now, there is no official confirmation about the press conference.Top Picks For YouBrock Lesnar's return at Royal Rumble 2024 faces uncertainty amid Vince McMahon lawsuitâ€‹WWE Royal Rumble 2024: Batista drops cryptic tease for epic returnFightful's Sean Ross Sapp indicated that the media assembled in Florida "expects" a press conference, but it hasn't been "technically" confirmed. However, some reports shed light on how the issue is being handled internally within WWE.

According to Dave Meltzer in the latest Wrestling Observer Newsletter, talent scheduled to meet with the media today in advance of the Royal Rumble was instructed to "lay low and not talk about anything other than the Royal Rumble or storyline-related things."
On the other hand, PWInsider's Mike Johnson reported that, as of Friday morning, WWE has not issued any internal statement to its employees regarding The Wall Street Journal article that detailed the sex trafficking lawsuit against Vince McMahon. Previous Wall Street Journal articles that implicated WWE in hush money scandals resulted in either a company meeting or a private statement. However, there has been no such communication this time.

The lack of an internal statement has left many employees surprised and concerned about the allegations. Despite the unsettling nature of the accusations, WWE talent appears to have been given limited guidance, with the directive to "lay low."
The Royal Rumble, one of WWE's premier events, is scheduled for Saturday night in Tampa. With talent interacting with the media ahead of the event, the approach of advising personnel to avoid discussing anything beyond the Royal Rumble or storyline-related matters has raised eyebrows within the wrestling community.
