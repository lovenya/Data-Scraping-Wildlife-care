Srinagar: J&K police’s State Investigation Agency (SIA) conducted searches Thursday at 18 locations in Srinagar in a “trans-national human trafficking case hatched by international terrorist organisations” to smuggle in foreign nationals, particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, under the guise of employment.
“Upon transportation to J&K, they (the foreigners) are sold to fake and illegal human resource agencies/consultancies under the garb of opportunities such as domestic helps, maids, and babysitters, often leading to sexual exploitation,” an SIA spokesperson said in a statement.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Special teams of the SIA, aided by Srinagar police, started the searches in the early hours, seizing from HR consultancies incriminating material and documents like ID cards, bank papers and registers, besides digital devices like mobile phones and computers.
According to SIA, “this nefarious scheme is part of a broader conspiracy by the terrorist organisations in connivance with trans-border human traffickers”. “These groups facilitate the infiltration of foreign nationals across international borders, concealing their original identities with forged Indian documents with an ultimate aim to establish sleeper cells to aid, execute, or facilitate terrorist acts in J&K,” the SIA said.
