CHENNAI: Sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested the kingpin of a human trafficking racket who was trying to send 61 Sri Lankan nationals abroad illegally after bringing them to India in 2021.
The absconder tracker team (ATT) of the NIA from Bengaluru arrested the accused, one Mohamed Imran Khan, 39, alias Haja Najerbheeden, a native of Ramanathpuram, from his hideout in Theni district.The NIA said it had been tracking his movements for a few months.
The NIA said Mohamed Imran Khan was a smuggler and wanted by several investigation agencies."He, along with a Sri Lankan national, Eesan, formerly associated with the LTTE, devised a plan to illegally transport 61 Sri Lankan nationals from the island nation to various locations in Tamil Nadu. They lured these people on false promises, including the prospect of obtaining legitimate documentation for emigration to Canada and securing employment," the NIA said.
NIA registered a case in 2021 after the Tamil Nadu Police's Q branch detained 23 Sri Lankan nationals and 4 agents in Madurai, which led to the detention of another 38 Sri Lankan nationals in Mangaluru. tnn
