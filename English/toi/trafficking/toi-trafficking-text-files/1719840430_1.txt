Singh said, "During the interrogation of the accused, it was found that they had met at a party organised by one of their friends. They had studied at a prominent institute in the city. Bhatia used to buy LSD from a dealer in Bengaluru through the dark web and then supply it to his customers in Dehradun."
Further probe led to the seizure of 2,058 blotters of LSD and an electronic weighing scale from the suspects. Additionally, two vehicles believed to have been used in the transportation of narcotics were impounded. Following their arrest, the accused were presented before the local court and remanded to judicial custody. Singh said, "A probe is on, to examine some important information received from them during the interrogation." Authorities are pursuing leads to unravel the extent of their operations.
