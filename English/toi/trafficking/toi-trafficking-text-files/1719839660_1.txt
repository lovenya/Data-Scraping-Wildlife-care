CHENNAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday arrested the absconding international drug trafficking kingpin Jaffer Sadiq in Delhi and said the investigation is underway regarding his financial linkages, including the sources of his funds and beneficiaries of the proceeds from the drugs.
NCB, after interrogating Jaffer Sadiq, a city-based businessman who was expelled from DMK after NCB named him as the kingpin of a drug cartel, said he earned a huge amount of money from his illicit drug trafficking operations and invested the same in legitimate businesses in industries like film, construction, and the hospitality sectors.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
"Jaffer Sadiq spearheaded a network that sourced Pseudoephedrine in India and trafficked it to Australia, New Zealand, and Malaysia in the guise of food-grade cargo. It is believed that the drug syndicate operated by him has sent 45 consignments over the past three years to various countries, containing approximately 3,500 kilograms of pseudoephedrine," said NCB.
The operations branch of NCB and the special cell of Delhi police on February 15 busted a godown in Delhi by arresting three persons, aides of Jaffer Sadiq, with 50 kg of pseudoephedrine. Since then, Jaffer Sadiq had been absconding, and NCB teams visited Chennai to summon him.
Nearly after 25 days, Jaffer Sadiq was arrested from his hideout in Delhi. NCB sleuths have also identified the packaging units where the controlled substance was packed to make it look like food grain powder. However, two more suspects, Mydeen and Salim, remain absconding.
