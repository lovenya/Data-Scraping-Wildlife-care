In a bid to enhance transparency and accountability at the southern border, House Republicans, spearheaded by Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, are introducing two bills aimed at addressing the influx of migrants into the US, reported Fox News. The issue of border security is rapidly gaining prominence in Congress, with Republicans urging reforms to the asylum system alongside additional funding for Ukraine.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
The first bill, known as the Preventing the Recycling of Immigrants is Necessary for Trafficking Suspension (PRINTS) Act, proposes granting Customs and Border Patrol agents the authority to collect fingerprints from minors aged 14 and younger. Advocates of the bill argue that it would combat child trafficking and prevent "recycling," where individuals falsely claim children as relatives to appear as a family unit while crossing the border.
Rep. Hinson emphasized the urgency of addressing the border crisis, stating, "There is nothing compassionate about an open border. The primary victims of President Biden’s border crisis are young children who are repeatedly abused and trafficked by the cartels." She highlighted the Biden administration's reported loss of over 85,000 migrant children, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., leading the PRINTS Act in the Senate alongside Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, underscored the gravity of child abuse at the border, expressing that the bill provides agents with "the tools they need to identify victims of child recycling and stop this abuse in its tracks."

The reports would be broken down by demographics and ethnicity, also requiring data on the number of migrants subjected to expedited removal, granted voluntary departure, or processed through other means.
Rep. Hinson contended that lax asylum laws during the Biden administration have contributed to the border crisis, stating, "This bill will require DHS to publish a full accounting of their catch-and-release practices and tell the American people the truth about the border crisis." The legislation reflects ongoing efforts to address the challenges at the southern border and ensure accountability in immigration processes.
