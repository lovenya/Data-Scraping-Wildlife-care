BHUBANESWAR: The commissionerate police have received an intelligence input about food delivery agents being engaged by drug traffickers to peddle ganja and brown sugar in the capital. Police commissioner Saumendra Priyadarsi said efforts are on to unmask the gang.
“We have kept a close watch on some drug smugglers, who have resorted to a modus operandi of engaging online food delivery agents to despatch narcotics substances.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWe are studying the trend to develop our counter strategy to curb the menace,” Priyadarsi said on the sidelines of a meeting convened by the state-level Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan committee here on Wednesday.
Police sources said peddlers have been posing as food delivery agents with T-shirts of their companies and delivery bags to hoodwink the police. However, no such gang involving food delivery agents carrying drugs has so far been busted in the city. All police stations have been asked to keep tabs on the suspicious movements of food delivery agents.
In August 2021, the city police had arrested two men in Saheed Nagar here for allegedly trying to smuggle ganja in two boxes with vaccines written on them, to Delhi with the help of a courier company.
