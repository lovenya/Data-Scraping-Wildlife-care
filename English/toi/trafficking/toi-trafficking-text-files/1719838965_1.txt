Nagpur: The anti-human trafficking unit (AHU) of the crime branch arrested six persons, including four women, who sold victims from the weaker economic section of the society to aspiring grooms in Gujarat for marriage on ‘contract basis’ against money. The women would be then sexually exploited by several members of the family.
Following a complaint filed by a 26-year-old woman, the AHU unit nabbed the masterminds of the rackets, Nanda Paunikar, her close aides Mangala Varkade, Ritu Bangali alias Rekha Khamari and Geeta Goyal alias Gajbhiye during the probe.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
Paunikar and Varkade had sold the survivor and two minors to a 65-year-old man in Rajkot in July last year. The complainant victim was sold off to a sanitation worker Santosh for marriage. She was later exploited by Santosh’s brothers too.
The survivor had later fled to Nagpur and approached the police following which the action was initiated.
Two fraudsters nabbed

Following evidence, the cops zeroed down upon Solanki and Rathod. They were handed over to Sitabuldi cops.
Bizman duped of ₹45 lakh
Vinaykumar Bhattad, a businessman, was duped of over ₹45 lakh by father-son duo Prashant (70) and Sarang (45) Kale between October 2019 and July 2023. The duo had lured Bhattad with a promise of lucrative returns on investments in different ventures.
Sources stated that the Kales had also furnished a cheque worth ₹45 lakh to Bhattad as security for his investment. When they were unable to deliver any profits to Bhattad, he had tried to encash the cheque given to him as security. The cheque bounced as the account was closed by the Kales by then.
