NEW DELHI: WWE and 2K Games disclosed the complete roster for the upcoming WWE 2K24 video game. However, the revelation came with notable omissions, as both Brock Lesnar and Vince McMahon were conspicuously absent from the list, marking a significant move by WWE to distance itself from the embroiled figures.
This decision comes in the wake of a sex trafficking lawsuit filed against Vince McMahon and WWE, implicating former WWE/UFC Heavyweight Champion, Brock Lesnar.Top Picks For Youâ€‹Gunther reacts as Sheamus eyes Intercontinental Championship ahead of his expected WWE returnBayley shares heartbreaking update ahead of WWE Elimination Chamber Premium Live EventThe Wall Street Journal identified Lesnar as the accused party on the same day the lawsuit was made public.


In response to the legal controversy, WWE swiftly terminated Lesnar's involvement in upcoming events, including matches at the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber, and WrestleMania 40. Additionally, Lesnar was removed from the WWE 2K Supercard mobile game, and his presence on the cover of the WWE 2K24 Forty Years of WrestleMania edition was replaced.

In a further effort to distance itself from the implicated wrestler, WWE edited Lesnar out of the introductory video package for its weekly television shows. These actions underscore WWE's proactive measures to preserve its public image amid the ongoing legal proceedings.
While the WWE 2K24 roster was initially revealed in stages over several days, the final list released today intentionally excludes Lesnar and McMahon. This strategic move reflects WWE's commitment to taking decisive steps in response to the controversy, prioritizing the company's image and distancing itself from individuals involved in the legal turmoil.
