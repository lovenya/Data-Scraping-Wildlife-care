Along with him, are some more cops from Navsari.
Left red-faced, the Surat and Navsari police have ordered a probe into the video.
According to details, the cultural event was organized for Sai temple by the Auto Rickshaw Drivers Association. As Goswami was posted in many police stations in Navsari earlier, he was also invited. During the programme, the uniformed cop went on the stage and joined the bootleggers in showering cash on the artists that included a female singer. The bootleggers also showered notes on Goswami, who seemed to enjoy the ‘rain’ with an impromptu ‘rain dance’.
