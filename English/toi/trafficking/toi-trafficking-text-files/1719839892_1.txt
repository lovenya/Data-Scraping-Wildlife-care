Rapper 50 Cent has reacted to the shocking news of the raids conducted by armed agents from the Department of Homeland Security on luxury properties owned by Sean 'Diddy' Combs. 
The rapper took to his social media handles to share a news snippet of the raids and said, "Now it’s not Diddy do it, it’s Diddy done. they don’t come like that unless they got a case."
Sharing another report alleging that the rapper has fled the United States in his private jet, he said, "Oh this shit is a movie.I told yall but no, ya didn’t listen." The post in question featured a viral tweet that read, "Breaking: Private jet owned by Sean 'P Diddy' Combs has left the US. Combs' residences were raided by DHS in connection with a sex trafficking investigation. The flight path of the plane appears to be headed towards Cape Verde. Cape Verde has no extradition treaty with the US."


Homes belonging to Diddy were raided by federal agents on Monday. "Earlier today, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York executed law enforcement actions as part of an ongoing investigation, with assistance from HSI Los Angeles, HSI Miami and our local law enforcement partners," a statement carried by US media said.

TMZ and other news outlets carried footage of a raid on the hip-hop mogul's luxury waterside property in Miami. There was no immediate official confirmation about what precipitated the raids.
However, this raid comes at a time when the rapper is at the centre of sex trafficking and sex assault lawsuits. Currently, there are at least four lawsuits filed against him, with allegations dating back decades. In December a woman accused Combs of sexual assault, alleging he and others gang-raped her when she was 17.
Combs has vehemently denied all accusations against him.
