GUWAHATI: A16-year-old girl of Assam's Udalguri district, who was trafficked to Delhi by two agents belonging to Rajasthan and Delhi about four months ago, was rescued from Gurgaon, police said on Tuesday.
Police have arrested both the accused on Tuesday based on the statement of the rescued minor, who is being brought to her home after due procedures. 
Udalguri superintendent of police Pushkin Jain said, "As per preliminary investigation, the accused have been working as agents of trafficking gangs operating from outside the state, in different districts of Assam for the last couple of years with the help of some local links.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAn investigation is under way to find out further linkages."
He added that the accused had taken the girl, who belongs to an underprivileged family, promising her a profitable job in Delhi. "She was rescued by a social worker, who works as a representative to the northeast in Delhi police," he added.

Accordingly, Narula took the initiative and rescued her from Nathupur in Gurgaon.
"The agent, who had trafficked her to Delhi from Assam, was not in Gurgaon on the day the girl was rescued. The agent returned to Assam," she added.
Jain added that the traffickers usually take the help of local links and target the economically weaker families, who are also less educated, and lure them with profitable jobs outside the state. "Education is necessary to stop trafficking. The anti-trafficking unit of Udalguri police has been actively working in the district. We rescued two trafficked women from Delhi and one from Bhopal last month," he added.
