VIJAYAWADA: Trafficking survivors and victims of commercial sexual exploitation have demanded the state government to take measures to ensure social security through necessary changes in the existing GO.MS.No. 1/2003 to enabling them to access the benefits under AP's Nava Ratnaalu welfare schemes.
Requests came after the state announced a new policy aimed at providing social security to transgenders.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoAs part of the trans-inclusive policy, the government will offer medical and education facilities to the third gender.
