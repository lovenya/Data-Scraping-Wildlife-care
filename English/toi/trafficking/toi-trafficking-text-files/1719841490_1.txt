NIA investigations have revealed that the suspects were allegedly handling the victims in trafficking, and also managing their logistics and recruitment to a cyber frauds company at Laos.
The human trafficking syndicate under the scanner was operating from Gurugram and other regions within and outside India. It related to the recruitment, transportation and transfer of the victims from India to the Golden Triangle SEZ in Laos.
Initial investigations in the case, originally registered by Gurugram police and taken over by NIA earlier this month, have revealed that the suspects whose premises were searched today had been working for accused Balwant alias Bobby Kataria, owner of MBK Global Visa Pvt.
