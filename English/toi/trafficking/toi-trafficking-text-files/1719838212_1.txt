Bollywood's ace filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani is currently enjoying the success of his recently released 'Dunki', starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role. The film has so far earned a global gross of over Rs 340 crore in just nine days.
A recent incident involving a charter plane carrying 276 passengers, mostly Indians, was grounded in France for four days due to suspected human trafficking, before being sent back to Mumbai, has once again brought attention to the subject.
While speaking about the same, in an interview with NDTV, Rajkumar Hirani explained that such reports surface every month. Not a single month goes by without reports of people crossing borders in such ways, he stated. He added that since we are more aware of this now, it immediately captures our attention when it makes the news.
The filmmaker added that in Dunki, the flashback is set in 1995. He said that several countries provide Indians with visa upon arrival. So the method to illegally immigrate has changed. According to him, in the past, people used to physically cross borders from India to Pakistan, then to Afghanistan, followed by Turkey. From there, they would travel by boat to Greece, then move on to Italy and then France. This was one of the donkey routes. Sometimes people also went through Russia, he revealed.
