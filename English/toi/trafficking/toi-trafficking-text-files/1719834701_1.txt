STF DIG Partha Sarathi Mahanta, during a press conference in Guwahati on Monday, said the operation was conducted in compliance with chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s directions to catch the brokers who facilitate the Rohingya infiltrators in order to break the backbone of the racket. The operation was conducted from July 28 to Saturday.
Five police teams were deputed to various bordering districts of Tripura in connection with a case registered with the STF under various charges, including criminal conspiracy, cheating, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and forgery.
“During the operation, the arrested persons were found to be involved in helping the Rohingya refugees to enter Indian territory illegally and providing fake IDs and other documents to show them as Indians. It is a major threat to national security,” he added.
