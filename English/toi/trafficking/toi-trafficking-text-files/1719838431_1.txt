AGARTALA: In a coordinated operation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a crackdown in five bordering locations, including Unokoti district, West Tripura, Khowai, Sepahijala, and South Tripura districts. The operation aimed to apprehend human traffickers, intermediaries, and cross-border criminals, resulting in the arrest of 20 individuals.

According to insider sources, a substantial NIA team arrived in the area with specific information concerning a significant number of Tripura residents involved in human trafficking and facilitating the illegal movement of migrants, particularly Rohingya refugees, from Bangladesh.
Notably, the NIA did not inform the Tripura police about their operation and did not request additional security. Nevertheless, sources within the state's home department indicated that the investigating team conducted early morning operations and apprehended at least 20 individuals, with a target list of around 50 suspects.
These arrested individuals are believed to have played a role in facilitating illegal border crossings and cross-border movement along the Tripura-Bangladesh border. Tripura has previously been identified as a corridor for human trafficking from Bangladesh and the smuggling of drugs. Over the past three years, numerous migrants from African countries have also entered India through Bangladesh, apart from Rohingya and Bangladeshi nationals.
Sources from security agencies stated that the apprehended individuals would be presented before a special NIA Court in the near future. This coordinated effort is part of a broader strategy to dismantle human trafficking networks. The NIA initiated simultaneous raids in ten states on Tuesday, targeting suspects involved in similar criminal activities.
In addition to Tripura, the NIA reportedly conducted similar operations in ten other states, including Assam, West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Haryana, Pondicherry, Rajasthan, and Jammu and Kashmir.
A senior official from the intelligence agency revealed that approximately 80% of the notorious border criminals who served as facilitators for infiltrators were arrested during these raids. However, some individuals managed to evade arrest by remaining elusive during the special operations.
