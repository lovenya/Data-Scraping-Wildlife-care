NEW DELHI: The WWE universe finds itself embroiled in a storm of controversy as Vince McMahon faces serious allegations of sexual trafficking and misconduct, brought forth by Janel Grant.

In the ongoing legal battle, Janel Grant accuses Vince McMahon of distributing explicit content of her without consent, implicating other WWE personnel, undisclosed executives, and wrestling stars in her lawsuit.


John Cena, known as the Cenation Leader, recently expressed his continued respect and admiration for McMahon, emphasizing their years of association within the Stamford-based promotion. Cena's statement, particularly his remark about still loving McMahon, has ignited strong reactions from various quarters, with many questioning the appropriateness of such sentiments given the severity of the allegations.
Former WWE manager Dutch Mantell shared his perspective on the situation during an episode of Smack Talk, suggesting that John Cena might have been better off distancing himself from the controversy. Mantell expressed the opinion that Cena's comments, while acknowledging McMahon's past contributions, could be interpreted as avoiding the core issue at hand.

“I think he [John Cena] would have been better off by just trying to distance himself from the situation,” Mantell said. “Maybe not distance himself from Vince, but here he’s saying, I don’t know what he’s saying, to tell you the truth, you can put any kind of damn explanation to it you want. What he’s trying to say is, ‘I wish this hadn’t have happened. This is not the Vince I love. Vince made me 30 million or 40 or 50 million dollars, so I appreciate him there.'”
John Cena, absent from WWE television since Crown Jewel last year, remains grateful for McMahon’s support, and his comments align with that sentiment. The unfolding situation raises questions about the potential impact on Vince McMahon's standing within the company and the broader wrestling community.
