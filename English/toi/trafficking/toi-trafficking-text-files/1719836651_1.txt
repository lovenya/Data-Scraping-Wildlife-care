The courts cannot be the panacea for every problem in society and they cannot take over the work of government and administration, the Supreme Court on Friday said and refused to entertain a PIL seeking its directions for crackdown on illegal organ trafficking in the country, citing its limitation. 
Underscoring that the judiciary cannot do what is supposed to be done by other organs of the state, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia said, "We cannot take over everything.Are we supposed to look into all scams? We cannot take over the administration or the job of police. Court is not the panacea for all evils." The court agreed that the issue raised by the petitioner was serious but expressed its limitation in interfering. It, howev-er, asked the Centre to look into it and take necessary steps.
