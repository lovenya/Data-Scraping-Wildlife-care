BERLIN: German investigators arrested 10 people in nationwide raids on Wednesday, over suspicions they were part of a network smuggling in wealthy migrants from China and the Arab world.
Prosecutors identified the alleged ringleaders as a pair of lawyers, who charged "wealthy nationals of China and the Arab world" between 30,000 and 350,000 euros ($32,000 and $373,000) each to obtain permanent residence in Germany.

More than 1,000 police officers were mobilised in the search of 101 properties, including two legal practices and the district offices where residence permits were issued.
German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said such "high pressure" was necessary against criminal gangs.
