"The operation was aimed at dismantling human trafficking support networks involved in infiltration and settlement of illegal migrants across the Indo-Bangladesh border into India," said an NIA official.
 An Assam police Special Task Force had, in September, registered a case of trafficking illegal migrants from Bangladesh including those of Rohingya origin. Later investigation revealed that the network had expanded its operations, prompting NIA to take over the case, a source said. Human trafficking cases were registered at the NIA branches in Guwahati, Chennai, Bengaluru and Jaipur and searches were carried out.
