NEW DELHI: Vince McMahon, the iconic figure behind WWE, is notably absent and conspicuously omitted from recent WWE events following allegations of sexual trafficking and misconduct lodged against him by former WWE employee Janel Grant. These accusations have sent shockwaves through the wrestling community and, according to reports, led to McMahon's resignation from WWE.Top Picks For YouRevealed: Was Cody Rhodes supposed to win Men's Royal Rumble Match?WWE NXT superstars set to get SmackDown call-ups
Janel Grant's lawsuit alleges explicit content sharing without her consent, involving McMahon and other WWE personnel. The legal action further claims that McMahon instructed her to engage in sexual activities with certain individuals connected to the organization.


In the wake of these serious allegations, McMahon's departure from WWE seems to have taken a different turn compared to his previous exit during the hush money scandal. Dave Meltzer, speaking on Wrestling Observer Radio, highlighted the intriguing contrast in WWE's approach to McMahon's departure this time. Unlike the earlier exit, McMahon's name has been conspicuously erased from recent WWE events, including press conferences and SmackDown episodes.
Meltzer noted that the absence of McMahon's name from the narrative is peculiar, especially given the historically observed boost in short-term ratings associated with negative news concerning him. The deliberate decision by WWE to omit McMahon's name from recent events suggests a strategic move on the organization's part.
"He's been erased. I mean, Paul Levesque [Triple H] never mentioned his name at the press conference. On the Friday SmackDown show, they never mentioned his name. I don't think that anyone's going to mention his name on any shows, maybe ever again, at least not for the foreseeable future."

Meltzer expressed skepticism about the likelihood of McMahon's name being mentioned in the foreseeable future, except in historical contexts due to his significant impact on WWE's history.
While the situation unfolds, Janel Grant's lawyer anticipates more individuals speaking out against WWE's alleged culture of corruption. The wrestling community remains on edge, awaiting further developments and the potential long-term implications for Vince McMahon and WWE.
