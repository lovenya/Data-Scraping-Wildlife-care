In a recent case on May 24, eight women were rescued from Oman with the efforts of Rajya Sabha member Vikramjit Singh Sahney and re-united with their families at the New Delhi international airport. In a similar case, Sahney had earlier this month also rescued seven more women with the help of the Indian Embassy in Oman. These women were sent to Oman by travel agents with the promise of good salary to work as domestic or office help but as soon as they land in Oman, they are dispossessed of their passports and mobile phones, and are treated as slaves.
