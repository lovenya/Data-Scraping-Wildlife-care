NEW DELHI: France on Friday grounded a Nicaragua-bound plane carrying more than 300 Indian passengers over suspected "human trafficking".
The aircraft carrying passengers "likely to be victims of human trafficking" was detained on Thursday after an anonymous tipoff, the Paris public prosecutor's office told AFP.
The plane had taken off from the United Arab Emirates.
Meanwhile, the Indian embassy in France said that the authorities have sought consular access and are investigating the situation.
"French authorities informed us of a plane w/ 303 people, mostly Indian origin, from Dubai to Nicaragua detained on a technical halt at a French airport. Embassy team has reached & obtained consular access. We are investigating the situation, also ensuring wellbeing of passengers," the Indian embassy said on X, formerly Twitter.
Prosecutors have confirmed that the investigation has been assumed by the national anti-organized crime unit, JUNALCO.
The prefecture in the northeastern department of Marne said the A340, operated by Romanian company Legend Airlines, "remained grounded on the tarmac at Vatry airport following its landing".
The plane had been due to refuel and was carrying 303 Indian nationals, it said.
The office of the prefect said that the reception area at Vatry airport was converted into a waiting space equipped with separate beds to ensure optimal conditions for accommodating the passengers.
The Paris public prosecution office has reported that a specialized unit focusing on organized crime is probing potential human trafficking suspicions. Two individuals have been taken into custody for interrogation in connection with this case.
