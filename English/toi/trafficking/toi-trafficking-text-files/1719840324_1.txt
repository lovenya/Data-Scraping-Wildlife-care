INDORE: In the biggest seizure in Indore, Pardeshipura police on Friday busted a drug trafficking network and seized 7.65 kg brown sugar worth Rs 7.6 crore from a man and his son-in-law who were transporting it to Howrah of West Bengal from Rajasthan. Officials believe that the drugs were being smuggled to Bangladesh or Myanmar through West Bengal.
Additional commissioner Amit Singh said that Interpol and the state agencies including CBN and NCB have been informed about the seizure and joint efforts are being made to find out where the drugs were destined.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHe said constables at Pardeshipura police station intercepted two individuals near the Bheru Baba temple during routine checks on Thursday night, leading to the discovery of a sizable haul of brown sugar.
“Upon inquiry, they claimed to be in Indore for a relative's funeral rites, but their vague responses raised red flags. Upon closer examination of the bag, officers discovered a concealed compartment stitched with a thread. Inside were eight plastic bags containing a light brown, powdery substance later identified as brown sugar,” said Singh.
He added that Prasram, son of Laluram Meghwal, 39, resident of Barotha in Pratapgarh of Rajasthan and his son-in-law Dharmendra, son of Laluji Chouhan, 26, resident of Taal in Ratlam were arrested and booked under relevant sections of the NDPS Act and further investigations have been initiated against them. During interrogations, the accused accepted smuggling brown sugar from Rajasthan to West Bengal twice before for Rs 10,000. The accused were produced before the court and taken in for further questioning.
