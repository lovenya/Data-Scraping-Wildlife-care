NEW DELHI: José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious leader of the Ecuadorian gang Los Choneros, was recently found missing from his prison cell, where he was serving a sentence for drug trafficking.
He is believed to have escaped from his cell before his transfer to a maximum security prison where he would be held in isolation, though no official in Ecuador has used the word “escape.” Authorities refer to his absence from his cell, leaving it unconfirmed whether he actually escaped.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
His disappearance led to a state of emergency declaration by the government, involving military deployment in prisons. This action triggered over 30 violent incidents across Ecuador, including a shocking live broadcast assault at a Guayaquil TV station.
"Fito," as José Adolfo Macías Villamar is commonly known, was born in Manta, a coastal city in Manabí province, 44 years ago. This city is also recognized as the birthplace of the notorious gang Los Choneros. Macías, with his distinctive look has become an infamous figure in a nation plagued by violence.
Despite his modest beginnings in Manta, Macías has amassed a lengthy criminal record. He faces a multitude of charges, including robbery, murder, manslaughter, illicit association, organized crime, weapon possession, assault on life, and property crimes. These charges, numbering at least 30, are documented by the judiciary of Ecuador.
Macías is currently listed among Ecuador's most wanted criminals. Known for his distinctive appearance, including a beard, wavy hair, a protruding belly, and a heavy build, Macías has become a well-recognized figure in a country plagued by violence.
Despite his humble beginnings in Manta, Macías has accumulated an extensive criminal record, facing at least 30 charges ranging from robbery and murder to organized crime and possession of weapons. He is currently on Ecuador's most wanted list, with a reward for information leading to his capture.
His mother, Marisol Villamar, insists on his innocence, saying in a 2017 interview with El Diario de Manta, "He’s being investigated for everything. They accuse him of selling drugs, stealing cars and even of stealing chickens. For everything that happens in Manta they want to hold him responsible."
Following the death of Los Choneros' former boss, José Luis Zambrano, alias "Rasquiña," in December 2020, Macías and Junior Roldán took over the gang's leadership. However, Roldán's subsequent death left Macías as the sole leader. The gang, now classified as a terrorist organization by Ecuadorian authorities, is believed to control drug trafficking routes along the Pacific coast and has connections with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel.
Los Choneros, originating in the 1990s, has a significant presence in prison pavilions. The death of Rasquiña led to a power struggle with former allies, intensifying gang violence.
Ecuador's President recently criticized Macías' luxurious prison conditions, noting that his cell had more electric outlets than a hotel room. Macías, known for flaunting his prison privileges on social media, enjoyed various amenities during his incarceration, including parties, prohibited items, and even a decorated bathroom.
Macías' last public message, a video released in July 2023, showed him surrounded by armed men and a coerced police officer. He also appeared in a Mexican corrido, produced by his daughter, praising him as a benevolent leader.
Authorities are uncertain about the details of Macías' disappearance, including when and how he left his cell. This incident marks the second time he has vanished from custody, the first being in 2013.
President Noboa acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding Macías' whereabouts, admitting the possibility of a falsified prison roll call list.
