PARIS: A Nicaragua-bound flight carrying 303 passengers, mostly Indians, was allowed to resume its journey on Monday three days after they were detained by the French authorities at an airport near Paris over suspected "human trafficking", according to local media reports on Sunday.
After authorising the A340 aircraft, operated by Romanian company Legend Airlines, to leave, the French judges chose to cancel the hearings of the passengers due to irregularities in procedure, BFM TV, a French network said.
Four French judges earlier in the day began questioning the passengers detained by the French authorities at Vatry airport, 150km east of Paris, since Thursday over suspected "human trafficking".
The hearings were conducted as part of the investigation opened by the Paris prosecutor's office on suspicion of human trafficking.
The plane is expected to take off again on Monday morning. Its destination is not yet known. It could travel to India, where the passengers are from, to Nicaragua, its original destination, or to Dubai, from where it took off.
According to the French media, some of the passengers spoke Hindi and others Tamil and are believed to have contacted their families by telephone. Ten of the passengers have requested asylum, the newspaper quoted a source close to the case as saying.
The plane includes 11 unaccompanied minors and two passengers in custody since Friday had their detention extended on Saturday evening for up to 48 hours, according to French prosecutors. 
On Saturday, India's embassy in France said its staff are at the airport to ensure the welfare of Indian nationals. In an updated message on social media on Saturday evening, the embassy thanked French authorities for working over the long Christmas holiday weekend in pursuit of an "early resolution" of the situation.
