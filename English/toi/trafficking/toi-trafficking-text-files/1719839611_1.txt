A rare and endangered red panda was among 87 live animals that were seized by Thai customs officials at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on March 6, 2024. The animals were found hidden in the checked luggage of six Indian nationals who were attempting to smuggle them out of the country and fly to Mumbai.
Native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China, the red panda, often referred to as the lesser panda or the red cat-bear, is a captivating small mammal admired for its distinctive appearance and gentle demeanor.Despite its endearing charm, this species faces significant threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and inbreeding, leading to its alarming status as endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). With only an estimated 10,000 individuals remaining in the wild, urgent conservation efforts are essential to safeguard this enchanting species from further decline.
The red panda was not the only exotic animal that the smugglers had in their possession. The other animals included 29 chameleons, 21 snakes, 15 birds, 7 monitor lizards, 4 skinks, 2 red-eye squirrels, 2 bats, 2 cotton-top monkeys, 1 tiger fish, 1 Sulawesi bear cuscus, 1 frog, and 1 rat. Some of these animals are also endangered or threatened, such as the cotton-top tamarin, which is critically endangered, and the Sulawesi bear cuscus, which is vulnerable .

The animals were concealed in plastic containers, wicker baskets, and bags inside the luggage. The smugglers had drilled air holes in some of the containers, but the conditions were still cramped and stressful for the animals. Some of the animals were also sedated to prevent them from making noise or moving.
The smugglers were arrested and charged with violating the Customs Act, the Wildlife Conservation and Protection Act, and the Animal Epidemics Act. They face up to 10 years in prison or four times the amount of import duties. The animals were transferred to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation for further examination and care.
Thailand is a major transit hub for wildlife smugglers, who often sell the animals in China and Vietnam, where there is a high demand for exotic pets, traditional medicine, and meat. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in trafficking to India, where some of the animals are used for religious rituals or entertainment.
Wildlife trafficking is one of the most lucrative and destructive illegal trades in the world, worth an estimated $100 to $150 billion per year. It poses a serious threat to the survival of many species, as well as to the health and security of humans and the environment. The seizure of the red panda and other animals at the Thai airport is a rare success story in the fight against this global crime.
