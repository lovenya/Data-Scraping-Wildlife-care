Amritsar: Five Punjabis, including a woman, are among 22 people arrested by the US on charges of sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking in a four-day ‘Bad Barbie’ sting operation in California’s Kern county.
US rights activists and Punjab Foundation chairman Sukhi Chahal said: “The five arrested Punjabis — Jaswinder Singh (35), Joginder Singh (54), Rajinder Singh (54), Nishan Singh (33) and Karnail Singh (44) — have shocked and disgraced the community.”
 California attorney general Rob Bonta issued a press release, which reads that: “Sexual exploitation and the human trafficking of children will not be tolerated in California.”
The release also quoted Bakersfield police chief Greg Terry as saying that: “These operations are vital to the safety of our children and families.Even though largely hidden from view, human trafficking occurs in our community. There is no typical victim, but they are often its most vulnerable members. The perpetrators will be held accountable.”
