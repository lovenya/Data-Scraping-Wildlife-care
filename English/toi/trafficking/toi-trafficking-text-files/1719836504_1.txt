Newly obtained body camera video sheds light on the arrest of Michael Masterson, a former University of Dayton administrator, during a statewide human trafficking sting operation, reported WHIO. The video reveals critical moments of Masterson's apprehension, highlighting the gravity of the situation.
News Center 7 initially reported Masterson's arrest earlier this week, when he was among the 160 individuals apprehended in a statewide sting operation conducted by law enforcement agencies, as disclosed by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNo
The body camera footage, obtained exclusively by the I-Team, captures the tense scene of Masterson's arrest, which took place at precisely 2:58 p.m. last Wednesday. In the video, an arresting officer can be heard commanding, "Hands up!" as law enforcement officers swiftly place him in handcuffs. Masterson faced allegations of attempting to purchase sex during the sting operation.
Surprisingly, sources close to the situation informed the I-Team that Masterson was teaching at the University of Dayton as recently as last Thursday, a day after his arrest. However, an email acquired by the I-Team revealed that some students were notified on Monday morning that Masterson would no longer be their instructor.

Attorney General Yost informed lead investigator John Bedell that Masterson held the title of "Director of Excellence." Curiously, the provided links now lead to messages indicating that they are no longer available on the university's website.
In response to inquiries, the I-Team reached out to the University of Dayton, which confirmed that Masterson is now considered a "former faculty member." The university declined to comment further, stating, "The University does not comment on individual personnel matters or ongoing investigations. The University considers this a law enforcement issue and defers to their handling of it."
As of Wednesday, a check by investigator John Bedell on the cases of Masterson and other men arrested in Montgomery County during the sting operation, including two members of the United States Air Force, revealed that all cases are currently listed as "no charge." This designation implies that formal charges have not yet been filed against these individuals, leaving their legal status in limbo.
The unfolding details surrounding Michael Masterson's arrest continue to raise questions, not only about his alleged involvement but also about the university's handling of the situation. The investigation into this statewide human trafficking sting operation remains ongoing, and further developments are anticipated in the coming days.
