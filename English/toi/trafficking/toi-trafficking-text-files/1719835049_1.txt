NEW DELHI: Eight years after a 14-year-old girl went missing, the anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) of the Central district has managed to recover her from Delhi Cantonment. Police said the girl was not happy with her family, so she left the house and went to Rajasthan.
DCP (Central) Sanjay Sain said while investigating missing people cases, they came across a case where a girl had been missing from her house since 2014.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoHer family was contacted, and a fresh inquiry was launched. "The girl was 14 years old when she went missing. All the records available in the case file, including CCTV footage, were examined. A fresh search operation was then launched by the team. They visited different shelter homes for girls in Delhi and NCR and also red-light areas," the officer said.
On the basis of the inquiry, it emerged that the girl was in touch with a family member through her mobile phone. "Technical surveillance was mounted on the phone number, and it emerged that the location of the number was in the Delhi Cantt area. The AHTU team went to Delhi Cantt and searched for the girl on the basis of a photograph and other available information, and finally they were able to trace the girl," the officer said. 
The team was led by inspector VN Jha. After proper verification, the girl was handed over to her family. Her medical examination was conducted and a statement taken.
