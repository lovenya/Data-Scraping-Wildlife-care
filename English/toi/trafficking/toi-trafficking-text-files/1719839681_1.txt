NEW DELHI: Brock Lesnar has made a comeback to the WWE roster page on the official website, signaling a potential return to in-ring action. The 10-time WWE World Champion found himself entangled in legal complications following his inclusion in Janel Grant's lawsuit against WWE, Vince McMahon, and John Laurinaitis. This led to Lesnar being excluded from creative plans and promotional material, including the Royal Rumble.Top Picks For YouThe Rock congratulates WWE on hitting new milestoneWWE legend The Undertaker set for WrestleMania week with '1 deadMAN SHOW' in Philadelphia
Lesnar's absence from the Royal Rumble, a significant event where his return was anticipated, sparked speculation about his future with the company. Additionally, he was removed from promotional materials for WWE 2K24 and the WWE 2K Supercard mobile game. However, WWE's recent decision to reinstate Lesnar on the roster page indicates a potential resolution to the legal issues surrounding him.


The official WWE website now features Lesnar's name in the list of champions, suggesting that the company may have cleared him of any wrongdoing. This move comes as a positive development for Lesnar, who has been absent from WWE action since his loss to Cody Rhodes at WWE's SummerSlam in 2023.
Despite earlier plans for Lesnar's involvement in the Royal Rumble, those intentions were redirected following the public disclosure of the lawsuit. The spot intended for Lesnar was given to Bron Breakker, altering the course of the event. The lawsuit also affected Lesnar's potential matchups, including a planned encounter with Dominik Mysterio at Elimination Chamber and a proposed WrestleMania 40 showdown with Intercontinental Champion Gunther.

Gunther, WWE's current and longest-serving Intercontinental Champion, has expressed eagerness to face Lesnar in the ring. The Austrian powerhouse, known for his dominance in the current WWE roster, sees Lesnar as a legendary opponent and has openly conveyed his admiration for Lesnar's contributions to the wrestling industry.
Lesnar's return to the WWE roster has sparked curiosity among fans, leaving them eager to witness the potential matchups and storylines that may unfold as the Beast Incarnate makes his presence felt once again.
