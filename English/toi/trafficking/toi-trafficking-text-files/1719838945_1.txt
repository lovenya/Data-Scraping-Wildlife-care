NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is interrogating the Indian passengers who arrived in Mumbai on Tuesday morning days after French authorities grounded their flight over 'trafficking' concerns.
While some passengers were allowed to leave after brief interrogation by the CISF officials, others are still being questioned.
A charter plane, with 276 passengers on board, landed at Mumbai's Chattrapati Shivaji International Airport in the wee hours on Tuesday.On leaving the airport after arriving from France, passengers tried their best to avoid queries from the waiting media.
While 25 people, including two minors, had expressed their wish to apply for asylum, two were held, produced before a judge and placed on assisted witness status.
The aircraft, which was ground by French authorities last week, was headed to Nicaragua. It was grounded 'on a technical halt' at the Vatry airport in France. The flight, with 303 passengers, was headed from Dubai to Nicaragua.
French authorities had launched a judicial investigation into the conditions and purpose of the trip, with a unit specialising in organised crime investigating suspected human trafficking. Nicaragua has become a popular destination for those seeking asylum in the US. 
Earlier on Monday, the Indian embassy in France thanked the French government and the Vatry Airport authorities for their hospitality and quick resolution of the situation that allowed Indian passengers to return home.
"Thank French Gov and Vatry Airport for quick resolution of the situation enabling Indian passengers to return home & hospitality. Also for working closely with embassy team, present throughout at the site to ensure welfare and smooth & safe return. Thank agencies in India, too," the Indian embassy in France said in a post on X.

The embassy also hailed the cooperation of French authorities for working closely with the embassy team and ensuring the safe return of citizens.
