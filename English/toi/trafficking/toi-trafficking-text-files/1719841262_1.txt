Four members of the Hinduja family, the richest in the UK, are facing charges in Switzerland related to the treatment of their domestic staff. 
The allegations include exploitation and human trafficking, with claims that servants from India were paid low wages, worked long hours, and had their passports confiscated.
The trial has brought to light the stark contrast between the family's alleged spending on their dog and the daily wages of their servants.The prosecution claims the Hindujas paid one staff member just seven Swiss francs (approximately £6.19) for an 18-hour workday, while spending 8,584 francs (£7,616) on their pet dog annually.
Prosecutor Yves Bertossa highlighted this disparity in court, while the Hindujas' lawyers argued that the wages should be considered in the context of the staff receiving accommodation and food. They also disputed the claim of long working hours, suggesting that activities like watching a film with the children should not be classified as work.

However, the allegations of passport confiscation and restricted freedom of movement are serious and could be deemed as human trafficking.

Previous incidents, such as the arrest of Hannibal Gaddafi in 2008 and a recent case involving domestic workers from the Philippines, have also drawn attention to this dark side of the city.
