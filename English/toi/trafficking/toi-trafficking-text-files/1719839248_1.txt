He stated, "If someone’s behavior lies so far outside your value system... I can’t operate in a world where this works, that’s the end result of being accountable."

He concluded by stating his love for McMahon and the desire to help WWE navigate through the challenging situation.
Randy Orton, in an interview with SI's Justin Barrasso, shared his sentiments about the allegations, expressing how deeply it affected him. While acknowledging McMahon's role in his career, Orton conveyed the emotional impact of the revelations, stating, "What you’ve seen and read, I’ve seen and read. As far as commenting on that, it f****** hurts my heart."

Orton shifted the focus to WWE's current leadership, praising WWE President Nick Khan and Chief Content Creator Paul 'Triple H' Levesque for cultivating a safer culture within the company. He highlighted positive changes, including a more supportive approach towards talent's well-being, which he believes has significantly improved the overall climate within WWE.
Both Cena and Orton's responses reflect a delicate balance between acknowledging McMahon's impact on their careers and grappling with the troubling allegations. While Cena emphasized accountability and potential reevaluation of his relationship with McMahon, Orton expressed his deep emotional response and optimism about positive changes within WWE's current leadership.
