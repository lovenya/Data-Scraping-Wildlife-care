Vijayawada: The survivors of human trafficking are not getting enough support from the government for their socio-economic empowerment and they are kept in shelter homes for years in the name of rehabilitation. 
According to NCRB, from 2015 to 2021, about 2,500 victims were rescued from trafficking in state. However, only 15 of them received compensation through Nirbhaya fund under the NALSA scheme.At least 20 per cent of the rescued victims were not able to avail of rehabilitation support along with the social entitlements under GO.MS.No. 1/2003 which is the failure of the government, alleged a forum for the survivors. 
According to Vimukthi, a state level forum for survivors of trafficking and victims of commercial sexual exploitation, the rescued survivors should be facilitated with enough support. “They should be empowered through ‘community based rehabilitation’ beyond following the existing age-old institutionalisation system where they are being coarsely detained for months and years in shelter homes in the name of rehabilitation and empowerment,” asserted N Apoorva and B Pushpavathi who are the president and secretary, respectively, of the forum.
