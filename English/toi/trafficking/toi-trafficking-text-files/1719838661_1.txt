NEW DELHI: Following Vince McMahon's resignation from the board of WWE's parent company, TKO Group Holdings, amidst allegations of sex trafficking, sexual assault, and physical abuse, Triple H (Paul Levesque), the chief content officer at World Wrestling Entertainment, made his first public comments during a news conference after WWE's "Royal Rumble" event in St.Top Picks For YouWWE Royal Rumble 2024: Highlights, surprises, and resultsâ€‹Bayley wins historic WWE Women's Royal Rumble 2024: 3 key talking pointsPetersburg, Florida.
Levesque, who is McMahon's son-in-law, stated that he had not read the lawsuit and had no prior knowledge of it, emphasizing that he does not "want to get bogged down into that." During the news conference, he asserted that he is doing "everything possible" to ensure employees are not taken advantage of and feel safe at work. However, specific details about the measures taken by WWE were not provided.


The allegations against Vince McMahon were brought forward by Janel Grant, a former employee at WWE's headquarters, who accused McMahon of promising job opportunities and promotions at WWE in exchange for sex. The lawsuit also includes allegations of McMahon trafficking Grant to other men inside and outside the company, including John Laurinaitis, a former wrestler and WWE employee, who is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
Vince McMahon, 78, has denied the allegations and expressed his readiness to defend himself in court. He retired from his role in July 2022 amid a WWE-appointed special committee investigation into alleged misconduct during his tenure as chairman and CEO. Laurinaitis left the company shortly thereafter.

McMahon returned as chair of TKO in early 2023, and in September of the same year, WWE officially merged with a portion of Ari Emanuel's Endeavor group, the parent company of UFC, to form TKO. The deal valued the combined company at over $21 billion, with WWE shareholders owning 49%.
The winner of the men's Royal Rumble, Cody Rhodes, commented during the news conference that the allegations cast "a dark cloud" over the company, expressing uncertainty about what the next chapter for WWE would look like.
