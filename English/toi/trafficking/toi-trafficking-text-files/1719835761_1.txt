“The development comes in less than a month after the Jalandhar Rural police had arrested drug smuggler Joga Singh, who swam into the Pakistan territory to retrieve the heroin consignment and 8kg contraband was seized from him. Earlier, the state special operation cell, Amritsar, had nabbed drug smuggler identified as Shinder Singh with 10kg heroin and Rs 1.5 lakh drug money in his possession,” he added.
“A woman drug smuggler, Amandeep Kaur ‘Deep Bhai’, linked with this module, was also arrested with 1kg heroin, while one Shinderpal ‘Pappu’ was caught with 500g heroin from Mehatpur,” the DGP said. By tracking forward and backwards linkages in this case, Jalandhar rural police had arrested Kali, a resident of Tendi Wala village in Ferozepur district, from Boparai canal bridge near Goraya, he said.
