NEW DELHI: Two men were apprehended by the Delhi Police for their alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a ninth-grade girl.

The incident unfolded when the girl's mother, a resident of Tahirpur, reported on Wednesday that her 14-year-old daughter had left for her tuition class at Janta Colony but failed to return. The situation escalated as the girl's mobile phone remained switched off, and despite intensive searches by her family in the vicinity of the tuition center and nearby locales, she could not be located.
Later that night, the family received a ransom call from their daughter's phone number, with an unidentified individual demanding the sum of Rs 50 lakh. Threats were issued, indicating harm to the girl if the payment was not made, as relayed by a police officer.

This led to the identification and subsequent arrest of one of the suspects, Ravi Kumar, who was apprehended near Kashmere Gate while attempting to board a train bound for Bihar. 
Shahdara deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Rohit Meena confirmed this development.
Interrogation of Ravi revealed that he was involved in share market trading and had hatched the plan in collaboration with his accomplice, Akash, as a means to acquire quick money. 
The victim had initially connected with Ravi via Instagram, where he deliberately allured her with the prospect of pursuing fashion designing in Nepal. Upon gaining control over the girl's whereabouts, they proceeded to demand the ransom from her family.
The police successfully rescued the girl from Behta in Loni, Uttar Pradesh, and subsequently arrested Akash. Two mobile phones linked to the suspects, which were used for planning and executing the kidnapping, as well as the victim's phone employed for ransom demands, were recovered in the process, confirmed the DCP.
