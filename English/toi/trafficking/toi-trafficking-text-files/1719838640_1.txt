NEW DELHI: WWE founder Vince McMahon is facing serious allegations of sex trafficking and assault in a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Janel Grant. The lawsuit, filed in a Connecticut federal court on Thursday, accuses McMahon of pressuring Grant into a sexual relationship as a condition of her employment, leading to a series of disturbing incidents.
Grant claims that she was hired by McMahon in 2019 when she was facing unemployment and the loss of her parents.Top Picks For YouLogan Paul grills John Cena on cryptic Instagram postsâ€‹John Cena drops revelations on Logan Paul's IMPAULSIVE podcast: 3 key talking pointsHowever, what initially seemed like an opportunity turned into a nightmare, according to the lawsuit.

The allegations assert that McMahon coerced Grant into a sexual relationship in exchange for her job. The lawsuit describes McMahon greeting her inappropriately, sharing explicit details about his personal life, and pressuring her for physical contact. Once employed, McMahon allegedly distributed explicit photos of Grant to other WWE employees and wrestlers, creating a toxic work environment.

The accusations escalate further, with Grant alleging that McMahon and another WWE executive sexually assaulted her while colleagues were occupied at their desks. Following this traumatic incident, McMahon allegedly compelled Grant to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) by claiming that his wife had discovered their relationship.
Grant succumbed to this pressure and signed the NDA, reportedly in exchange for payments that McMahon later ceased to provide, as per the lawsuit. The severity of these accusations has cast a dark shadow over McMahon's legacy and the WWE.
