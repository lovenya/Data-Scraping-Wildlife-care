NEW DELHI: Magician David Copperfield has come under scrutiny as more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual misconduct spanning several decades, as reported by The Guardian on Wednesday.
According to an investigation done by The Guardian, allegations from 16 women have been uncovered, some of whom claim they were under 18 at the time of the incidents.Disturbingly, three women allege that Copperfield drugged them before engaging in sexual acts.
The report, based on interviews with over 100 individuals and scrutiny of police and court records, details encounters dating from the late 1980s to 2014, with the women meeting Copperfield through his professional engagements over his extensive career.
Copperfield's legal team refuted the accusations, asserting that he had "never acted inappropriately with anyone, let alone anyone underage."
Notably, this isn't the first time Copperfield has faced such allegations. In 2018, Brittney Lewis accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her three decades prior, which he vehemently denied. Lewis is one of the women included in The Guardian's expos√©.
Furthermore, another woman, preferring anonymity, alleged that Copperfield had drugged her and a friend before engaging in sexual activity with them. Copperfield's lawyers denied these claims as well, highlighting the absence of complaints when the alleged assaults occurred.
One woman, identified under a pseudonym, claimed to have been groomed by Copperfield since she was 15, alleging late-night calls and gifts. Their relationship, which she says began consensually when she turned 18, lasted four years. Copperfield's legal team stated that their relationship was legal and consensual, vehemently denying any suggestions of grooming or impropriety.
Copperfield's association with convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein has also garnered attention. While Copperfield's name appeared in unsealed court documents related to Epstein, his lawyers asserted that he was unaware of Epstein's crimes until they were publicized. "Our client did not know about Epstein's horrific crimes," the Guardian cited Copperfield's lawyers as saying. "Like the rest of the world, he learned about it from the press."
