Mumbai: Observing that lately there has been a rise in human trafficking cases, especially of minor children, Bombay high court recently held a man guilty of seeking to traffic his 14-year-old neighbour by taking her to a Nashik red light area on the pretext of buying her clothes and said he “deserves no sympathy”. 
HC set aside his 2013 acquittal by a Nashik trial court and sentenced him to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment, reports Swati Deshpande.
The single-judge HC bench, in the January 15 judgment, held: “In order to curb such social evil, some deterrence is required.”
State had filed an appeal in 2015 taking exception to the Dec 2013 acquittal of the accused in the Feb 2013 case. The trial court had found no evidence against him for the offence of kidnapping and under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act.
The HC held that the lower court had not appreciated the evidence properly and wrongly acquitted the man whose defence was that he had taken the child to Nashik with her brother’s permission.
