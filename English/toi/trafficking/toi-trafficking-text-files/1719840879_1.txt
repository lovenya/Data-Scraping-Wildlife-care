HYDERABAD: Childless couple who had bought infants from human-traffickers were on Tuesday forced to hand over their bundles of joy back to police officials. Many of them broke down at the Rachakonda commissionerate in Neredmet, saying they had become extremely attached to infants. They pleaded with the officers to let them keep the children.

"We have been married for close to a decade.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoWe had everything in our lives, but not a child. This girl came into our lives as hope for our future. Now everything is gone," said a woman who had bought a two-and-a-half-year-old from traffickers. The couple from Banjara Hills got the child when she was three days old.
In another case, a woman from Suryapet was seen pleading with the officers to let her keep the one-and-half-year-old boy. The woman told the officers that she had already lost her husband and did not want to lose the boy. "First, I did not have a child. I got one with great difficulty. Even before that feeling of being a mother could sink in, I lost my husband. Now, I am losing my child as well. I do not have any purpose in life," said the woman.
