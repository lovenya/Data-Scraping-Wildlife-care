PARIS: At least twenty-five Indian passengers who had stayed behind seeking asylum in France after their flight from the UAE was grounded last week over suspicion of human trafficking before being allowed to take off for India have now been freed, according to local French media reports on Wednesday. 
The flight, carrying 276 mostly Indian passengers, took off for Mumbai on Monday afternoon after four days of being held at Châlons-Vatry airport near Paris.Top Picks For YouCharter flight with 276 Indians, suspected 'human trafficking victims' land in Mumbai, passengers interrogatedPlane held in France over 'human trafficking' concerns lands in MumbaiCharter flight, grounded in France over `human trafficking' suspicion leaves for Mumbai with about 280 Indians onboard, tech halt at Fujairah

The ‘Le Monde’ newspaper quoted prosecutors to say that the local judge had ordered their release on “formal grounds”, considering that the head of the border police at France’s main Charles De Gaulle airport “had not referred the case to him” within the timeframe stipulated by law. “They are therefore free to do as they please, even if they are in an irregular situation on French territory,” the Bobigny public prosecutor’s office told the French newspaper.
Among the 25 passengers, five were taken into care of child welfare services for being minors. The 25 people were among 303 passengers who boarded a plane operated by Romanian company Legend Airlines in Dubai last week. They were bound for Nicaragua but a refueling stopover at Vatry airport in northeastern France on December 21 resulted in the plane being grounded for four days after an anonymous tipoff.
