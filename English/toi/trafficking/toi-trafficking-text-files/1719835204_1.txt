Nagpur: The controversial Besa torture case, in which a 10-year-old girl was sexually and physically abused by her employers for four years at a rented house at Atharva Nagari, has now been handed over to assistant police inspector Rekha Sankhpal, in-charge of the anti-human trafficking unit, by CP Amitesh Kumar on Tuesday.
The case’s first investigation officer of Hudkeshwar police station sub-inspector Balu Rathod was suspended for shoddy probe and also extending undue favours to accused Tah Armaan Khan and Azhar Shaikh.
