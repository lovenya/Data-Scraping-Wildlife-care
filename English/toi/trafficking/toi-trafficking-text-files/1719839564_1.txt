NEW DELHI: Former WWE chairman Vince McMahon has made a substantial move by selling a sizable chunk of his stock in the organization in the midst of an ongoing sex trafficking lawsuit and his recent resignation as executive chairman of TKO, according to recent SEC filings.
As reported by TMZ, McMahon sold 5,350,000 shares, accounting for nearly 25 percent of his stock in TKO, for a total value of $411.95 million.Top Picks For You​Rhea Ripley sends message to Dominik Mysterio after WWE RAW defeat​Monday Night RAW makes headline ahead of WrestleMania XLThe shares could potentially be worth as much as $436 million after TKO's stock closed at $81.67 on Monday. This marks the second significant stock sale for the 78-year-old mogul, as he previously sold 8,400,000 shares in November, netting $700 million.


McMahon, however, is holding on to a remaining stake in TKO, amounting to approximately 15 million shares. This recent move follows his departure from the company after a lawsuit was filed by former WWE staffer Janel Grant, accusing McMahon of sexual abuse and trafficking within the organization.

The lawsuit alleges that Grant signed a nondisclosure agreement in 2022, agreeing to silence in exchange for $3 million. However, she claims that payments ceased after the initial $1 million, leading her to seek to void the agreement and seek unspecified damages.
In response to the allegations, McMahon vehemently denied their validity, describing the lawsuit as "replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth." Since his resignation, McMahon has remained out of the public eye, expressing his intention to fight the lawsuit and clear his name.
