NEW DELHI: Teaching minors about "good touch' and "bad touch' is not enough in today's virtual world and children must be educated on the emerging concept of "virtual touch' and its potential dangers, the Delhi High Court has said. This includes educating children on proper online conduct, identifying signs of predatory behavior, and grasping the significance of privacy settings and online limits.
"This court is constrained to note that in today's virtual modern world where virtual space has also become a breeding ground of alleged virtual affections between teenagers, they are not equipped to deal with the potential dangers of human trafficking for prostitution and other side of crimes which exists in the virtual world," Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma said on Monday.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
The high court made observations when it rejected a bail request from Kamlesh Devi, who was accused of aiding her son in sexually assaulting a minor girl by kidnapping her and forcing her into prostitution.
Rajiv allegedly kidnapped the 16-year-old girl after befriending her on social media and luring her to meet him. She was transported to Madhya Pradesh and kept captive there for multiple days. The man and others reportedly sexually assaulted her.

The teenager claimed that the accused individuals would bring different men to the location where she was kept against her will and she was compelled to expose herself to these men for sexual pleasure.
"Traditionally, efforts to protect minors from harm have focused on teaching them about "good touch' and "bad touch' in the physical realm. Nevertheless, in the modern digital world, it is important to expand this education to include the idea of 'virtual touch'. Minors must be equipped with the knowledge and tools to navigate online interactions safely and recognise potential risks lurking in cyberspace," the court said.
It mentioned that similar to teaching children to be cautious in the real world, there should be initiatives to educate them on building critical thinking abilities to evaluate the trustworthiness of online connections and protect their personal data.
"Moreover, parents, guardians and educators play a crucial role in fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online conduct among minors. Adults can empower children to make informed decisions and protect themselves from online threats by fostering open communication channels and providing guidance on navigating the digital landscape.
It mentioned that it is also important to communicate a message through this order to stakeholders like schools, colleges, Delhi State Legal Services Authority, and Delhi Judicial Academy to organize programs, workshops, and conferences on the subject.
