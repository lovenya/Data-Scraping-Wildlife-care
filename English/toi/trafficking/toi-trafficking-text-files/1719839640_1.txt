NEW DELHI: A former member of the DMK party, Jaffer Sadiq, was arrested on Saturday in connection with an international drugs trafficking investigation case estimated to be worth more than Rs 2,000 crore, The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) announced. 
The NCB has labeled Sadiq as the "mastermind and kingpin" of a network involved in illegal drug activities spanning India, Australia, and New Zealand.Sadiq, who is known for producing Tamil films, was recently expelled from the ruling DMK party after being linked to the drugs network by the agency. He held the position of Chennai West deputy organiser in the DMK's NRI wing.
The opposition BJP and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu have been criticising the DMK over this issue.
 Last month, the NCB arrested three individuals from Tamil Nadu and seized 50 kg of pseudoephedrine, a chemical used in narcotics production, during a raid in Delhi. The NCB and the special cell of the Delhi Police conducted the search based on a tip-off received from Australian and New Zealand authorities in late 2023. 
The authorities had informed them about large quantities of pseudoephedrine being smuggled into their countries from India, concealed in desiccated coconut powder and mix food powder. The US DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) also provided information indicating that the source of these consignments was in Delhi, according to the NCB statement. The three arrested individuals admitted to sending a total of 45 pseudoephedrine consignments over the past three years, amounting to about 3,500 kg and valued at over Rs 2,000 crore in the international market, as per the NCB.
The NCB had been searching for Sadiq to determine the source of the pseudoephedrine and had recently conducted raids at his premises in Chennai. AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami claimed on Friday that Tamil Nadu has become a hub of drug activity under DMK rule. He demanded an explanation from Chief Minister M K Stalin regarding how Jaffer Sadiq managed to establish ties with a senior police officer. 
Expressing his disappointment, Palaniswami said, "Jaffer Sadiq became close to the DMK leadership and even obtained a gift from a DGP. This is very unfortunate and anguishing and needs to be condemned." 
Pseudoephedrine is a highly addictive synthetic drug, and although it has legal uses, it is classified as a controlled substance in India, subject to strict regulations regarding production, possession, trade, export, and use. Possession and trade of pseudoephedrine without authorization can result in up to 10 years of imprisonment under the NDPS Act.
