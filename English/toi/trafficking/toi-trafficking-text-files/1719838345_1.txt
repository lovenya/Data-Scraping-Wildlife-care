Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, infamously known as the 'Lolita Express' and once used to transport VIP associates globally, is slated to be torn apart and scrapped, according to a DailyMail.com report.
The end of the 'Lolita Express'
The notorious Boeing 727, which has not been airborne since 2016, is currently accruing thousands in storage fees while parked beside a Georgia runway.PollDo you think Joe Biden will drop out of the US presidential race?YesNoPurchased by Florida-based World Aviation Services in March 2020, the plane was initially intended for profit or parts for a similar cargo aircraft. However, upon learning of its central role in Epstein's sex trafficking empire, the company's owner decided to dismantle it for parts, abandoning any hopes of finding a buyer.
Aircraft's infamous history
Epstein's private jet, which once ferried prominent figures like Bill Clinton, Britain's Prince Andrew, and actor Kevin Spacey, according to flight logs, has not received any offers in four years. The current owner, who requested anonymity, expressed dismay upon discovering the plane's notorious past and its connection to Epstein's criminal activities.
Creepy reminders of the past
The jet's interior, now corroded and infested with mold and mildew, features a garish red couch, mirrored walls, and monogrammed tissues, among other eerie reminders of its former owner. The plane has been unregistered since 2019 and cannot be legally flown, with its engines already stripped and sold.
Epstein's Jet in legal proceedings
Federal prosecutors have said that Epstein used the jet to shuttle young sex trafficking victims between his properties. The plane is still listed under Delaware-based JEGE Inc in federal aviation records, a company linked to Epstein and named in several lawsuits.
Final flight and current status
As per the Daily Mail report, the 'Lolita Express' took its last flight on July 11, 2016, from Palm Beach International Airport to Georgia's Brunswick Golden Isles Airport. Since then, it has been stationed near a maintenance hangar, incurring about $1,000 a month in storage fees.
Settlements and ongoing legal cases
Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre has settled cases with Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz, admitting she might have mistakenly accused the latter. The release of previously sealed documents in the Maxwell lawsuit has further unmasked many of Epstein's prominent associates.
Unwanted attention to rich and famous 
Recently released court records have reignited public interest in the high-profile individuals who associated with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. While some have expressed remorse for their associations with Epstein, others find themselves entangled in a web of conspiracy theories. 
Before his exposure as a pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein frequently socialized with the world's elite, hosting politicians, academics, and celebrities on his private island and luxury homes. Among his acquaintances were prominent philanthropists, princes, and supermodels. His girlfriend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, was often by his side during these gatherings. 
Following Epstein's suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, several individuals who had associated with him publicly apologized, asserting their unawareness of his habitual abuse of underage girls. However, the recent release of court records has once again sparked curiosity about the influential figures who were connected to Epstein and Maxwell.
