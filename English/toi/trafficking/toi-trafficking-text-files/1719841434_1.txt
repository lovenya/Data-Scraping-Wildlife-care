This marked a concerted global effort to address the growing concerns over drug abuse and illicit trafficking. 
The date of June 26th was chosen to commemorate the signing of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961. This international treaty aimed to combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking by coordinating efforts across nations. 
Over the years, the day has garnered widespread international participation from governments, organizations, and communities worldwide.
Significance
Drug abuse has become a global problem that requires a comprehensive multi-nation approach to deal with. According to the executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), around 64 million people worldwide suffer from drug use disorders, while hundreds of thousands lose their lives to drug use every year and roughly 14 million people around the world inject drugs, leaving them far more likely to contract HIV and Hepatitis C. 
Not only does this problem affect people at an individual level, but its community-level impact can also be where it leads to illegal drug peddling and organized crime in society. Therefore, it is essential to embrace a scientific evidence-based approach that prioritizes prevention and treatment.
2024's theme: "The evidence is clear: Invest in prevention"
This year's theme has been kept as “The evidence is clear: Invest in prevention”. Selection of this theme highlights the importance of effective drug policies which must based on science, research, compassion, full respect for human rights and a deep understanding of the social, economic, and health repercussions of drug use.
This year’s World Drug Day is a call to:
1. Increase Awareness and Understanding: Promote awareness of evidence-based prevention strategies' effectiveness and cost-efficiency in mitigating drug-related harms.
2. Advocate for Increased Investment: Encourage governments, policymakers, and law enforcement to invest more in prevention efforts, emphasizing the long-term benefits of early intervention.
3. Empower Communities with Tools and Resources: Provide communities with the necessary tools and resources to implement evidence-based prevention initiatives, fostering resilience and community-led solutions against drug use.
4. Facilitate Dialogue and Collaboration: Promote dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders to enhance evidence-based prevention practices and policies, fostering an environment for knowledge sharing and innovation.
5. Promote Evidence-based Policymaking: Advocate for evidence-based policymaking at national and international levels, ensuring drug policies are grounded in scientific research and informed by best practices to effectively combat drug trafficking and organized crime globally.
World Drug Report 2023
UNODC releases a world drug report every year which is based on a scientific approach and research. It contains factual data along with key statistics collected from official sources. 
This year's report has been released on 26th June 2024. According to the report, the new data put the global estimate of people who inject drugs in 2021 at 13.2 million, 18 percent higher than previously estimated. Globally, over 296 million people used drugs in 2021, an increase of 23 percent over the previous decade. The number of people who suffer from drug use disorders, meanwhile, has skyrocketed to 39.5 million, a 45 percent increase over 10 years.
The World drug report 2023 underscored the profound impact of social and economic inequalities on drug issues, which both fuel and are exacerbated by these challenges. It also sheds light on the environmental destruction and human rights violations caused by illicit drug economies, as well as the increasing prominence of synthetic drugs.
The report revealed a significant gap in meeting the demand for the treatment of drug-related disorders. In 2021, only one out of every five individuals with drug-related disorders received treatment, highlighting widening disparities in treatment access across different regions.
Youth populations are particularly vulnerable to drug use and experience more severe consequences of substance use disorders in various parts of the world. In Africa, for instance, 70 percent of individuals in treatment are under the age of 35, underscoring the disproportionate impact on younger demographics.
Here are the key takeaways from the report:-
New estimates of people who inject drugs are higher than previously estimated as treatment services and other interventions fall short, including for record numbers of displaced people due to humanitarian crises.“Cheap and easy” synthetics are changing drug markets with lethal results.Drug trafficking is accelerating environmental devastation and crime in the Amazon Basin.More monitoring of public health impacts is needed amid rapid regulatory changes and clinical trials with psychedelics.
