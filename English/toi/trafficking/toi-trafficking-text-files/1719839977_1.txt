KOLHAPUR: Rupali Chakankar, chairperson of Maharashtra State Commission for Women, on Friday said that cases of trafficking of women and girls have increased post-Covid, and the commission has traced nearly 1,750 of them so far.
She said some of them have already been brought back to India, and rest are in the process of being brought back. Speaking in Kolhapur, Chakankar said that during Covid, many girls and young women lost their fathers and brothers who were the backbone of the family.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo"The agents working in human trafficking took undue advantage the situation and trafficked young women and girls to the countries such as Dubai, Muscat and Oman. Last year, we brought back 27 girls. We have a list of 1,750 such women and girls who have been trafficked," said Chakankar.
Recently, girls under the influence of the drugs were videotaped by a Marathi actor in Pune. Chakankar said that precaution is needed to ensure that the identity of the girls is not revealed. Chakankar said that she has come across nine cases of fathers sexually assaulting daughters. "The bond between the relations is tearing apart due to various reasons. Hearing on four of these cases is on," she added.
