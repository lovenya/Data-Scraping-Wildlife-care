AGARTALA: Tripura Police on Tuesday arrested five youths from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar who appeared for an interview at BSF Tripura Frontier headquarters with a permanent resident certificate (PRC) of the state.

The youth and students’ wings of opposition CPM, Congress and Tipra Motha on Tuesday warned that they would launch a massive protest seeking action against the government officers who were involved in issuing fake certificates to the outsiders. Besides opposition parties, the ruling BJP MLAs have been threatening to launch a crackdown ever since locals detained an outsider job aspirant from the capital complex area with false PRC of Tripura.
The locals complained that everyday a large number of unemployed youths from outside the state attend the interview for the post of central security forces through Staff Selection Commission (SSC) under a reserved quota for Tripura.

“A specific FIR had been lodged last week based on which another youth from Bihar, who was also carrying a Tripura PRC, was arrested during the interview at Gokulnagar BSF campus here,” Deb pointed out, adding that an alert has been issued across the state against the holders of such documents.
