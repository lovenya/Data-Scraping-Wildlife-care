GURUGRAM: To prevent people from falling into the traps of immigration agents and to stay alert against education, travel, and employment scams, the Gurugram Police on Friday issued an advisory urging people to thoroughly check such agents before approaching them.
The police also warned of strict legal action against agents/agencies sending people abroad for work, travel, and education without being registered with the government.PollShould NEET UG 2024 be reconducted following recent irregularities?NoYes
The advisory followed the recent arrest of a city-based social media influencer named Balwant Kataria alias Bobby Kataria for alleged human trafficking and cheating 33 persons.
"Due to a lack of awareness, people often fall prey to fake travel agents and lose lakhs of rupees. People need to be cautious of such fake travel agents. Before getting a visa to go abroad, get complete information about the agent and take services only from government-recognised agents," said Varun Dahiya, ACP (crime).
