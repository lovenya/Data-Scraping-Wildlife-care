GUWAHATI: Arunachal Pradesh Police have busted an inter-state sex trafficking and prostitution ring involving minor girls in Itanagar, and rescued five girls aged between 10 and 15. In raids spanning 10 days, cops have arrested 21 persons, including traffickers, pimps and customers. Among the customers arrested were eight govt employees.
All the girls were from poor families in Dhemaji and Udalguri in Assam, who were trafficked to Itanagar between 2020 and 2023 on the pretext of giving them a better life and were pushed into prostitution, police said.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
One of them was only eight years old when she was brought to Itanagar in 2020. "She managed to escape, but was brought back in 2022," Itanagar (Capital) SP Rohit Rajbir Singh said.
More disturbing is the fact that initial medical reports indicate three of the girls have a high viral load, which suggests the presence of sexually transmitted diseases.
