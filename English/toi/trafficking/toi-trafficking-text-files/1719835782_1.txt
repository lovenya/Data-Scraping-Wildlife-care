BAREILLY: Six members of a child trafficking gang, including four women, were arrested in Moradabad on Friday. The gang had recently bought a newborn from its grandmother for Rs 30,000, with plans to sell the infant to a childless couple in Delhi for Rs 3 lakh.
Moradabad SSP Hemraj Meena said, "The gang targeted poor couples and pregnant women, enticing them with financial assistance to sell their children, and subsequently selling them to childless couples in metro cities at high prices."
Investigation began when a couple in Moradabad's Bilari area reported the disappearance of their 7-day-old daughter.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNoThe newborn was handed over to one Geeta Rani, who was part of a human trafficking gang and she then gave the baby to her associates in Moradabad city."
Upon questioning, Geeta disclosed the identities of her gang members -- Shabnam Younus, Neetu Devi, Shazia, Mohammed Younus, and Gaurav Kumar -- all residents of Moradabad city. 
SSP Meena said, "This gang has sold six children across Agra, Delhi and Kolkata till date. A team has been dispatched to Mumbai to arrest their leader Deepmala. An FIR has been registered under relevant sections of the IPC."
