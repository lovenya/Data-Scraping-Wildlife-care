In a society grappling with numerous ethical and social challenges, the grim issue of organ trafficking continues to be a horrifyingly stubborn scourge. It's a pervasive issue that tears families apart, exploits vulnerable populations, and operates in the shadows of legality. Addressing this unspeakable tragedy, filmmaker Sarmistha Deb has come up with her thought-provoking movie, ‘Mastermind’, which aims to cast a spotlight on the terrifying world of organ trading and kidnapping. 
 The film stars Saurav Das and Darshana Banik in the lead. While Saurav portrays Surya, a police officer determined to unravel the intricacies of the illegal organ trade, Darshana will be seen as Jhilik, a science teacher who becomes emotionally involved with Surya. The cast also includes Subhrajit Dutta, Rumki Chatterjee, Arkaprava Bhattacharya, and Lucky Bapuli, making it a robust portrayal of different facets of society. Adding a youthful dynamism to the film are two teenage detectives, essayed by newcomers Eklabya and Snigdha. Their characters bring a fresh perspective to the issue, symbolizing how even the younger generation is forced to confront this nightmarish reality. 
 The film, primarily a thriller, transcends mere genre to probe deep ethical and societal questions. One such question that looms large is whether love and relationships can endure in a world tainted by such malevolence. 
 Director Sarmistha Deb, whose previous film ‘Kadambari Ajo’ garnered international acclaim, has expressed her satisfaction with the performance and professionalism of her cast. She praised Saurav's humility and Darshana's dedicated approach towards their roles. 

 The movie, which is set to release shortly after the Durga Puja, promises to be a haunting narrative replete with emotional nuances and societal critiques. Adding to the atmospheric depth are soulful renditions by notable singers Rupam Islam, Rupankar Bagchi, and Ankita Bhattacharya. Yash Chakraborty, a US-based lyricist, contributed two songs, making the project a truly international endeavor. 
 The film has been shot primarily around Kolkata's outskirts, adding a layer of authenticity to the narrative.
