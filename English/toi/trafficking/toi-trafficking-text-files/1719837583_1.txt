They lured these individuals with false promises, including the prospect of obtaining legitimate documentation for emigration to Canada and securing employment," said the NIA.
NIA registered a case in 2021 after the Tamil Nadu Police's Q branch secured 23 Sri Lankan nationals and four agents in Madurai, which led to the detention of another 38 Sri Lankan nationals in Mangaluru. 
So far, the NIA has arrested 13 suspects in the case and filed a chargesheet against five named Dhinakaran alias Ayya, Kasi Viswanathan, Rasool, Satham Ushen, and Abdul Muheetu.
"Investigations revealed that Imran Khan played a pivotal role in a broader conspiracy involving international human trafficking. He acted as the main conduit responsible for transporting Sri Lankan nationals from their home country to India and subsequently to other nations," said the NIA.
