Bhubaneswar: A city-based social outfit organised a workshop here on Friday on ways to counter human trafficking where several survivors narrated how they were regularly subjected to mental and physical torture by their employers.
“I was taken to Maharashtra for work just after I delivered my baby (a boy) in 2013. My son, husband and I used to survive on a meagre salary of Rs 150 a week for lifting 300 bricks a day.When my husband fell sick, our employers did not even provide proper treatment,” said Santoshini of Balangir district, adding their employers would regularly beat them up.
Kalahandi-based Diyalu Niyal had his hand and leg severed while working in Vizag. “Twelve of us were being taken to Vizag but mid-way, they only took two of us and while we were there, they would beat us up every day,” Niyal said.
ADGP CID (crime branch Odisha), Arun Bothra, who participated in the workshop organised by Odisha Women in Media, said, “Human trafficking is a complex problem and we need to deal with it meticulously. We need inputs from the civil societies and from those working at the ground-level so that we could take prompt action to stop this practice.”
