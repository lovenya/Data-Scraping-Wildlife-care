KOLKATA: A 20-year-old woman — trafficked from Bangladesh’s Chittagong to New Delhi and later rescued — has helped uncover the operations of an international human trafficking racket. 
The Haryana Police (HP) has arrested two persons in this connection on Tuesday following court orders. An HP team is likely to visit Bengal. The trafficking ring has operations in Bangladesh, West Bengal’s Nadia and Kolkata, and in New Delhi.
After she was rescued, the woman reportedly married a man from Haryana’s Ballabgarh who was allegedly her client.The duo met at Badarpur (Delhi-Haryana border) after setting up a fake meeting and fled from the spot. The couple then sought protection from the Palwal Court when the racket was exposed. The court intervened and asked the police to probe. Shakti Vahini, an NGO, is helping the couple fight their case.
According to the FIR, the Chittagong resident was trafficked by her neighbour, Nargis, with the promise of a job in New Delhi. She was taken to Jessore on January 28 and was made to cross the border illegally by two persons Ammo — Nargis’s mother — and Raju. She was given a fake ID and a phone with an Indian SIM. A man, Jugnu, put her on a train to Kolkata. The woman was then taken to New Delhi’s Ali Gaon and forced into prostitution by two persons, Lata and her husband Asghar. The duo had initially demanded Rs 1.2lakh from the woman.
