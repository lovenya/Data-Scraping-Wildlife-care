VIJAYAWADA: The opposition TDP has cast doubts on the explanation provided by Sandhya Aqua Company in response to allegations of importing narcotics disguised as dried yeast. Sandhya Aqua has defended itself by claiming ignorance of any narcotics in the consignment received from Brazil. They stated that the contents of the container had been cleared by the Ministry of Agriculture in Brazil on January 17.PollDo you think opposition's demand for SC-appointed probe into allegations of irregularities in NEET-UG 2024 exams justified?YesNo
However, the TDP has raised concerns over the timing of the clearance granted by the Brazilian Agriculture Ministry, as records show that the container departed from Santos port in Brazil on January 14.
Kommareddy Pattabhiram, the official spokesperson of TDP, pointed to container tracking data from Ocean Network Express (ONE) to support their argument. According to the data, the container was loaded onto the 'Navios Domino 010N' vessel on January 14 at 15:31 hours, and the vessel left Santos port on the same day at 19:35 hours. This discrepancy raises questions about how the Brazilian Agriculture Ministry could issue a clearance certificate for the container's contents on January 17, as claimed by Sandhya Aqua.
Pattabhiram alleged that the company's management is involved in illegal drug trafficking and has close ties with the ruling party. He cited the incident where local police intervened at Visakhapatnam port, causing delays in the CBI's investigation. This action, according to Pattabhiram, indicates an attempt to cover up the issue, similar to the handling of the Y S Vivekananda Reddy murder case involving Y S Avinash Reddy.

Instead of informing the CBI, who were conducting searches at the company's premises, the police reportedly alerted the company representatives and returned the bus to them. This failure to cooperate with the investigation raises suspicions about the involvement of YSRC officials in illegal drug activities and paints a grim picture of Visakhapatnam as a hub for drug trafficking in India.
The sequence of events, as outlined by the TDP spokesperson, points towards a larger issue of collusion between the company, ruling party members, and law enforcement authorities, highlighting the need for a thorough and unbiased investigation into the matter.
