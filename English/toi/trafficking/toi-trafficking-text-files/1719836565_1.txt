NEW DELHI: A group of nearly 40 Filipino labourers involved in the construction of stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has filed a lawsuit against U.S. construction company Jacobs Solutions Inc.
In their complaint, lodged in a federal court in Denver, Colorado, the workers allege that Jacobs and its various subsidiaries overseeing the projects exposed them to hazardous and inhumane conditions.PollHas Virat Kohli taken the right decision to announce retirement from T20Is?YesNo
The plaintiffs assert that these conditions included being compelled to reside in cramped, unsanitary dormitories and working gruelling 72-hour shifts under extreme heat without access to food and water. They also claim that they were not paid their full wages and had their passports confiscated, which prevented them from seeking alternative employment or returning to the Philippines.
Jacobs, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, has yet to respond to the lawsuit.

The treatment of migrant labourers, including Filipinos, in Qatar has been the subject of significant scrutiny and criticism by human rights organizations. Leading up to the 2022 World Cup, reports emerged of hundreds of workers who had lost their lives, with thousands more injured during the construction process.
The Qatari government has countered these reports, asserting that the number of fatalities and injuries was significantly lower than what was reported. In 2020, they increased the minimum wage and extended its coverage to foreign workers for the first time.
The workers bringing this suit claim that Jacobs was aware or should have been aware of the human rights violations in Qatar and knowingly took advantage of the labourers. They have accused Jacobs and its subsidiaries of violating U.S. laws prohibiting human trafficking or forced labour, even when such conduct occurs beyond the nation's borders. The plaintiffs are also pursuing claims of negligence and unjust enrichment, with damages to be determined.
