NEW DELHI: The pro wrestling world is grappling with one of its most significant controversies in the wake of the shocking sex trafficking allegations against Vince McMahon. McMahon recently resigned from his position at TKO Holdings, WWE's parent company. Amidst the controversy, Paul "Triple H" Levesque, McMahon's son-in-law and WWE Chief Content Officer, faced criticism for his handling of the situation.Top Picks For YouKansas City Chiefs triumph in AFC Championship: 3 key talking pointsJannik Sinner: Pope Francis congratulates the Italian on historic Australian Open victory
Dave Meltzer, a well-known wrestling journalist, expressed his disappointment with Triple H's response in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter). Meltzer, while acknowledging his personal fondness for Levesque, criticized what he perceived as a poor handling of the situation, given the gravity of the accusations against McMahon.

"Your father-in-law was just accused of sex trafficking and rape. Everyone knows how much I personally like Paul, but this was bad. The most powerful man in the history of the business was just removed in disgrace. This was really bad," Meltzer's tweet read.
Online discussions mirrored Meltzer's sentiments, with some fans expressing disappointment in Triple H's perceived lack of a more intense reaction or a statement regarding the allegations. However, others defended Levesque, speculating that he might be legally restricted from commenting on the matter.

The fallout from McMahon's resignation has reportedly surprised many within WWE, particularly with the swift response from sponsors like Slim Jim, which threatened to withdraw sponsorship ahead of the WWE Royal Rumble 2024 event. There are also rumors circulating within the promotion that Endeavor, the parent company of TKO, might consider removing individuals close to McMahon from the boardroom. Those who returned alongside McMahon after his initial retirement are believed to be vulnerable if Endeavor takes this route.
In an unusual move, WWE has removed Vince McMahon's profile from its official website in response to the allegations. This drastic step has been rarely taken in the past, notable instances being the controversies surrounding Hulk Hogan's racist rant, the revelation of details behind Chris Benoit's double-murder and suicide, and after Jimmy Snuka's trial for murder in 2016.
