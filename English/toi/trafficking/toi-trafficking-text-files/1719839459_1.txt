Vince McMahon had initially stepped down from his position as CEO and head of creative at WWE in 2022 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, he later returned to the company for a brief period to facilitate its sale to Endeavor Group. Following the sale, McMahon took a position on the TKO board. The recent lawsuit from Janel Grant has now prompted McMahon to resign from both World Wrestling Entertainment and the TKO Group.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, which accompanied the company's yearly business report, detailed the leadership changes at TKO Group. According to the filing, "On February 22, 2024, following Vincent McMahon's resignation from the position of Executive Chair of the Board in January 2024, the Board appointed Ariel Emanuel, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, the independent directors of the Board established the position of Lead Independent Director and appointed Steven R. Koonin to serve in such role. Both appointments became effective as of February 22, 2024."
Ari Emanuel, known for his role as the CEO of Endeavor Group, brings a wealth of experience to his new position as Executive Chair of the TKO Board. Meanwhile, Steve Koonin, with his distinguished background, assumes the crucial role of Lead Independent Director.
