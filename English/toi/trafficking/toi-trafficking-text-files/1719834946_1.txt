Jhala said that the other two children included a boy who was kidnapped from Jodhpur in Rajasthan four years ago when he was one year old. The third child was the girl whose features were like that of a child from the northeast or Nepal. She was kidnapped from Delhi when she was about two months old.

The couple used to survive on begging and kept moving from one place to the other. “The social welfare department in Ratlam had taken custody of the boy kidnapped from Jodhpur, but the couple managed to furnish documents for the child and took his custody,” said Jhala. 
Cops now try to verify the documents of the children.
