Panaji: State govt has granted below the poverty line (BPL) ration cards to 10 survivors of human trafficking after they alleged they were cheated by some people who had promised ration cards to them. The survivors said they are now relieved because they will no longer have to struggle to get food.
Arz, an NGO, with the assistance of the Goa State Legal Services Authority and the civil supplies department has managed to get the ration cards issued for the survivors residing in Mormugao taluka.
A survivor said she had requested many people to help her acquire a ration card, but only encountered disappointment. “One person defrauded me and I faced many problems,” she said. “I am so happy that I have finally got the ration card.” 
Another survivor said, “I am very pleased that I have received this ration card, which includes my son’s name. The earlier one was a yellow card which entitled us to only 8kg of rice per month. We were trying to get the red ration card, but never received that.”

This is a moment of great joy as the hard work of the legal services authority and Arz has borne fruit.”
Pandey said the issuance of the cards is a significant milestone in the fight against human trafficking. “We are sure that the cards will help the survivors and their families benefit from govt schemes of offering rations at subsidised rates,” he said.
