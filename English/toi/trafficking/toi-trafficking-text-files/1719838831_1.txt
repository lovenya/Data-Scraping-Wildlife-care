Initially anticipated to make a surprise return at the Royal Rumble, Lesnar's comeback was replaced by rising star Bron Breakker in the Men's Rumble Match. The original creative plan involved Lesnar's elimination by Dominik Mysterio, with subsequent matches against Mysterio at the Elimination Chamber and WWE Intercontinental Champion Gunther at WrestleMania 40.
However, in light of the legal controversies surrounding Vince McMahon and WWE, Lesnar has been removed from these creative plans. Fans were quick to notice his absence from the WWE 2K Supercard mobile game, adding another layer to the uncertainty surrounding Lesnar's future in WWE.

Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful confirmed the news on social media, stating, "Brock Lesnar has been removed from WWE's creative plans." This decision underscores the significant impact of the ongoing legal situation on Lesnar's involvement in WWE storylines.
As of now, there are no indications or plans to incorporate Brock Lesnar into WWE programming. The company seems to be taking a cautious approach, keeping Lesnar on the sidelines amidst the legal turbulence. The wrestling world waits to see how this situation unfolds and its potential implications on the career of the former champion.
