Udaan - Football for Her: The 'Anahat For Change Foundation,' a commendable NGO dedicated to social causes, is launching a groundbreaking initiative called "Udaan - Football for Her" in collaboration with MICRO (Mahalandi Institute of Child Rights Organization). The project aims to provide a platform and peer support group for young girls, particularly survivors of gender-based violence from underprivileged backgrounds, in the Kandi block of Murshidabad district.The primary goal is to combat child marriage, trafficking, and gender-based violence while empowering women and girls through knowledge, life skills, and capacity development.
Child marriage remains a pressing issue in India, with the United Nations report ranking the country second highest in this regard. The Murshidabad district in West Bengal has shown a high prevalence of child marriage, with alarming statistics indicating 55.4% of women aged 20-24 were married before the age of 18. Early marriage often leads to teenage pregnancy, with NFHS data reporting 20.6% teenage pregnancies in the district. Moreover, Murshidabad has been identified as one of the districts with the highest number of missing women and trafficking cases.
To support the young girls involved in "Udaan - Football for Her," the German Consul General in Kolkata, Mr. Manfred Auster, will generously donate sports equipment under Germany's "International sports promotion policy." The German Federal Foreign Office's promotion of sports policy is renowned for building bridges across linguistic, political, and cultural divides, and has been an essential part of its cultural relations and education activities abroad.
Speaking about the initiative, Consul-General Manfred Auster emphasized, "Women empowerment, their rights, and safety have always been our top priority. We are pleased to lend a helping hand to organizations working in this crucial field and hope to garner support in spreading awareness and bringing about positive change to safeguard human rights, especially in the fight against trafficking of girls and women."

This will present a unique opportunity for the press to interact with the players and partners involved.
The event will also feature the screening of the documentary film "Malaise of Mankind," which sheds light on the pressing issue of trafficking of women and girls. Funded by the German Consulate General in Kolkata, the film aims to raise awareness and contribute to the fight against trafficking.
As the 'Udaan - Football for Her' initiative takes flight, it symbolizes hope and empowerment for young girls who have faced adversity, as well as a strong call to action against child marriage, gender-based violence, and trafficking. Together, with the support of the German Consulate General and other partners, this noble endeavour seeks to create a more inclusive and secure environment for women and girls in Murshidabad and beyond.
