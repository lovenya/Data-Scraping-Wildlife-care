As part of a long-term commitment to endangered species and their habitats, the Duke of Cambridge has launched an initiative convening seven of the world’s most influential conservation organizations and the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Duke will be president of the collaboration, named “United for Wildlife,” as it tackles the universal challenges of conservation crises.

John Robinson, WCS’s Executive Vice President for Conservation and Science said about the collaboration: "The Wildlife Conservation Society is honored to be a part of United for Wildlife. This is an unprecedented collaboration between seven conservation organizations and the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. We realize that we need to raise the profile of nature conservation around the world, and specifically to inspire young people to address critical conservation issues. One issue that will be an early focus will be the illegal trafficking of wildlife products, specifically elephant ivory and rhino horn. By working together, we can do more than any one organization alone."

United for Wildlife is based on a 10-year vision for action and collaboration. The group’s leaders have a range of backgrounds: business, communications, technology, and creative industries. Together, they will work to find fast and effective ways to protect the world’s natural resources. As part of the ongoing commitment, United for Wildlife will also aim to engage the next generation of conversationalists by giving them the tools and platforms needed to make lasting changes.
