Africa’s Albertine Rift is well known for its mountain gorillas—less so for its shovel-nosed frog. But this amphibian and others are getting some much needed attention in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where WCS scientists have announced the discovery of 10 probable new species as part of a progress report. Conservationists are working hand-in-hand with local communities to protect the Albertine Rift's natural resources. The region’s forests support sustainable livelihoods for local communities and provide habitat for a wealth of wildlife, including several threatened amphibian species.
