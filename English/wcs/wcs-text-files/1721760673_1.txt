An incredible story of human-wildlife conflict emanating from India turned tragedy into triumph for one of the country’s beloved big cats. On December 4, community members from the southwestern village of Nidugumba discovered an adult tigress incapacitated by a barbed-wire fence. Already injured, the tiger could have suffered harassment, or done harm to herself—tigers typically struggle when threatened, which can cause injuries to escalate.   Fortunately, community members called for help, and rangers and veterinarians soon arrived to untangle the feline and get her to safety.    In response to these recovery efforts, Dr. Ullas Karanth, WCS Director for Science in Asia, praised the village of Nidugumba and the staff and officers of the Karnataka Forest Department for their exemplary efforts.
