						New York, NY - March 15, 2020 - The Wildlife Conservation Society is temporarily closing the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, Queens Zoo and New York Aquarium, effective Monday, March 16. Our five parks will be closed and education and public programs will be cancelled until further notice. This action is being taken as city and state leaders have called on businesses to voluntarily close to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19; and following declarations of states of emergency in the United States, New York State and New York City. We are committed to the safety of our staff, volunteers, guests and community. We will provide updates and information on when we will reopen the parks and resume normal operations. During this period when the parks are closed, essential animal care and operations staff will continue to provide care for our animals and make sure all essential life support and other vital systems continue to operate without disruption. For the past weeks, we have developed plans to ensure our animals will be well cared for in the event of a disruption to regular operations due to COVID-19. If anyone has previously purchased tickets for a zoo visit WCS will honor/accept them on any future date in 2020. WCS Members will automatically have their Membership extended. Visit our zoo and aquarium websites for further details. If anyone has specific concerns, please reach out to Member Services at membership@wcs.org or customer care team at guestrelations@wcs.org. ###
