Everyone is invited to enter and submit their best photographs of animals at any of the five WCS wildlife parks in New York City: Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, New York Aquarium, Prospect Park Zoo, and Queens Zoo.  The photos will be judged by WCS’s Photo Department on visual appeal, composition, and originality. The best of them will be judged by the public to determine the 12 winning shots that will appear in the calendar. The contest runs now through August 7. The winning photos will be announced later this summer and each will be the featured photo for a month in the 2017 WCS Wild View calendar.   Those whose photos are selected as one of the 12 winners to be featured in the calendar will receive a WCS Family Premium Membership and five copies of the printed 2017 calendar.    Photo submission instructions and contest rules can be found at http://bit.ly/29yoHNP.    From the year it opened its gates in 1899, the Bronx Zoo has had an official photographer. Elwin Roswell Sanborn was the first. He worked for much of the early 1900s capturing each species that came through the door in breathtaking black and white. Today, photographers from WCS Staff Photographer Julie Larsen Maher to the exceptional amateurs that make regular visits, remain a fixture at WCS wildlife parks. Their work furthers WCS’s mission by inspiring others to care about wildlife and wild places. For more information and to subscribe to WCS’s Wild View Photo Blog, visit http://blog.wcs.org/photo/.
