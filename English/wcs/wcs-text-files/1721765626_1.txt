						On Saturday, Dec. 14, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and officials from WCS’s Bronx Zoo will join Santa and Mrs. Claus at the Bronx Zoo to distribute toys to local Bronx military families in need this holiday season. This event is an annual tradition in the Bronx. The partnership between the Bronx Zoo and the Borough President is in its eleventh year. The Bronx Zoo serves as a collection point for new, unwrapped toys donated by members of the community for distribution to families of veterans and active duty members of the military. As a holiday treat for those in attendance, Santa and Mrs. Claus will be on hand for photo opportunities and to help give away the toys. Donations of new, unwrapped toys will continue to be accepted at all five of WCS’s wildlife parks in New York City through Dec. 31.
