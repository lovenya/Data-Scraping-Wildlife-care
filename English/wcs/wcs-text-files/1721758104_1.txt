This juvenile Galapagos tortoise lives in the World of Reptiles at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo. Along with five of its siblings that are also on exhibit, this tortoise is a direct offspring of the tortoises collected from the Galapagos Islands in the 1920s by Charles H. Townsend, a New York Zoological Society explorer. Townsend brought more than 100 tortoises from Isabela Island to the United States to initiate a breeding program for the survival of the species. 
 
 The largest living tortoise species, Galapagos tortoises can weigh more than 650 pounds and live more than 150 years. The parents of these six are more than 80 years old, still breeding, and considered relatively young.
