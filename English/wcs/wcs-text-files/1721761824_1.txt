 Bronx, NY – April 8, 2014 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo is inviting media to preview this summer’s newest attraction – Dinosaur Safari: Mysteries Revealed – on Saturday, April 12, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

 The exhibit will officially open to the public on the same day, but there will be two special tours for media with departures at 10:30 and 11:15 a.m.

 The narrated ride, powered by Chevrolet’s all-new and redesigned 2015 Suburban and 2015 Tahoe, will take adventurers through a two-acre area of the zoo past more than 30 fully-animatronic dinosaurs as they move, snarl, and roar.

Nine new dinosaur species have been added this year including the deinonychus, prodohadros, stegosaurus, and edmontonia. Returning for the Dinosaur Safari: Mysteries Revealed, the ever-popular 40-foot long tyrannosaurus rex will send chills up the spines of Bronx Zoo adventurers. 

 At the end of the experience, there is a field site that includes a fossil dig for children; a Tyrannosaurus rex photo-op; a paleontologist’s tent that includes a fossil museum; and an interactive robotic dinosaur that illustrates how the animatronics work. 

   Dinosaur Safari: Mysteries Revealed is limited engagement and will run from Saturday, April 12 through Sunday, November 2.  The attraction is included in the Total Experience Ticket. 

Other Dinosaur Safari-themed activities and performances will take place throughout the zoo. Visit www.bronxzoo.com/dino for schedules and event details.

Photo and interview opportunities with Bronx Zoo guests will be available.
