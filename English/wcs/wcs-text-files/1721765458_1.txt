Geneva, Aug. 22, 2019 – The following was released today by the Wildlife Conservation Society from CITES CoP18 concerning elephants and ivory:  Said Dr. Susan Lieberman, VP of International Policy for the Wildlife Conservation Society: “The decisions today by the Parties at CITES CoP18 mean it’s status quo for elephants: No international commercial ivory trade is permitted and that is what needs to happen. CITES Parties agreed not to open any ivory trade, and to further call on governments to close their domestic ivory markets. “At the end of the day and after all the debates: It’s about ivory trade. We thank the CITES CoP18 Parties for not weakening their policies concerning elephant ivory. All Ivory trade must end if the African elephant is to recover.” ### For WCS positions and for great background on the four elephant proposals go here. See Pages 11-14.
