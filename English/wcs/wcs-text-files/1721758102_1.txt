Brooklyn, NY – This summer, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium is offering week long camps for children ages 6 through 12. Campers will engage in special investigations and creative projects, play interactive games, meet animal guests and much more. Each day will be a great educational and exciting experience.

 

Learning is fun when it includes behind-the-scenes visits, strolls on the beach, lots of make-it-and-take-it art activities, opportunities to touch living sea stars and animal biofacts such as whale bones and shark teeth, and exhibit visits to observe our marine animals. Each session is age appropriate for the most fun and learning. Reservations are required for all sessions. Sessions can fill up quickly, so make your reservations early. For a brochure or to make reservations, call 718-265-3457 or visit www.nyaquarium.com.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
