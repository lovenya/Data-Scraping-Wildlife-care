After their mother was tranquilized in the family den, these black bear cubs in Nevada recently found themselves visited by field scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Nevada Department of Wildlife. The scientists collected data on the cub’s health, sex, and color, implanted each with microchips and then placed the three back in the den with Mama bear. The chips enable scientists to monitor cub survival rate and track them as they grow older. WCS and its partners are working to inform bear conservation in the wild throughout North America –including how to reduce conflicts with humans.

Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
