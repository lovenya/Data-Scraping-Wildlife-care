Painted storks are large wading birds native to tropical regions of Asia. They are named for their striking black, white, and pink wing feathers, orange beaks, and pink legs. The rest of the plumage is largely white. The Prospect Park Zoo is home to a variety of beautiful exotic birds. Examples include Victoria crown pigeons, aracari toucans, wreathed hornbills, parrot finches, owls, and free roaming peafowl. The painted storks can be found in the zoo’s Discovery Trail aviary. WCS works to conserve landscapes in Asia that are home to critical populations of painted storks and a host of other wildlife.
