						Hurleyville Performing Arts Centre (HPAC) and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Rocky Mountain Program (WCS Rockies) are thrilled to announce the launch of their collaborative project: NatureCultures, a special series opening on April 21st in celebration of Earth Day. NatureCultures is a virtual, mixed-media series created to explore humanity’s relationship with the wild through performance art, conversation, and collective action.  The new series, presented by WCS Rockies and HPAC, will unfold in three distinct phases, each exploring conservation through a different medium. The first, titled NatureSpeaks, kicks off on April 21 and will consist of spoken word, poetry, and creative nonfiction. This is a unique collaborative effort with Street Poets Inc., a Los Angeles based non-profit that works to create transformative experiences through the power of poetry and song and the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), a premier educational institution for Native arts and cultures. “Humanity is living through four interrelated global crises: biodiversity, climate, pandemic, and social justice. We need strategies that get at the root of these challenges and give rise to enduring solutions that rewild humanity and nature. WCS Rockies is honored to partner in this NatureCultures series, an unruly, mixed media celebration of the Wild World, to do just that,” said Cristina Mormorunni, WCS, Director, U.S. Field Conservation & Regional Director, Rocky Mountain Program. “Poetry acts as a tool for opening portals in the pavement to mysterious natural places… places that reveal our relationship to the gifts and wounds of our culture; where we gain access to the medicine to heal - the medicine that lies nearest the wound,” reflects Chris Henrikson, Executive Director of Street Poets Inc. on the importance of poetic art form as part of the program. The second installment, NatureCultures Rising, will begin on June 21st. The transdisciplinary panel discussion is designed to examine and reimagine humanity’s relationship with the wild world. Buffalo Circle and will conclude the series with a month-long celebration of the bison, America’s national mammal will honor the animal through artwork, digital storytelling and community engagement. “All organizations involved in NatureCultures connect through the desire to listen to and celebrate the astounding wild voices of people, places, and creatures that call us to action,” says Ellyane Hutchinson, Chief Operations Officer at HPAC. She continues, “We’re using storytelling to illustrate how we are all impacted by environmental disaster and social injustice, and how the two are intertwined.” NatureSpeaks includes artists from urban Los Angeles, writers, conservationists and educators from the mountains of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and organizers from the rural east coast in an effort to elevate the diversity of voices and experiences that are speaking on behalf of the more than human world. The virtual opening night event will take place Wednesday, April 21st at 7:30pmE DT (5:30M DT/4:30 PDT). NatureSpeaks will run 90 minutes and include readings by guest poets as well as an interactive community dialogue session. The event is free with donations suggested upon registration.
