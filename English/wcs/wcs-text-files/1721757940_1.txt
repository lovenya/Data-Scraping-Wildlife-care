2010 Brings Back Summer Camp for Kids



Flushing, N.Y., January 26 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo has announced it will
be bringing back its educational summer camp for kids this year. Although it’s
been several years since the zoo held this exciting summer-time program, it’s
now back in full-swing and will teach children about the world of wildlife
through games, crafts and a variety of hands-on activities. 



Kids of all ages are welcome to participate. Younger
children will discover animals by playing games and interacting with live farm
animals. The older participants
will take part in fun research activities and will even get to work directly
with the wild animal keepers.
