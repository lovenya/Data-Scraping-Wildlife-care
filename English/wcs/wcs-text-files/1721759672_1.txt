Educational, fun activities are planned to get youngsters excited about nature



Flushing, N.Y. – Nov. 9, 2011 – The Wildlife Conservation
Society’s Queens Zoo is hosting an educational winter camp for children ages 6
to 10 on Wednesday and Thursday, December 28 and 29.



The Queens Zoo is all
outdoors and is especially beautiful during the fall and winter months and is a
particularly scenic place for kids to learn about animals and nature. Games,
crafts and other activities will introduce kids to the world of animals and the
environment.  



No zoo camp would be
complete without a meet-and-greet with the animal residents. Participants will
learn how animals native to North and South America adapt to winter weather at animal
presentations in the zoo’s education classroom. 



Winter camp will be held Wednesday
and Thursday, December 28 and 29 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Members: $125;
Non-members: $150.
