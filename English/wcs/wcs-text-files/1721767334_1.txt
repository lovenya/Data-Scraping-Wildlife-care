						It’s clear that whales have become regular “New Yorkers” as evidenced by these recent images taken by scientists with the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Ocean Giants Program, showing a humpback whale within sight of the New York City skyline. The images were captured last Wednesday, August 2nd on a clear and calm day, just 11-12 miles from WCS’s New York Aquarium in Coney Island, Brooklyn. The WCS team was on the water identifying individual whales, recording their behavior, and collecting tissue samples for analysis. The research is helping to establish important baselines about whales off New York and New Jersey, and will hopefully inform decisions in these extremely busy waterways to reduce current and any forthcoming potential impacts.
