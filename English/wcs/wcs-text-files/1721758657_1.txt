Annual Boo at the Zoo and Ascarium Celebrations at the WCS Zoos and Aquarium

 


New York – Rebecca, a Hamadryas baboon, carries her son Azizi on
her back while she holds a piece of pumpkin.  Animals get treats too at
Boo at the Zoo at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo
– the spooky Halloween celebration includes haunted attractions, a
costume parade, face painting, music, magic, and Halloween themed
enrichment for the animals.

 

WCS’s Bronx, Queens, and Prospect Park Zoos are holding their annual
Boo at the Zoo, and the New York Aquarium is holding its annual
Halloween Ascarium events on select weekends throughout October.  Dates
and details are available on each facility’s website. 

 

Boo at the Zoo and Ascarium at all WCS wildlife parks are presented by Pepsi with supporting sponsor CLEAR.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places
worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and
the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks,
led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change
attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans
living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is
essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
