The following tribute was issued today by Dr. John Robinson, Executive Vice President of Conservation and Science for the Wildlife Conservation Society: “All of us at WCS are deeply saddened by the death of Esmond Bradley Martin, a friend, colleague, researcher and committed activist, who taught us about wildlife trade surveys, and promoted elephant and rhino conservation globally over several decades. “We extend deep condolences to his wife, family and friends. “Esmond was highly respected for his courageous investigative work into the black markets of elephant ivory and rhino horn. His research informed policy and practice, at national and international levels, that addressed the trafficking of elephants and rhinos. The impact of his work on wildlife conservation will be felt for decades to come. The conservation community has lost a champion, and he will be greatly missed.” ###
