						WASHINGTON (March 23, 2018) – WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) Executive Vice President of Public Affairs John Calvelli issued the following statement on the Fiscal Year 2018 omnibus appropriations bill passed by Congress: “We are pleased that Congress has just passed an appropriations bill that will be very good news for international wildlife conservation. By supporting several essential conservation and wildlife trafficking accounts and programs, they are making the world a safer and more prosperous place – for both wildlife and people. “Key federal accounts within State and Foreign Operations appropriations, including the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Development Assistance account; Biodiversity program; Sustainable Landscapes and other important programs were supported, along with the U.S. contribution to the Global Environment Facility. Within Interior appropriations, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Multinational Species Conservation Funds, Office of Law Enforcement, and Office of International Affairs all received similar levels as FY17. Other programs, including the U.S. Forest Service’s International Forestry Program, the Marine Mammal Commission, the Institute for Museum and Library Services, and ocean conservation programs with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were preserved. All of these programs and agencies promote good governance, law enforcement, and U.S. national and economic security while advancing conservation.  “We thank Congress and call on the President to sign this common sense omnibus appropriations bill to ensure that critically needed programs and agencies that address wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, international conservation and other priorities are sufficiently funded.”   ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
