						Bronx, New York – Nov. 8, 2017 – The new Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure is now open after dark for an exciting night climbing experience.   Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure is an aerial climbing experience featuring seven ropes courses of varying skill levels, and a zipline that runs more than 400 feet across the Bronx River and back – 50 feet above the water. Lights have been added to each of the ropes courses and the two ziplines to give adventurers a new night time perspective. The extended hours for night climbing are available on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and some holidays, through the end of the season. The Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure is ticketed separately from the Bronx Zoo. Visit www.BronxZooTreetop.com for more information and to make reservations.
