Brooklyn, N.Y. – Feb. 18, 2016 – Two Bolivian titi monkeys (Callicebus donacophilus) are making their public debut at WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) Prospect Park Zoo. The two new titi monkeys, a male and a female, share their habitat with a pair of white-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia pithecia). Both species are New World monkeys, indigenous to South America. Titis and sakis have overlapping ranges in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia; titi monkeys are also found in northern Paraguay. Titi monkeys are arboreal and diurnal, meaning they dwell in trees and are active during the day. Their diet in the wild, as well as at the zoo, consists of fruits, leaves, and insects. The new titis live in the zoo’s Hall of Animals Building. Other monkey species at the Prospect Park Zoo include Geoffroy’s marmosets (Callithrix geoffroyi), Geoffroy’s tamarins (Saguinus geoffroyi), golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia), and hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas). WCS’s Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo are celebrating the Year of the Monkey with special activities to ring in the Lunar New Year. Activities at the Prospect Park Zoo are Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 27 and 28. Activities at the Queens Zoo are Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 20 and 21.
