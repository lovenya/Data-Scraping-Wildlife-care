Animal Behavior & Conservation Connections (ABCC) will present two different shows each day at 11:30am and 2pm. Each show will feature different species and different behaviors. With gorgeous colors and amazing mid-air acrobatics, macaws, condors, falcons, hawks, vultures, owls and more will demonstrate their natural flight behaviors while the presenters teach onlookers about the conservation needs of the species. Some zoo guests may have the opportunity for an even more intimate interaction with the birds as volunteers are selected from the crowd to serve as perching for some of the birds. After each show, ABCC will offer guests the opportunity to meet some of the birds and learn more about their training, behaviors, and personalities. “Birds in Flight” is free with a general admission ticket. In addition to the scheduled weekend shows, there will be shows on Wednesday, May 11 as part of the Bronx Week festivities and there will be shows on Monday, May 30 for the Memorial Day holiday.
