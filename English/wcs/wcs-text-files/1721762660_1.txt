						Newborn gorillas make debut as Bronx Zoo marks the beginning of the summer seasonPresented by Con Edison: WCS’s Run for the Wild on Saturday, April 25 is dedicated to saving gorillas and other wildlife WCSRunfortheWild.org 		Congo Gorilla Forest has raised more than $12 million for WCS conservation programs since 1999 - vote for best zoo exhibit at http://bit.ly/1EVhD5o  B-roll download: BZ Gorilla babies 04-15-2015 B-roll h.264.mov Bronx, NY – April 15, 2015 – Two infant western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are making their public debut at WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) Bronx Zoo. This is the second pair of gorillas born at the Bronx Zoo in just over a year. The Bronx Zoo has a successful history breeding gorillas as part of the Species Survival Plan, a cooperative breeding program designed to enhance the genetic viability of animal populations in zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These are the 16th and 17th gorillas born at Congo Gorilla Forest; there have been 52 gorillas born at the Bronx Zoo since 1972. Layla (16 years old) gave birth on January 17th, and Kumi (also 16 years old) had her baby on January 19th. Ernie (32 years old) is the father of both babies. The gender of the infants is not yet known and the times they are on exhibit will vary day-by-day depending on weather, temperature, and other environmental factors. The Congo Gorilla Forest is now home to 19 gorillas – the largest group of gorillas in North America – living in two breeding troops along with a troop of young males. This award-winning habitat has raised more than $12 million for WCS’s conservation programs in Africa through admission fees. Those who want to recognize Congo Gorilla Forest as the best zoo exhibit can vote at http://bit.ly/1EVhD5o. On Saturday, April 25, WCS will host the 7th annual WCS Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo.  Runners, walkers, and wildlife supporters are invited to participate in the annual 5K run/walk to save gorillas and other wildlife. Registration is now open at wcsrunforthewild.com. Participants and supporters can spend the day at the Bronx Zoo after the run/walk and see the young gorillas in person. Gorillas are the world’s largest primates. Weighing only about 4 to 5 pounds at birth, adult males weigh between 350-450 pounds and when standing upright can be up to six feet tall. Adult females weigh between 150-250 pounds and are up to four feet tall.  Western lowland gorillas are designated as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their natural range spans tropical and subtropical forests in equatorial Africa. WCS works throughout Central Africa to protect gorillas from habitat loss and illegal hunting.  WCS Run for the Wild is made possible by these generous sponsors and corporate partners: Presented by:                       Con Edison Featured Sponsor:             Montefiore Medical Center Supporting Sponsors:        Empire BlueCross BlueShield; Monroe College Media Partners:                 ABC-7; Z-100 Promotional Partners:     The Belmont Business Improvement District;                                                 Residence Inn Marriott - The Bronx at Metro Center Atrium  The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays, 5:30 p.m. weekends from April to October; 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m November to March.
