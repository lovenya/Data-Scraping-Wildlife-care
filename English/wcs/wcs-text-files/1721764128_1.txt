						Bronx, N.Y. – February 23, 2017 – The 2017 WCS Run for the Wild is scheduled for Saturday, April 29. Runners, walkers, and wildlife supporters are invited to participate in the 9th annual 5K race and family fun run/walk at the Bronx Zoo.  Each year, WCS Run for the Wild is committed to raising awareness of the threats facing wildlife while raising money to help WCS conservation work at the Bronx Zoo and around the world. This year runners and walkers can choose to participate on behalf of whichever species most inspires them. Since its inception in 2009, more than more than 40,000 people have participated at the Bronx Zoo. Registration is now open and there are many ways to participate. Visit www.wcsrunforthewild.org to register for the run or family fun walk; make a donation; or support a friend or team. Registration for the run is $50 for adults, $40 for children (3–15), and $40 for seniors (65+). All WCS members receive a discount on registration. Participants are encouraged to fundraise and seek individual sponsors for their individual effort. All adult (and senior) participants are required to raise a minimum of $30 in order to participate. The price of registration includes parking and general admission to the Bronx Zoo on the day of the event. Total Experience Ticket upgrade is available on site. Registrants can choose from two different events. The 5K run for individual runners will begin at 8:00 a.m.; casual runners and walkers can take part in the Family Fun Run/Walk at 8:45 a.m. After the run, everyone is encouraged to stay at the Bronx Zoo to enjoy the wildlife and race-day activities. Enjoy a local microbrew at the beer garden (age 21 and above); burn off some extra energy on the rock climbing wall; or dance to some tunes on the Bronx Zoo’s historic Astor Court. A full listing of race day activities is available at www.wcsrunforthewild.com. The zoo’s marquee exhibits will be open for everyone to enjoy for the day. All are welcome to visit the Bronx Zoo’s animal ambassadors for extra inspiration and to learn about the conservation work WCS is doing to save wildlife and wild places around the globe. Exhibits like Tiger Mountain, Madagascar!, and African Plains are just a few of the exhibits that will bring people face-to-face with some of the species that they are helping to save through their participation in or support of WCS Run for the Wild. Prizes will be awarded to those who meet various fundraising goals. For $30 in pledges, runners will earn a WCS Run for the Wild T-shirt; $75 earns a plush animal; $150 earns a water bottle; $300 earns a tote bag; $600 earns a yoga mat; $1,000 earns Bronx Zoo tickets; $1,500 earns a VIP brunch. Each ascending incentive level achieved includes ALL prizes from the lower levels. The event is expected to sell out, so runners and walkers are encouraged to sign up early.
