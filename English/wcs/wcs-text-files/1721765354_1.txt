						The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) held its annual gala at the spectacular Central Park Zoo where 600 guests celebrated WCS’s impact on protecting the planet’s most ecologically important wild places and the extraordinary species that call them home.Gala 2019 honored entrepreneur, philanthropist and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his dedication to conservation, protecting the world’s oceans and coral reefs, and combatting climate change.Said WCS Chair Alejandro Santo Domingo: “Mike Bloomberg has demonstrated that a global leader taking local action can change the world. His commitment to protecting the world’s oceans and coral reefs from the effects of climate change and other threats has led to a fruitful partnership with WCS through the Vibrant Oceans initiative. Mike Bloomberg’s strong focus on climate change has been truly inspirational.”WCS President and CEO Cristian Samper said: “As we work together to tackle the causes and impacts of climate change, we must embrace nature-based solutions like wetlands and forests that help to store carbon and enhance resilience to today’s storms. We must also work together to preserve wild places—nature’s strongholds on land and sea—that provide animals and people with protection, food, and shelter. Here at WCS, that’s exactly what we’re doing. As we approach our 125th anniversary in 2020, we can point to decades of successful, science-driven, field-based conservation impact in 60 countries around the world.”Said Michael R. Bloomberg: “We must do all we can to leave our planet healthier and stronger than we found it. The Wildlife Conservation Society has been committed to that work for over 100 years. Thank you for this honor, and to everyone who has been a part of this mission – because your work is important now more than ever.” About the GalaGala 2019 celebrated Conservation for a Sustainable Future and WCS’s impact on protecting the planet’s most ecologically important wild places and the extraordinary species that call them home.
