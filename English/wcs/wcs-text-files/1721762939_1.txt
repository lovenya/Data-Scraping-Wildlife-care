We commend Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins and Senator Ricardo Lara for championing the bill. And we thank the public and our fellow bill sponsors The Humane Society of the United States, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oakland Zoo and California Association of Zoos and Aquariums for their tireless efforts to support AB96.” The bill will go back to the Assembly (where it already passed on June 2nd) for a concurrence vote due to minor amendments made in the Senate before it reaches the governor’s desk shortly.Calvelli added: “The ivory issue is not something that’s only happening half a world away – there is a major ivory market right here in the U.S., and California is among the largest consumers.  Now, California is poised to play a direct role in saving elephants from the ravages of the illegal wildlife trade. “The goal of 96 Elephants – named after the number of elephants gunned down each day in Africa by poachers – is to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand.  Banning the sale of ivory is a key step toward stopping the demand. “The California legislature has shown real leadership on this issue. WCS and 96 Elephants urge Governor Brown to now sign AB 96 into law so that elephants can be further protected from poachers’ guns and wildlife traffickers.” ### Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
