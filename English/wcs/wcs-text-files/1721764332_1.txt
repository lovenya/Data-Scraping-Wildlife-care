						CONEY ISLAND, NY (June 8, 2017) – A team of staff, volunteers, partners and educators from WCS’s New York Aquarium cleaned the beach at Kaiser Park in Coney Island, Brooklyn today to celebrate World Oceans Day.  The group cleaned the beach for nearly three hours, filling ten 55-gallon bags with trash, almost all of which was single-use plastics – bags, utensils, bottles, and caps.  Earlier today, WCS announced the 30-Day Plastics Challenge to reduce use of single-use disposable plastics, and to bring attention to the fact that, by some estimates, a staggering 5 trillion pieces of plastic are currently floating in the world’s oceans. Staff participating in the clean-up included the team who leads the Wildlife Conservation Corps –  teen volunteers at the aquarium – along with volunteers from Google, PowerPlay NYC, and Brooklyn Lightning track club.  Special thanks to the New York City Parks Foundation for helping coordinate the event. Said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium: “I am proud of the staff and volunteers of the WCS New York Aquarium for tackling plastic pollution in Coney Island Creek at Kaiser Park.” The clean-up took place on World Oceans Day and during the UN Ocean Conference which is taking place this week.  The conference gathers experts from around the world to work on achieving Sustainable Development Goal 14 – to sustainably use and conserve the world’s oceans and marine resources. Other World Oceans Day events taking place through WCS’s New Aquarium include: installation of the ocean plastics themed murals on the Coney Island Boardwalk; yoga classes on the Coney Island beach; fun educational activities; and more ###
