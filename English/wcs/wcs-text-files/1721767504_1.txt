Dubai, Dec. 9, 2023 – The following statement was issued today by Daneil Zarin, Executive Director of Forests and Climate Change at the Wildlife Conservation Society:

“With just a few days left in the negotiations, here is what we need ministers to do at COP28 in Dubai.:


 Use the Global Stocktake to align all countries with 1.5C targets
 Commit their own countries to implement their "Nationally Determined Contributions" (NDCs) with 1.5C targets no later than 2025
 Commit to cut global emissions by 43% before 2030
 Immediately deploy at least US $100 billion/year for loss and damage
 Protect rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and ensure direct finance for them
 Align biodiversity and climate policies and targets


“Are we hopeful that Ministers will deliver? Signals remain mixed. Stay tuned.”
