						Coney Island, NY – April 19, 2018  – The WCS New York Aquarium has opened an ocean-side grill that will serve up sustainable seafood and tips on how to eat responsibly as stewards of the world’s ocean. The grill is a no single-use plastic zone. All food is served on environmentally-friendly packaging: no plastic straws, cups, bags or other items.   The Oceanside Grill is now open on Saturday and Sunday (11am to 7pm) and will be open seven days a week starting on Memorial Day, May 28, (9am to 9pm on weekends; 9am to 7pm on weekdays).    “Our new Oceanside Grill is serving exceptionally delicious and sustainable seafood items – like fish tacos and fish and chips – and providing an education on how we all can be ocean-friendly consumers,” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium.  “The grill is located on the boardwalk allowing us to reach the millions of visitors to Coney Island each summer with a friendly conservation message and an enjoyable place to sit in the shade with views of the ocean.   “At the New York Aquarium we educate our visitors each day about how everyone can be stewards of the ocean. Now we have taken our messaging to the millions more enjoying the boardwalk and beach in Coney Island.”   The New York Aquarium is actively involved in conservation work, including its WCS New York Seascape project, which includes conservation work in the New York Bight from Cape May, NJ to Montauk NY.   Learn more about going plastic straw free with the NY Aquairum here.
