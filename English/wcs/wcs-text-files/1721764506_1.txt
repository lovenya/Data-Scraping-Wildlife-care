						Bronx, NY – Aug. 31, 2017 – A baby Angolan colobus monkey (Colobus angolensis) was born this month in the Congo Gorilla Forest at WCS’s Bronx Zoo and is currently on exhibit. With the addition of the baby, whose gender is yet to be determined, there are six colobus monkeys in the troop; one adult male, two adult females, one juvenile female, and one juvenile male. The species is native to northern Angola and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a second population found in Tanzania and Kenya. They are arboreal and live in thick jungle ecosystems. Their slim bodies and long tails help them balance while moving through treetops in search of leaves, fruits and seeds to eat. These African primates typically live in family groups of up to 15 individuals. One dominant male will lead the troop and mate with all of the adult females.  The young are born completely white and begin changing to their adult coloration when about three months of age. The offspring are cared for by all the females in the troop. Although their population is classified as “Least Concern” by the The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Angolan colobus monkeys are threatened by habitat loss from deforestation and agriculture. The Wildlife Conservation Society works throughout Africa and within the colobus money’s range to save wildlife and their habitats.
