These curious dwarf mongoose pups take shelter in a hollow log in their new home at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo.  The pups are two of the three recently born dwarf mongoose at WCS's Bronx Zoo.  Native to sub-Saharan Africa, these dwarf mongooses are the smallest carnivores in Africa.  The dwarf mongoose is a social creature that lives in small groups led by a dominant male and female.  These three pups and their parents can be seen on exhibit in the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo Carter Giraffe Building.  Also on exhibit are two dwarf mongooses in the Mouse House.
