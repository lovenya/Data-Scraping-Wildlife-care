The Following statement is by John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs: “WCS applauds Governor Cuomo and the New York State Senate and Assembly for including in the state budget $300M of historic funding for the Environmental Protection Fund (EPF), and a $1M increase in funding to the Zoos, Botanical Gardens, and Aquariums (ZBGA) Program.  New York’s zoos, botanical gardens, aquariums and parks are a gateway for untold millions of New Yorkers to become stewards of wildlife and wild places. Having these important facilities properly funded enriches us all.”
