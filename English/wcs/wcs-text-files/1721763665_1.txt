						Saranac Lake, NY (July 1, 2016) - The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Adirondack Program today announced a call for volunteers to help census loons on Adirondack lakes as part of the 16th Annual Adirondack Loon Census taking place from 8:00–9:00 a.m. on Saturday, July 16.  With the help of local Adirondack residents and visitor volunteers, the census enables WCS to collect important data on the status of the breeding loon population in and around the Adirondack Park and across New York State. The results help guide management decisions and policies affecting loons.   Census volunteers report on the number of adult and immature loons and loon chicks that they observe during the hour-long census. Similar loon censuses will be conducted in other states throughout the Northeast simultaneously, and inform a regional overview of the population’s current status.    Anyone interested in volunteering can get more information about how to sign up by visiting www.wcsadirondacks.org , or by calling 518-891-8874 ext. 102 or emailing wcsaccp@gmail.com.     “The Annual Loon Census engages over 500 citizen science volunteers each year” said Zoë Smith, Director of WCS’s Adirondack Program.  “We are grateful to the people who participate in this important research.  We are always looking for additional participation to help us learn about the current status and future population of the Common loon in New York State.”    ###
