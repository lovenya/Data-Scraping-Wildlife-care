						WCS co-authored a paper published yesterday in Nature Ecology & Evolution that debates whether to publicize the location of endangered species.  Scientists publishing locations of rare species have been blamed for helping poachers drive them to extinction, such as the local extinction of the Chinese cave gecko. The paper, led by Dr Ayesha Tulloch from the University of Sydney and the University of Queensland, argues that data publishing is important to help many species.
