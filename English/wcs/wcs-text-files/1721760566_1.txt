Oct. 30, 2012CONTACT: MARY DIXON, 347-840-1242, mdixon@wcs.org The Wildlife Conservation Society's New York Aquarium, located in an evacuation zone in Coney Island, experienced severe flooding from the storm surge associated with Hurricane Sandy.  The entire 14-acre facility was under water. As the water recedes, we will need time to assess the full extent of the damage. Our staff remain at the aquarium after working throughout the storm. WCS's four zoos -- the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo -- do not appear to have experienced serious damage. The aquarium will remain closed until further notice and we will provide information regarding the re-opening of the zoos in a later statement.
