						Hosted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in partnership with I Love NY, the inaugural Cycle Adirondacks is in full gear as the riders have reached the half-way point of the week-long tour.   More than 150 riders from 30 states and two Canadian provinces are enjoying the hospitality of the host-towns and exploring the natural beauty of the Adirondacks. Many of the first time visitors are already talking about coming back. If you want to check out the action from each day’s events, see videos from the ride, and amazing photography of the riders and the route, click here for Facebook coverage and here for the Cycle Adirondacks website. During the day, riders are experiencing a route that boasts thousands of acres of scenic vistas and wildlife habitat, 35 quaint towns, and welcoming local residents. WCS has identified more than 50 unique points of interest that are being interpreted for the riders by scientists and naturalists along the entire route. Net proceeds of Cycle Adirondacks will support WCS’s community-based conservation program which focuses on engaging directly with local leaders to advance sustainable development projects that benefit both people and wildlife. WCS is a trusted leader in the Adirondack region, providing science and support to help advance regional discussions and resolve conservation issues. Locally-based nonprofit groups and area schools throughout the region of the ride will also benefit from the event with small grants in exchange for their involvement as volunteers. Over 200 people are pitching in to volunteer for this event. WCS received a marketing grant from I Love New York through the Mohawk Valley Regional Economic Development Council to help build and promote Cycle Adirondacks.
