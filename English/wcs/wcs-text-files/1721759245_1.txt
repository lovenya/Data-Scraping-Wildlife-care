		    New York, NY – May 6, 2011- Two young, female California sea lions have a new home at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo.    Edith, 9 months, was born at WCS’s New York Aquarium, and Katie, 2 years, was born at WCS’s Bronx Zoo. Both are named in honor of long-standing WCS trustees—Edith McBean and Katherine L. (Katie) Dolan.   The two new youngsters join Scooter, 25, and April, 20, in the sea lion court. Edith and Katie have begun participating in the daily enrichment sessions and they are learning very quickly how to earn fishy snacks.   “We are pleased to announce the arrival of Katie and Edith to our sea lion family at Central Park Zoo,” said Jeff Sailer, Director of City Zoos. “They are young and playful and will add a lot of energy to the sea lion pool and the daily feeding demonstrations.” The sea lions are fed every day at 11:30 a.m., 2, and 4 p.m. During this time the keepers perform enrichment that provides the sea lions with mental and physical exercise. They work with the animals to strengthen bonds, stimulate natural instincts and behaviors, and facilitate care.  California sea lions live in large groups on the western coast of North America. Newborns weigh about 13 pounds and females grow to about 200 pounds as adults. There are an estimated 300,000 sea lions in the wild.     Contact:
