Black-and-white hawk eagles, tricolored bats, and huge clouds of butterflies. These wildlife sightings make up just some of the 365 newly documented species in Bahuaja Sonene National Park (BSNP) in southeastern Peru. 

A group of WCS researchers and their colleagues recently inventoried BSNPâ€™s plant life, insects, birds, mammals, and reptiles. In total, they found 30 undocumented bird species, 2 undocumented mammals, and 233 species of butterflies and moths. The park was created in 1996, and this expedition marked the first time that researchers had surveyed its wildlife on such a large scale.
