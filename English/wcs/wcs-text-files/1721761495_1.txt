The miniature zebu is one of the oldest and smallest breeds of cattle 

Brooklyn, N.Y. – Dec. 4, 2013 - The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo is home to two new miniature zebus (Bos taurus indicus).

The zebu is one of the oldest breeds of cattle, believed to have originated in southern India around 6,000 years ago. 

The two zebus at the Prospect Park Zoo are both less than a year old and are a male/female pair. Both have small horns on top of their heads, which is signature of the breed. While zebus can be various colors such as black, reddish, gray or white, the pair at the Prospect Park Zoo is light gray with white underneath. The cow is distinguished from the bull by the reddish tuft on top of her head. 

Although a diminutive breed, adult miniature zebus can weigh up to 500 pounds and measure three to four feet in length. Unlike larger breeds of cattle, miniature zebus are slow to mature, reaching adulthood between ages 2 to 3 years. 

As grazers, the zoo’s pair eats mostly hay. They live in the zoo’s barn area along with sheep, goats, turkeys, a variety of chickens and geese, miniature horses, and other domestic animals.
