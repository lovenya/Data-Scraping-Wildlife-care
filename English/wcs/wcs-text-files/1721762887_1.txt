The calf was born on July, 21 and is nursing, but as a grazing animal, will move to a diet of mostly hay. The zebu is one of the oldest breeds of cattle, believed to have originated in southern India around 6,000 years ago. Although a diminutive breed, adult mini zebus can weigh up to 500 pounds and measure three to four feet in length. Unlike larger breeds of cattle, mini zebus are slow to mature, reaching maturity in two to three years. Characteristic of the breed, both male and female zebus have small horns on top of their heads. While zebus can be various colors such as black, reddish, gray, or white, the three at the Prospect Park Zoo all sport a light gray coat with white underneath.  The Prospect Park Zoo’s zebu family lives alongside other domestic animals in the barn area including sheep, goats, turkeys, and miniature horses.
