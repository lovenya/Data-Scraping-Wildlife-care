Indy, a female California sea lion, “porpoises” during an enrichment activity at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo.  The animal keepers at the Bronx Zoo provide daily enrichment, like training, to the animals to help keep them mentally and physically active and healthy. California sea lions are strong swimmers and divers.  The sea lion pool is located on Astor Court and is home to two additional adults and two young sea lion pups born last summer.  Enrichment session are daily at 10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. 

The sea lion enrichment is just one of many attractions planned for spring.  WCS's Bronx Zoo will be kicking off the season with Animal Tales Extravaganza; every weekend in April, May, and June will be packed with family-oriented entertainment.  And don't miss the second annual Run for the Wild on Saturday, April 24th at WCS's Bronx Zoo.
