In a National Geographic blog post, WCS conservationists Renee Seidler and Jon Beckmann detail WCS’s efforts to protect the “Path of the Pronghorn” inthe West. The path spans the distance between Grand Teton National Park to Wyoming’s Upper Green River Basin and hosts one of the longest terrestrial migrations in the contiguous U.S. Thanks in part to WCS efforts, highway overpasses and underpasses are now under construction to reduce automobile collisions and protect pronghorn on their seasonal journeys.																																				“Each individual animal will average only three days to travel the entire 150 kilometer distance as they hurry south through the difficult terrain and challenging weather conditions—much as pronghorn have done along the Path for 6,000 years.  But only more recently have the animals faced the myriad threats of fences, roads, rural sprawl, energy development infrastructure, and other impediments that fragment their habitat and the passages that link them.”																												Read more on the migration and the work to protect it in National Geographic's Daily News >>
