						NEW YORK - December 22, 2020 – WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) released today its favorite images of 2020. Ten of the images come from WCS’s Bronx Zoo and other wildlife parks, and ten images are from WCS’s Global Conservation Programs taken by WCS scientists working around the world. This year, each set includes an 11th Honorable Mention photo that has special significance that warranted inclusion in the 2020 list. WCS operates five wildlife parks in New York City (Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, and Queens Zoo) and works in nearly 60 countries and across the world's ocean saving wildlife and wild places. WCS zoo and aquarium images: CAPTIONS and credits for included #1103 – BRONX ZOO AMBULANCE DEPOT: Hundreds of ambulances and emergency personnel from around the country descended on New York City in April 2020 at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis. The Bronx Zoo opened its parking lots and served as a home base for the visiting ambulances. Another parking lot at the Bronx Zoo was used by Montefiore Medical Center as a COVID-19 testing site. PHOTO CREDIT: Bronx Zoo © WCS #1324 – AMERICAN BISON BABY BOOM: Eight pure American Bison (Bison bison) were born at the Bronx Zoo in 2020. The Bronx Zoo staff and scientists have been working to grow a herd of genetically pure bison that can eventually be used for future restoration programs in the American West. Bison have a significant place in the history of the Bronx Zoo. Bison born at the Bronx Zoo were reintroduced to the wild in the early 1900s when the species was on the verge of extinction.  PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #2330 – BROWN BEARS IN SNOW: Following the first major snowstorm of the season, the brown bears (Ursus arctos) at the Bronx Zoo explored their expansive exhibit while digging and rolling in more than a foot of snow. All of the brown bears at the zoo are rescues that were orphaned in the wild as cubs and would not have survived on their own.  PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #3260 – COMMON CUTTLEFISH AT NEW YORK AQUARIUM: The New York Aquarium opened a new exhibit in 2020. Spineless features marine invertebrate species including several species of jellyfish, Japanese spider crabs (Macrocheira kaempferi), and giant pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini). This photo of a common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) received an honorable mention in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ national photo contest.  PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #4861 – CANADA LYNX AND CUBS: The Queens Zoo welcomed three Canada lynx (Lynx Canadensis) cubs this summer. This photo of the lynx mom and one of her cubs was taken as the cubs began venturing out and exploring their habitat.  PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #5295 – GAUR: Since the fall of 2019, the herd of gaur (Bos gaurus) grew by 7, including two that were born while the zoo was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaur are native to southern Asia and are the world’s largest species of wild cattle. The Bronx Zoo gaur herd, which is the largest herd of gaur in zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, can be seen from the zoo’s Wild Asia Monorail.

The Bronx Zoo has a successful mandrill breeding program that has produced many offspring as part of the AZA’s Species Survival Plan, a cooperative breeding program between accredited zoos that works to ensure genetic diversity in zoo populations.             PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #5268 – RED-CRESTED TURACO AND HATCHLING: A rare hatching at the Bronx Zoo, this red-crested turaco (Tauraco erythrolophus) tends to her chick in the World of Birds. This Asian species is immediately recognizable with its green body, long tail and prominent red crest.  PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #6294 – RED-EYED TREE FROG: This red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) clings to a flower growing within its exhibit in the World of Reptiles at the Bronx Zoo. The beauty of the flower against the vibrant green skin and characteristic red eyes of the frog create one of the most colorful pictures of 2020.  PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #7982 – EYELASH VIPER: Those are not eyelashes. The scales above the eyes of the eyelash viper are thought to camouflage the snake’s eyes to help it hide while hunting prey. The eyelash viper (Bothriechis schlegelii), is a species of pit viper native to Central and South America.

All of the cats have fully recovered. This portrait of Nadia was featured in news outlets around the world.

He is the son of silverback Buka and mother Mapassa and is often seen wrestling with his older brother Paki Paki. They are habituated gorillas that WCS studies in its research center in Mondika, which celebrated its 25th birthday this year.

It was part of a survey for the evaluation of jaguar density and biodiversity of the park.  PHOTO CREDIT: WCS Guatemala/WCS #3 LUCKY MENHADEN*: WCS’s Ocean Giants team captured this amazing moment of a humpback whale lunge feeding off New York City, and one member of the schooling fish (Atlantic Menhaden) that seemingly managed to escape for the moment.   *PHOTO CREDIT MUST SAY: “WCS Ocean Giants IMAGE Taken under NMFS MMPA/ESA Permit no 18786-04 Anita Murray/WCS.” # 4 BLACK HOWLER MONKEY: Last April for an Earth Day feature called “Seeing is Believing” WCS released this image of a baby black howler monkey (Alouatta caraya) rescued in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve after fires ravaged its forest home. When the young monkey’s mother could not be found, it was sent by CONAP (Guatemala National Council of Protected Areas) to the ARCAS Wildlife Rescue Center for care and growth so it can returned to the wild.

The crossing was part of the new Trans Mongolian Railroad ‘Wildlife Friendly’ Fence Corridor, a project that creates simple modifications to existing fence designs that run the length of the railroad.

WCS works with local communities to safeguard this rarest gorilla species, which numbers only around 300 individuals living in an isolated region along the Nigeria/Cameroon border.  PHOTO CREDIT: WCS Nigeria #7 OKAPI IN OKAPI WILDLIFE RESERVE: In November, a WCS staff member took this beautiful image of an okapi (Okapia johnstoni) in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (OWR) in Democratic Republic of Congo. Okapi are rarely seen in the wild; good pics of them are ever rarer. WCS manages OWR and works to protect it from illegal mining, bushmeat hunting, and habitat loss from illegal settlements.

Months earlier, hundreds of adult females dug their nests along sandbars to lay their eggs.

The collars will help WCS monitor the elephants' movements and health and plan daily patrols to reduce poaching. WCS fought against a proposal to build a dam in Murchinson Falls. The plan was recently rejected by Ugandan lawmakers.
