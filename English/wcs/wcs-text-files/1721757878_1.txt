The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo is a winter wonderland for creatures of all types – animals and humans. As New York City digs out of its largest snowfall since 2006, this Siberian tiger at WCS’s Bronx Zoo playfully leaps on a snow-covered boulder at Tiger Mountain.

 

Winter weekend activities this year include the first Salute to Wildlife Ice-Carving Competition Sunday, December 27; holiday presents for the animals; Clydesdale horse and carriage rides; ice carving demonstrations; and more.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world’s largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
