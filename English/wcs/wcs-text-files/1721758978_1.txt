Presented by Con Edison, 2011 Run for the Wild is dedicated to saving penguins around the world

 

 

Bronx, NY – Jan. 25, 2011 – Magellanic penguins, Danny and Hugo, move through the snow covered rocks in the Russell B. Aitken Sea Bird Aviary at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo. This species is native to the southern South American coast and seas. Magellanic penguins live in large groups but mated couples remain monogamous for years. The third annual Run for the Wild 5k run/walk will be held at the Bronx Zoo on Saturday, April 30, 2011. This year’s event is dedicated to helping save penguins. Registration and sponsorship details are available at www.wcs.runforthewild.org. Magellanic Penguins are threatened by commercial fishing and habitat pollution. WCS works in coastal Patagonia to protect breeding sites and manage populations.
