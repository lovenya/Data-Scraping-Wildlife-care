Wednesday, the porcupine at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo, is having her cake and eating it too.

 

WCS’s Bronx Zoo recently celebrated this prehensile-tailed porcupine’s 14th birthday. Native to Central and South America, these porcupines are usually found in trees, using their tails to grasp branches. 

 

Last year, Wednesday became an internet sensation when she played a crucial role in the campaign to restore state funding to zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens across New York State. Videos of Wednesday getting laid off and seeking unemployment compensation gained national recognition as the videos went viral. This year, the 80 organizations funded by the state under the ZBGA budget line have to once again fight proposed budget cuts. Wednesday, however, has taken a break from the spotlight.
