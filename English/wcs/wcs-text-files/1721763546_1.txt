The family of titis live in a mixed-species exhibit in the Bronx Zoo’s World of Birds. Their habitat depicts a South American rainforest and also includes golden lion tamarins and gray-winged trumpeters, a bird species that opportunistically feeds on fruit dropped by primates. Bolivian gray titi monkeys are indigenous to central and northern Bolivia and their range extends into Brazil. They dwell in trees and are active during the day. Their diet consists of fruits, leaves, and insects. The species is small with thick, fluffy fur. As their name implies, their fur is often gray, although coloration can vary to include orange-brown on the belly and chest. The species is monogamous and males contribute to the rearing of offspring. Family pairs are often seen with their tails intertwined demonstrating  strong social bonds. WCS works throughout Latin America to save wildlife and wild places including areas where titi monkeys are found.   ###
