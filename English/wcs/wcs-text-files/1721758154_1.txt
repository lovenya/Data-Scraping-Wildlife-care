These white-naped cranes at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo are “calling,” a behavior seen in paired cranes.  Wingman, a 21-year-old male, and Crystal, an 18-year-old female, have been together for less than a year and have hatched their first chick.  White-naped cranes are native to northeastern China, and due to habitat loss are now endangered.  The WCS Bronx Zoo pioneered advances in incubation, hand-rearing and nutrition for these cranes.  These techniques have been used in zoos ever since to ensure the survival of the captive population.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
