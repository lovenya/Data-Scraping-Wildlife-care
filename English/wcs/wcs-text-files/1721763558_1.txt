						Bronx, NY – May 26, 2016 – The baby western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) born at the Bronx Zoo in 2014 and 2015 are a year older and ready for summer. Their playful interactions with their parents and one another give zoo visitors an opportunity to observe the family dynamics and see how their personalities have developed.  There are five gorilla toddlers in the Bronx Zoo’s award-winning Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit – all under two-and-a-half years old. Moms Layla, Kumi, and Suki gave birth to Kamara, Mokonzi and Kidogo Njemba in 2015. Julia and Tuti gave birth to Mjukuu and Lincoln in 2014. Ernie, the adult male silverback, sired each of the young gorillas. Lincoln was named by the Lane Family in recognition of their support for the care of the Bronx Zoo’s animals.  WCS’s Bronx Zoo has a successful history breeding gorillas as part of the Species Survival Plan, a cooperative breeding program designed to enhance the genetic viability of animal populations in zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The Congo Gorilla Forest home to one of the largest groups of gorillas in North America. There are two breeding troops along with a troop of young males. This award-winning habitat has raised more than $12 million for WCS’s conservation programs in Africa through admission fees.New photos and video of young Bronx Zoo gorillas:  HD video download: http://bit.ly/1YWpISU YouTube video: https://youtu.be/NqrJtYYnDuEPhotos (credit: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS): http://bit.ly/1sPFJQT
