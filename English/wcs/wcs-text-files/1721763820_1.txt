WCS’s New York Aquarium is the oldest continually operating aquarium in the United States, having opened to the public in Battery Park, Manhattan, in 1896. Since then, it has had a fascinating history and has been home to an exotic array of aquatic wildlife. This year’s Sip for the Sea focused on the future of the aquarium, including the construction of Ocean Wonders: Sharks!, and the ongoing field work being done by the NY Seascape, the aquarium’s local marine conservation program. With many fish species facing serious threats from overfishing, sustainable seafood options help ensure the longevity of diverse and healthy ocean ecosystems around the world.  Sip for the Sea attendees learned about marine conservation in the waters around New York and saw some of the Central Park Zoo’s amazing animals, including California sea lions, harbor seals, and more.  PROUD EVENT PARTNERS Presenting Sponsor: Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Supporting Sponsor: Blancpain Media Partner: Wine SpectatorSpecial Note to the Media: If you would like to guide your readers or viewers to a Web link where they can make donations in support of helping save wildlife and wild places, please direct them to wcs.org.
