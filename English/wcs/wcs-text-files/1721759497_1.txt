Commercial hunting and the bushmeat trade plague Cameroon’s
critically endangered Cross River gorillas, chimpanzees, forest elephants, and
other imperiled species. But the area and number of people involved in the
illegal trade make conventional law enforcement difficult. Economic and
political instabilities in Cameroon also complicate efforts to sustainably
manage its natural resources.

In this investigative piece from CNN, reporter Nkepile
Mabuse travels through the rainforests of Cameroon to look at the growing
illegal bushmeat trade. She also meets with WCS conservationist Roger Fotso to
learn how WCS works with the country’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry to
reduce poaching and improve law enforcement by limiting access to lucrative
urban bushmeat markets.Watch the video >>
