						BRONX, NY – May 23, 2023 – A new experience is opening at the Bronx Zoo Memorial Day weekend. Budgie Landing is an immersive walkthrough exhibit that includes more than 1000 colorful budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), commonly known as budgies.

Members of the media are invited to preview the Budgie Landing experience along with Bronx Zoo members 11a-3p on Thursday, May 25 and Friday, May 26. The exhibit will officially open to the public on Saturday, May 27 – just in time for Memorial Day weekend.

As Bronx Zoo guests walk through the habitat, they will be surrounded by the small, boisterous parrots flying freely through the exhibit. Each guest will have the opportunity to offer seeds to the birds from a handheld stick. Budgies that choose to accept the offering will create an unforgettable up-close interaction.

Budgie Landing at the Bronx Zoo was designed to replicate the Australian open woodlands and grasslands of their native range which spans the Australian continent. Although their natural coloration is green with white and black accents, their popularity as pets has inspired breeding of many colors including blue, grey, white, yellow, and combinations of each. Budgie Landing features more than 1000 birds in a wide variety of colors.
