    Brooklyn, N.Y. – Dec. 29, 2014: The zoo is home to six red-faced parrot finches (Erythrura psittacea). They have strikingly colorful plumage with green feathers on their bodies and red faces and throats. Two other finch species, Gouldian and owl finches, share their habitat at the zoo. All three are native to Australia and surrounding islands.
    Finches are an extremely diverse group of seed-eating songbirds. They have specialized vocal organs that allow them to sing elaborate songs. They are also known for their perching style. Their arrangement of three toes pointing forward and one pointing back allows them to easily grip tree branches.
    The Prospect Park Zoo’s finch flock can be found in the Hall of Animals building where dwarf mongoose, meerkats, turtles, and many other animals live.
