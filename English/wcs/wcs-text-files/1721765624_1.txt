						Alexandria, VA, Dec. 6, 2019 -- The Student Government Association at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a Governor’s school located in Alexandria, Virginia, has donated $12,500 to the Wildlife Conservation Society. During the school’s homecoming, the students at the school traditionally donate to a nonprofit and this year they picked the Wildlife Conservation Society, a global wildlife conservation organization, based at the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Pictured here from left to right: Dr. Kathy Phillips, Geosystems Teacher, Student Government Association (SGA) co-sponsor; Tommy Park, SGA Vice President; Sean Nguyen, SGA Treasurer; Turner Bumbary, SGA Secretary; Ronith Ranjan, SGA President; and Kelly Keenan Aylward WCS Washington Office Director.  Ms. Keenan Aylward visited the school recently to thank the students and to emphasize our appreciation to them for raising awareness about the importance of saving wildlife and wild places around the globe. Said Sean Nguyen, Student Government Association Treasurer at the school:  “This year, as a school, we decided to select the Wildlife Conservation Society as the nonprofit to receive our charitable support during our homecoming activities. By protecting wildlife through conserving natural space and educating individuals on the value of science and nature, biodiversity is able to thrive in healthy lands and seas. As students of one of the nation’s premier STEM magnet schools, we connected with this message, and wanted to help bring awareness to wildlife conservation.”
