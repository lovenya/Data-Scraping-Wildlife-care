NEW YORK – Feb 9, 2015 – Valentine’s Day is fast approaching and there is one last minute gift that will last forever. WCS’s Bronx Zoo has brought back the Name-a-Roach – a light-hearted way to make sure your loved one knows your feelings will last a lifetime.
The original Name-a-Roach launched in 2011 and thousands of hopeless romantics from around the world have named real live Madagascar hissing cockroaches at WCS’s Bronx Zoo after their favorite loved one, “ex,” or mother-in-law. The zoo is again offering the opportunity to name a new crop of cockroaches for Valentine’s Day 2015. Each gift comes with a colorful certificate emailed to your loved one announcing that a cockroach has been named in his or her honor.
Visit www.bronxzoo.com/roach to place an order. Each name costs $10 and all proceeds will go to help the Wildlife Conservation Society save wildlife and wild places around the world. 
The zoo has plenty of roaches to name with thousands of the super-sized bugs on exhibit in Madagascar!—an award-winning habitat for lemurs, crocodiles, and many other species from the African island nation.
Madagascar hissing cockroaches are the world’s largest roach species reaching nearly four-inches long.  The namesake hissing noise is emitted as a defense mechanism.  Like nearly every roach species, Madagascar hissing cockroaches are not considered pests and rarely enter homes.
