						“Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act” was introduced by Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) Bipartisan bill could act as a companion bill to House-passed Global Anti-Poaching Act WASHINGTON (December 10, 2015) – WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) applauded the introduction of the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act in the U.S. Senate. The legislation is led by Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and would bolster wildlife trafficking law enforcement and increase support for wildlife rangers. The following statement was released by John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs and Director of the 96 Elephants campaign: “The very survival of elephants, rhinos, tigers and other iconic species is threatened by wildlife trafficking. Poaching and trafficking operations are growing in scale and sophistication, with much of the billions of dollars generated financing extremist groups and criminal syndicates. We need to address this crisis now, before it is too late. “WCS supports this bipartisan legislation as a good step toward stopping the illegal wildlife trade. The U.S. can play an important role in stopping this serious transnational crime, and we applaud this bipartisan effort, led by Senators Coons and Flake. It can ensure that the U.S. government is able to assist foreign governments that truly want to tackle this crisis. The bill will help to professionalize wildlife enforcement units in key countries, while also helping to ensure that U.S. foreign assistance is targeted where it will truly make a difference.  “The American people have spoken loudly on this issue, based on the hundreds of thousands of letters sent to Congress through the 96 Elephants campaign, that this should be a priority for both political parties. “I applaud the bill’s sponsors for moving on this issue and urge the Senate to take swift action on the legislation.”   ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
