The vaccination site at the New York Aquarium is a part of the city’s efforts to incentivize New Yorkers to get vaccinated. The Pfizer vaccine will be administered at this site; all New Yorkers ages 12+ are eligible, and those ages 12-17 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Eligible participants can walk or drive into the aquarium’s parking lot on Surf Avenue. The vaccination site is located in the lot. Guests will be allowed to park in the lot for free while they get the vaccine. No appointment will be necessary. “We now have vaccination sites up and running at both the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium in partnership with the city. As part of the city’s vaccination incentive program, we will provide everyone who receives their vaccination at these sites a free ticket to come back and enjoy the zoo or aquarium another day,” said Jim Breheny, Director of the Bronx Zoo and WCS Executive Vice President of Zoos and Aquarium. “We are pleased to be able to help provide convenient vaccination options for our neighbors and the communities we serve. We are all in this together, and together we will defeat COVID-19.” Similar to the site at the Bronx Zoo, all individuals receiving a vaccine at the New York Aquarium will be given a complimentary ticket for a future visit. Ticket dates are pre-determined by the New York Aquarium and cannot be exchanged for a different day. Due to park capacity considerations, the courtesy ticket issued upon vaccination will be for a future visit date. To get a vaccine at the aquarium, guests can walk-in or schedule an appointment by visiting NYC Vaccine Finder and selecting the New York Aquarium vaccination site or by calling 877-VAX-4NYC (877-829-4692).
