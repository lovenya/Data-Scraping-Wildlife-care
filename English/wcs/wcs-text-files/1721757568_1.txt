    FLUSHING, NY, July 16, 2009 -- The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo is happy to announce the arrival of three beautiful pronghorn antelope fawns, born recently at the zoo. The pronghorn is the second-fastest land animal in the world, and the animal is unique in that it is the lone member of the family, Antilocapridae. Pronghorns are true American natives that do not occur naturally in the wild anywhere else in the world.    Get a rare glimpse as the fawns are hand-fed a nutrient-rich formula by zookeepers during a special public feeding at their exhibit, July 16 at 10:15 a.m. This is also the first time they will be introduced to the public. The animals must be fed by their keepers to get them used to humans at an early age. They will also be taking their beginning steps within their exhibit, dashing off in quick sprints that show just how fast they can go!    A species known for taking long trips in the wild, they are the second fastest land animal, beat out only by the cheetah. Unfortunately they can’t outrun the development occurring on western lands that is quickly destroying some areas of their natural habitat. WCS is currently working to protect migratory corridors in the western U.S. so that pronghorns can continue to travel over great open spaces as they have done for eons.    
Experts will be available to discuss pronghorns, the new fawns and pronghorn conservation in the wild.
