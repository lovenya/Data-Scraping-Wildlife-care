Bronx, NY – May 17, 2010 – The Belmont Business Improvement District (BBID), which fosters economic development and cultural tourism for the property owners, merchants, and residents of the famous Belmont area in the Bronx, plans to celebrate the new lion cubs of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo.
 
The BBID is offering three $100 "Great Taste of Tradition" gift cards in a drawing in connection to the city-wide effort to name the cubs.
 
“We know these lion cubs are the Pride of New York, but they especially bring out our Bronx  Pride,” said Frank Franz, Chairman of the BBID.  “All of New York is joining in on this fun, so we plan on adding to the celebration.”
 
Added BBID Executive Director, Roberto Ragone, “By including the prospect of culinary delights, those participating in the naming will exclaim: ‘Lions, and cubbies, and fare – oh my!’”
 
Anyone who votes for the names of the cubs at www.bronxzoo.com this week will be a part of the drawing. The voting started Sunday, May 16. The WCS Bronx Zoo will randomly draw three names of participants who voted at its website. Those three individuals will receive the gift cards. They can be redeemed at participating businesses in The Belmont BID by calling 917-923-4765..
