						The WCS New York Aquarium will celebrate World Oceans Day (Saturday, June 8th) with a “March for the Ocean” on the Coney Island Boardwalk to bring attention to the threat of plastic waste to the world’s marine environments. Participants will join in the fun by decorating wagons, designing “trashion” costumes, and creating signs. The parade will start at Steeplechase Plaza and march down the boardwalk to the Aquarium’s Oceanside Grill, where attendees will hear from community and environmental leaders who are working to make New York City and its local waters a healthier place to live and play.
