Everyone at WCS is shocked and deeply saddened by the loss of conservationist Wayne Lotter in Tanzania.  He devoted his life to conservation, especially of elephants, and his tragic death is a reminder of the challengers faced by so many.  His steadfast committment to reducing the poaching threat were known by many, and had great impact.  His support for local communities was a hallmark of his conservation career. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his family and friends, and the PAMs Foundation that he led and co-founded. Africa conservation has lost a champion.
