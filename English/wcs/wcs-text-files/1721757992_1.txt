These baby degus are one month old. Degus are native to South America and live in large groups called colonies. They are found in rock outcroppings and are highly social and very active. Visitors to the Mouse House can see degu babies in different stages from infants to adolescents, as there are many new mothers this time of year.



The Bronx Zoo's baby degus are one of many attractions planned for spring. The Bronx Zoo will be kicking off the season with Animal Tales Extravaganza; every weekend in April, May and June will be packed with family-oriented entertainment.
