						(New York – February 28, 2017) – It’s animal overload as Animal Planet sets up a flock of Facebook Live video segments and partners with 18 accredited AZA (Association of Zoo and Aquariums) zoos and aquariums across the country, for ‘Inside The Zoo.’ For the first time on Animal Planet’s social page, viewers will get up-close access to a variety of species, land and sea. The swarm of live streaming begins Thursday, March 2 at 9AM ET and will run for 10 hours of content.  From meerkats, monkeys and manatees, to bird shows, shark dives and sea turtle feedings, there will be no shortage of wild kingdom wonders on the digital screen. Animal care professionals and experts will be interacting with the animals and answering viewer questions, while discussing the mission and priority of all AZA zoos and aquariums – conservation of species in the wild. Throughout the Facebook Live, viewers will get sneak peeks at upcoming episodes of Animal Planet’s new series, THE ZOO, which takes audiences on a first-ever, in-depth look at the Bronx Zoo. The New York zoological park will be featured during the virtual event, highlighting the cast members of the show – giving viewers even more behind-the-scenes looks at its mission to save wildlife.
