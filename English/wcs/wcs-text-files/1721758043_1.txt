Wednesday, April 14, 2010   Free Lecture and Reception Sheds Light on the Importance of Protecting Wildlife Health to Protect Human Health 
 New York, N.Y. – Protecting the health of wildlife is a growing challenge to conservation. Outbreaks of infectious diseases often occur at the interface between people, domestic animals and wildlife. Because globalization and wildlife trade increases the threat of new health crises, human and animal health is inextricably linked.   WCS’s global health experts work around the world to develop collaborative approaches that address the complexities of caring for wildlife while protecting people and their livelihoods. In “Wildlife Conservation and Human Health,” a panel of eminent conservationists will share how they combat health threats in Asia, Africa, and right here in New York City.   The lecture is free and open to the public. Please register by April 5 at wcs.org/osbornlecture.
