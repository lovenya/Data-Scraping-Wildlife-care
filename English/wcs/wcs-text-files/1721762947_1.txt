PHOTO CREDIT: Steve Zack 9.)    American Eels: Adult eels make heroic migrations from rivers to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to spawn once and die.  Once the young hatch, they must ride the currents on their own across half an ocean to coastal rivers where they will grow up over the next 20-30 years.

Royally impressive.
