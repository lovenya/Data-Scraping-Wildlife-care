Bronx Zoo Erth Dinosaur Show April 2014.mov 

 Bronx, NY – April 17, 2014 – Attached photo and video: Erth's Dinosaur Zoo is performing at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo Wednesday, April 16 through Sunday, April 20. Show times are 11:30am, 1:30 and 3:30pm daily on Astor Court.

 Spectators will take a tour through the prehistoric world and meet an eye-popping array of lifelike  creatures in a fun and interactive setting.  Erth's Dinosaur Zoo’s skilled puppeteers use performance skills,  sophisticated design and electronics to bring the larger-than-life prehistoric giants to life on stage.

 In keeping with the dinosaur theme, Dinosaur Safari: Mysteries Revealed continues through Sunday Nov. 2 at the Bronx Zoo. 

 The narrated ride, powered by Chevrolet’s all-new and redesigned 2015 Suburban and 2015 Tahoe, will take adventurers through a two-acre area of the zoo past more than 30 fully-animatronic dinosaurs as they move, snarl, and roar. The entire experience is designed to provide an understanding about how fossils and artifacts are meaningful clues to the mysteries of the past. Tour guides engage with zoo-goers and help them discover how fossils provide insight into what life may have looked like in prehistoric times. 

 At the end of the experience, there is a field site that includes a fossil dig for children; a Tyrannosaurus rex photo-op; a paleontologist’s tent that includes a fossil museum; and an interactive robotic dinosaur that illustrates how the animatronics work.

 Chevrolet’s all-new, redesigned 2015 Suburban and 2015 Tahoe are the Official Vehicles of Dinosaur Safari at WCS’s Bronx Zoo.
