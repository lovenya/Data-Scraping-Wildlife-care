Elephants just gained a supernatural supporter – Ian Somerhalder, best known for his otherworldly role on the TV drama The Vampire Diaries. WCS applauds the American actor for his testimony on behalf of elephant conservation before a Congressional subcommittee at today’s federal hearing on the U.S. Ivory Ban. 



His efforts, both as an individual and through the Ian Somerhalder Foundation, to save elephants and other charismatic species strengthen the fight to protect the world’s wildlife. 



As part of today’s testimony, Somerhalder said, “There’s really only one word that can describe the situation of elephants in the wild today; they are in crisis. The characteristics that make elephants so iconic around the world – their beauty, majesty, and power – are precisely what make them so desirable to poachers.”
