New York, NY – February 14, 2011 – Gus and Ida, the polar bears at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo, love to cuddle and play like youngsters. 

 

Gus and Ida have been at WCS’s Central Park Zoo since 1988 making them the oldest couple at the zoo. 

 

WCS landscape ecologists have worked with polar bear researchers from the United States Geological Service to create a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) map of the changes in sea ice habitat over time. The map will help scientists distinguish climate phenomena from global warming trends that threaten Arctic wildlife.
