John Robinson, who is the current WCS Chief Conservation Officer and Executive Vice President for Conservation and Science, will continue at the organization in a part-time role focused on science and policy. WCS President and CEO Cristián Samper said: “Our Global Conservation Program has grown significantly in scale and impact during the past 30 years under John’s leadership. John is recognized in the conservation community as a preeminent authority on conservation, ensuring that conservation is defined by scientific knowledge, partnerships, sound policies, and the empowerment of local talent and communities. I am pleased John will continue his service to WCS and help us to scale up our impact. “Joe Walston has worked at WCS for 20 years in a number of roles, including country director for Cambodia and Gabon, regional director for Asia, and as Senior Vice President for field conservation for the last four years. He has been instrumental in developing many of our global conservation programs and strategies that have guided our work for the past decade. His demonstrated leadership and management skills make me confident and excited for our future.” ###
