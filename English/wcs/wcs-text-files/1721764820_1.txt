						Bronx Zoo, March 22, 2018 – Mert, an aged domestic goose at the Bronx Zoo, was euthanized on Monday due to complications from a tumor first diagnosed in 2016. 
 Mert was hatched at the Bronx Zoo 29 years ago and lived in the Children’s Zoo. He was featured on Animal Planet’s THE ZOO, a docu-series about the Bronx Zoo. His oversized presence led People magazine to call him the “King of New York’s Bronx Zoo.”  During the filming of the first season of THE ZOO, Mert was diagnosed with an inoperable mass in his abdomen. Despite this, he continued to enjoy his life wandering the Children’s Zoo and interacting with keepers and delighting guests.
 Jim Breheny, Director of the Bronx Zoo and EVP of WCS Zoos and Aquarium, said: “Mert lived a really long life in our Children’s Zoo bringing smiles to our staff for nearly three decades. Guests would come to the zoo specifically to see Mert. 
 “Recently, Mert’s quality of life began to deteriorate and we made the decision to euthanize him. We will miss seeing Mert waddling around as if he owned the place; and in reality, he owned the hearts of millions.”
