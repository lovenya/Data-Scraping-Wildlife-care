The two young male foxes came to Prospect Park from WCS’s Bronx Zoo. They are the first fennecs to be exhibited at the Prospect Park Zoo. Like many other fox species, fennec foxes are nocturnal. They are the world’s smallest species of fox, with adults typically weighing less than four pounds and having a body length that ranges from 9 to 16 inches.  Their characteristically large ears can be up to six inches long. In addition to aiding in their ability to hear prey even when it is underground, they use their ears to help regulate body temperature by dispersing heat. Fennec foxes are native to the deserts of northern Africa, where they range widely across their sandy environments. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the wild population is stable. The new fennec fox exhibit is located in the Prospect Park Zoo’s Hall of Animals building that also houses saki and titi monkeys, dwarf mongooses, and a variety of frogs and reptiles.
