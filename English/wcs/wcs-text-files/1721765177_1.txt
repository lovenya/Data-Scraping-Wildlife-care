						Registration is now open for the 11th annual WCS Run for the Wild 5K run/walk. The spring event is scheduled for Saturday, April 27 at the Bronx Zoo and is dedicated to saving wildlife and wild places. Runners, walkers, and wildlife supporters are invited to participate and/or support a participant. Early bird registration discount is available through January 31. Individuals and teams can register online at www.WCSRunfortheWild.com. Each year, the WCS Run for the Wild raises awareness of the threats facing wildlife while fundraising to help WCS conservation work at the Bronx Zoo and around the world. This year’s inspiration is giraffes, a species classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to their plummeting numbers in their native African range. Since its inception in 2009, more than more than 50,000 people have participated in the Run for the Wild at the Bronx Zoo. The 5k race for individual runners will begin at 8:00 a.m.; casual runners and walkers can take part in the Family Fun Run/Walk at 8:45 a.m. More than 5,000 runners and walkers are expected to participate. All are welcome to stay after the race to take part in post-run activities and visit the Bronx Zoo. For more information, registration, or to sponsor a runner or team, visit www.WCSRunfortheWild.com.
