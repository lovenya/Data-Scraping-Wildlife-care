Sibu, a male babirusa at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo, spends a warm spring day in his exhibit at Zoo Center after taking a refreshing mud bath. These pigs live in tropical rainforests on only a few Indonesian Islands. Only male babirusas have long, backward curving upper tusks, but both sexes have lower tusks. Visitors to WCS’s Bronx Zoo can see Sibu on exhibit all summer, and more babirusas can be seen by taking the Wild Asia monorail which opens for the season on Saturday, May 1.

 

WCS's Bronx Zoo has officially kicked off the summer with Animal Tales Extravaganza; every weekend in April, May, and June will be packed with family-oriented entertainment including readings by notable children’s book authors and live musical performances. And don't miss the second annual Run for the Wild on Saturday, April 24th at WCS's Bronx Zoo.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world’s largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony.
