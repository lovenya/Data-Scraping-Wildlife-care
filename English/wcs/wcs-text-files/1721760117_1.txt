Together with the Intertribal Buffalo Council and National Bison Association, WCS has launched a campaign to make the American bison our national mammal. The campaign begins in concert with the introduction of the National Bison Legacy Act in the U.S. Senate.

Introduced by U.S. Sens. Michael Enzi (R-WY) and Tim Johnson (D-SD), the bill acknowledges efforts of Native Americans, bison producers, conservationists, sportsmen, educators and other partners to recognize bison for their cultural, economical and ecological significance across the American landscape. Sens. Enzi and Johnson introduced the legislation at the request of a coalition of bison producers, tribal representatives and conservationists that plan to celebrate the first Thursday of each November as National Bison Day.
