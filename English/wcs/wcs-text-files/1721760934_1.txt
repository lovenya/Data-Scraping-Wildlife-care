Prospect Park Zoo Hosts Annual Fleece Festival: Saturday and Sunday, May 18 – 19, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
		
 
Brooklyn, N.Y. - April 15, 2013 – Two babydoll lambs at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo play in their pasture as mother, Ginger, watches closely. 
 
Also known as the miniature Southdown, babydolls are the oldest known purebred sheep in the world. The brother and sister pair was born last month. The male, Arthur, weighed eight pounds at birth while his sister, Brooklyn, weighed six pounds.  Both healthy youngsters are gaining weight daily. As adults, Arthur will weigh approximately 175 pounds and Brooklyn 120 pounds. 
 
Both Arthur and Brooklyn have delicate features, a diminutive size, and downy coats of pure white. 
 
The new lambs are a sure indicator that spring has arrived; and during spring the sheep at the Prospect Park Zoo get sheared during Fleece Festival, taking place Saturday and Sunday, May 18 and 19, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
 
The highlight of the event is watching the zoo’s fluffy sheep get shorn in their barnyard quarters. Shearing occurs both days at 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. 
 
Other activities planned for this year’s event, include spring-themed crafts, games and live music performed by the Otter Brothers. Visitors will get to see how felt is made during special demonstrations by the zoo’s docents.
