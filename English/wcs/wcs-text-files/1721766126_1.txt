Sightings of large whales and dolphins have become increasingly common in the New York Bight, including in and around the Upper and Lower New York Bay. In order to better understand seasonal presence and habitat-use of cetaceans and levels of ocean noise in these nearshore waters, WCS deployed acoustic recorders over a two-year period in this highly urbanized area. Melinda Rekdahl and Howard Rosenbaum of WCS's Ocean Giants Program will discuss some of their findings at the Hudson River Foundation's Edward A. Ames Seminar on Monday, December 7th from 2-3:30 pm ET. They will discuss the implications for conservation of cetaceans in the Upper and Lower Bay, as well as in the context of current and emerging issues in the wider New York Bight.
