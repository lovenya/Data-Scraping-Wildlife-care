Now California joins New York and New Jersey as leaders in taking a stand for elephants by banning the sale of ivory.  “We commend not only Governor Brown, but also Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins and Senator Ricardo Lara for championing the bill. And we thank the public and our fellow bill sponsors The Humane Society of the United States, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oakland Zoo and California Association of Zoos and Aquariums for their tireless efforts to support AB96.” “Now, California will play a direct role in saving elephants from the ravages of the illegal wildlife trade. The ivory issue is not something that’s only happening half a world away – there is a major ivory market right here in the U.S., and California was among its largest consumers.  “The goal of 96 Elephants – named after the number of elephants gunned down each day in Africa by poachers – is to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand.  Banning the sale of ivory is a key step forward to ensure a future for elephants.” ### Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.

 WCS is leading global efforts to save Africa’s elephants and end the current poaching and ivory trafficking crisis. In 2013, WCS launched its 96 Elephants campaign to bring together world citizens, partners, thought leaders, and change makers to leverage collective influence to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand. The campaign, which has partners from around the world including 125 U.S. zoos, focuses on: securing effective moratoria on sales of ivory; bolstering elephant protection; and educating the public about the link between ivory consumption and the elephant poaching crisis. www.96elephants.org
