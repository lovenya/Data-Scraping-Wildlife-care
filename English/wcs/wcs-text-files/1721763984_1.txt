						New York (November 23, 2016) – Researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) were recently surprised to discover a pair of hippos in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo – and took the first-known images of these huge beasts in this world-class protected area.  Park ranger Christian Molango managed to capture the pics during a patrol along the banks of the Ndoki River.  Rangers have been recently equipped with waterproof 12MP cameras, primarily to assist with evidence collection from poaching incidents.  The photos are a testament to the rich biodiversity of the region, where mysteries of the wild from undescribed plants to uncontacted chimpanzee communities and secret forest clearings lie undisturbed, but vulnerable. They highlight the importance of protecting this unique place.   ###
