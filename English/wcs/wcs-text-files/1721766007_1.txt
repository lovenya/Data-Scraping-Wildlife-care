						Bronx, NY – Sept. 11, 2020 – Summer may be coming to a close, but the Bronx Zoo’s BOO at the ZOO is back. The Halloween-themed event is a family favorite for New Yorkers and a tradition that marks the beginning of fall with seasonal activities for all ages. Boo at the Zoo begins Thursday, October 1 and will welcome Halloween revelers each Thursday through Sunday until November 1 (including Monday, October 12). Activities will include traditional favorites such as daily magic and mind reading shows, professional pumpkin carving demos and displays, and the spooky extinct animal graveyard. Animal-themed costumed stilt walkers and Halloween animal puppets will headline the MASKerade, and the Wildlife Theater will perform throughout each day on Astor Court.  While celebrating the season, the events and activities have been adjusted to ensure all safety guidelines as directed by the State of New York. All guests over 3 years old are required to socially distance and face coverings, and all tickets are date-specific and must be purchased in advance online. For a full list of COVID-19 protocols, visit the zoo’s Know Before You Go page. Tickets for Boo at the Zoo are now available online.
