						Today at the Bronx Zoo, members of the New York City Ballet treated zoo-goers to two socially-distant Earth Day performances on the zoo’s historic Astor Court lawn. With these dancers and musicians unable to perform as normal through the course of the pandemic, the Bronx Zoo played host to appropriately themed performances of “Carnival of the Animals” by Saint-Saens featuring musicians and dancers of the New York City Ballet, in addition to encores of “Flight of the Bumble Bee” and “Tunis Nefta.”
