The new Children’s Zoo maintains the nostalgia from the past while creating new experiences and introducing a variety of different species to the exhibit.”Species new to the Children’s Zoo include giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), Linne’s Two- toed Sloth (Choloepus didactylus), South American coatimundi (Nasua nasua) and the world’s smallest deer: the pudu (Pudu puda). Other wildlife favorites returning to the children’s zoo include American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), and South American squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) which now live on an island habitat surrounded by wading Caribbean flamingoes (Phoenicopterus ruber) and other dabbing waterfowl.The exhibit improvements are substantial, but maintain the walk-through trail experience and key features such as the aviary, prairie dog tunnels, bird nests, turtle shells, and tree house slide that have become iconic and a source of nostalgia for many.WCS worked with author/ artist Brendan Wenzel on the new whimsically illustrated interpretive graphics that identify species, provide key facts about the animals, and educate about the species’ conservation needs in the wild.Canon has generously sponsored the transformation of the Children’s Zoo, including the enhanced animal exhibits, colorful updated graphics, and innovative play experiences.For more information about the Bronx Zoo’s new Children’s Zoo or the grand re-opening events, visit www.BronxZoo.com.#NYisWILD: The re-opening of the Children’s Zoo also falls during WCS’s celebration of the 120th anniversary of its founding.
