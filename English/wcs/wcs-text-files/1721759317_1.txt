 NEW YORK (June 6, 2011) – The Wildlife Conservation Society and other partners are currently exploring a remote coral reef off Fiji’s Totoya Island.  Expedition leader, Stacey Jupiter of WCS’s Marine Program is available for live on-board interviews to discuss what the expedition team is finding – from spectacular fluorescent corals that glow like disco balls, to reef predators like giant trevally that are nearly as big as the divers themselves.



 The reef had been declared sacred for generations, but was recently opened for fishing.  However, the current high chief of Totoya, Roko Sau (Roko Josefa Cinavilakeba), who is part of the expedition team, will once again declare their sacred reef tabu for World Ocean’s Day on June 8 to ensure that there are fish for future generations.  Other partners include Pacific Blue Foundation, Wetlands International-Oceania, and the Waitt Institute.



 The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide.  We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo.  Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony.  WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
