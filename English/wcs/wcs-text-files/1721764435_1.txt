Special thanks to Emerald Equipment Systems for donating the crusher. Up to 96 elephants are killed each day in Africa due to ivory poaching, which threatens elephants with extinction. The ivory was seized from individuals and companies illegally selling it in New York. Over 650 ivory pieces were seized with an estimated value of over $6 million. Statewide ivory bans have been passed in New York, California, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington. A federal ivory ban was enacted last year. Since 1989, 22 countries and territories have destroyed more than 270 metric tons of confiscated ivory.  In 2015, Over a ton of ivory was crushed in Times Square. Despite local successes and progress in some countries, tens of thousands of elephants are still being killed illegally every year in Africa for their ivory, with about 20,000 killed in 2015 alone; this rate of illegal killing is known to be driving serious declines in elephant populations, and far more needs to be done. ###
