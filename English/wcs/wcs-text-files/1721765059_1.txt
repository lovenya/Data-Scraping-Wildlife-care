						WCS President and CEO Dr. Cristián Samper issued the following statement on the announcement of more than $185 million in new support from Michael Bloomberg and Ray Dalio’s OceanX to increase ocean exploration and protection at the Our Ocean Conference:  “The Our Ocean Conference provides a crucial forum for raising concern about the plight of the world’s marine realm and exploring ways we can protect this vast but limited source of biodiversity and sustenance. We are especially thankful to Ray Dalio and Michael Bloomberg for their new collaborative partnership for the conservation of the world’s oceans.  WCS is excited to be a partner of Bloomberg Philanthropies “Vibrant Oceans” coral reef initiative to protect a portfolio of reefs most likely to endure warming ocean temperatures.  “Protecting the health and vitality of coral reefs, among the most biodiverse habitats on earth, is crucial to conserving the earth’s marine biodiversity. Over the next four years, WCS will leverage its scientific and conservation expertise to conserve coral reefs in nine sites in the coastal waters of Fiji, Indonesia, and Tanzania, hardy ecosystems that were chosen because their reefs exhibit a resilience to increasing sea surface temperatures due to climate change. At the same time, WCS will work with communities and national authorities in these and other countries to strengthen monitoring, governance and build effective policies for managing coral reefs over the long term. “Crucial to saving the world’s coral reefs will be successful partnerships with local community residents who rely on marine resources for health and well-being. WCS will continue to work with local partners to identify and reduce threats to reefs while maintaining livelihood options and food security for coastal towns and villages. By taking action at both regional and local levels, we can help preserve the ocean as an irreplaceable natural legacy for future generations.”
