New campaign for United for Wildlife harnesses the power of sport and social media to raise awareness of wildlife crime.
Andy Murray will support the campaign as he defends his Wimbledon title.
Campaign asks this generation to decide #WhoseSideAreYouOn - the side of critically endangered species or the criminals who kill them for money?
United for Wildlife is also supported by David Beckham, Lewis Hamilton, Rahul Dravid, Francois Pienaar and Yao Ming.
These ambassadors have pledged to raise awareness about the illegal wildlife trade by supporting #WhoseSideAreYouOn at sporting events and on social media.

Andy Murray has been working with United for Wildlife since February this year and will show his support by wearing the United for Wildlife logo on his sleeve throughout the Wimbledon Championships.

The Duke of Cambridge, President of United for Wildlife, launched the #WhoseSideAreYouOn campaign on 9th June.  The campaign aims to harness the power of sport and social media to ask this generation whose side they are on: the side of illegal killing or the side of species preservation. At the launch on the 9th of June The Duke said: 

“The illegal wildlife trade thrives because it is hidden, often invisible – making it easy for criminals to build and expand their violent greed.  We wanted to find a way to show the world what was happening.  Our plea is this: join us, and be on our side – add your voice online and be a part of United for Wildife.”

The #WhoseSideAreYouOn campaign calls for people to show their support by signing up via Facebook, Twitter or Google+, subscribing to United for Wildlife You Tube channel or visiting the website www.unitedforwildlife.org to find out more. They can highlight the conservation issue by watching or participating in United for Wildlife sports events. 

United for Wildlife, which launched in September last year, was created by the Royal Foundation, led by The Duke of Cambridge, to bring together the world’s leading wildlife charities under a common purpose; to scale up the response to conservation crises and to create a global movement for change.
