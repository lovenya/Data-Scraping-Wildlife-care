Each year the WCS Run for the Wild is dedicated to an animal or family of animals in need of conservation support to raise awareness of threats they face. This year’s event is dedicated to hornbills and will help raise important funds to further its mission of saving wildlife in New York and around the world. Runners, walkers, and wildlife supporters are invited to participate and/or make a donation to support a participating runner or team. Each participant is encouraged to seek donations and there are prizes for achieving the fundraising goals. 

There is a $35 minimum fundraising requirement (plus registration) for all participants 16 years of age and older. Registration fees are $55 for adults and $45 for children and seniors. There is a $15 discount for members. Those who prefer to participate virtually, virtual run registration is $35.

Individual and team participants can register for the 5k run or 3k walk at WCSRunForTheWild.org. Everyone planning to attend are encouraged to visit the Know Before You Go page for specific safety protocols. This page may be updated according to changing guidance by NYC, NY State, and the CDC.

All runners and walkers are encouraged to stay at the Bronx Zoo for the day and take part in post-run activities. Visit the resident wildlife in all of the Bronx Zoo exhibits including the several species of hornbills in the World of Birds building.

There are more than 60 species of hornbills in the world. Like many bird species, they are threatened by habitat loss, deforestation, and other human activities.
