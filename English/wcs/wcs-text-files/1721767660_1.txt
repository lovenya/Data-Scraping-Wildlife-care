						BRONX, NY, April 27, 2024 — The WCS Run for the Wild, sponsored by Montefiore Einstein, marking the official start of spring/summer in New York City, returned to the Bronx Zoo today for the 16th year. More than 80,000 runners and walkers have traversed through the park for this event since it started in 2009.

Five thousand participants ran, jogged, and walked through the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo in support of wildlife conservation. Each year, the WCS Run for the Wild is dedicated to an animal to raise awareness of the threats they face. This year, the event was dedicated to snow leopards, which are classified as “Vulnerable” by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN). WCS and the Bronx Zoo have long been a global leader in snow leopard conservation, thanks in part to funds raised during the annual WCS Run For The Wild. 

Winners of the 5K race today were:

First place in male category: Zac Carazzone from Mahwah, NJ

First place in female category: Eliana Greenwald, New York, NY

After the run, participants enjoyed visiting the wildlife and exploring the grounds at the zoo. Post-run activities included music, costumed characters, Wildlife Theater, trivia, games, face painting, and more, and visits to the resident wildlife at all of the Bronx Zoo exhibits.

This year's run was extra special as we're celebrating 125 years of the Bronx Zoo. To celebrate after the run, participants explored Animal Chronicles, a walking trail of more than a quarter mile, featuring immersive eco-sculptures that showcase key achievements in the Bronx Zoo’s history of saving animal species and connecting visitors from around the world to wildlife. 

WCS Run For The Wild is sponsored by Montefiore Einstein.
