Three adorable crested-wood partridge chicks hatched recently at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo. Zookeepers say the young birds have adjusted very well to their home in the zoo’s Tropic Zone and are still being tended to by their parents. The zoo now boasts a total of five crested-wood partridges. This forest-dwelling avian species is native to regions of Southeastern Asia. 

 

The zoo’s Tropic Zone is a magnificent rain forest habitat where zoo-goers can encounter a variety of beautiful free-flying exotic birds, including Victoria crown pigeons, scarlet ibises, and many more. It is also home to several mammalian species such as lemurs, marmosets and fruit bats.
