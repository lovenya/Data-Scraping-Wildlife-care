						WASHINGTON (June 23, 2016) – WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) applauds Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Reps. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan (I-MP) and Ed Royce (R-CA) for their  introduction of the Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act of 2016. This legislation represents the need to reduce the U.S.’s contribution to the collapse of shark and ray populations around the world. The following statement was released by John F. Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs: “A quarter of all shark and ray species are threatened with extinction due to overfishing, uncontrolled trade and a high global demand for shark and ray meat, fins, liver oil and other products. We need to address this crisis now, before this globally important group of animals vanishes from our oceans. “WCS applauds Sen. Booker and his fellow bill sponsors for shedding a light on the plight of sharks and rays. The introduction of this bill is an important step toward addressing one of the key threats to these species globally. We look forward to continue building on this legislation to ensure that we address the broad array of threats faced by sharks and rays. As one of the world’s top ten shark and ray fishing and trading countries, the U.S. must strengthen its leadership in improving the management of shark and ray populations globally.” ###
