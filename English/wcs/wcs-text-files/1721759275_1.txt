Brooklyn, NY-May 12, 2011- The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo announces the 17th year of Fleece Fest where the zoo’s five sheep will loose their winter coats for summer, local artisans demonstrate wool working, and the Otter Brothers play toe-tapping country music.

 

After a long winter, the sheep are ready to get their thick, wooly coats sheared off. Shearing expert Don Kading will explain the process and answer visitor questions before giving them their annual haircut. The art of felt making and finger knitting will demonstrate how wool goes from the sheep to the sweater.

 

“Fleece Fest is a great time for visitors to come to the zoo and see how sheep are sheared,” said Denise McClean, Director of WCS’s Prospect Park Zoo. “The artisans are fascinating to watch and the music makes the whole barn area very lively.”

 

This year the Otter Brothers will play music for the barnyard hoe-down.  Zoo goers can also make sheep-themed arts and crafts in the Animals in Art area.
