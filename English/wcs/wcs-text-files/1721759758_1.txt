Flushing, N.Y. – January 4, 2011 – A piece of the American southwest comes north as the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo welcomes a pair of majestic Texas longhorn cattle. 
 
The Queens Zoo recently added an 8-month-old, 150-pound male calf and his mother, a 7-year old, 800-pound cow. These animals were brought to the zoo, which is dedicated to wildlife of North and South America, because they are signature of the American southwest region. 
 
“As a zoo of the Americas, it is particularly nice for us to exhibit a breed of cattle that have been developed and made famous within the United States,” said Scott Silver, Director and Curator of the Queens Zoo. “Texas longhorns add diversity to our farm area where we showcase domestic breeds of animals that live in the Americas.”
 
The Texas longhorns will share space with Scottish highlanders, another breed of cattle. 
 
Texas longhorns are a domestic breed of cattle known for their characteristic horns that can extend up to five feet, tip to tip. The breed developed originally as a result of cross breeding between feral and domestic cattle. The Texas longhorn is an animal that has long been known for its beauty, stature, and intelligence.
