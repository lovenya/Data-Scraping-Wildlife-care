						The following statement was issued by John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs:  “WCS applauds New York State Assemblyman Steve Englebright, Chair of the Environmental Conservation Committee, for his introduction of A. 6600, a bill that will protect vulnerable species.  “Building on the success of the New York State ivory trade ban, A. 6600 allows the Commissioner of the Dept. of Environmental Conservation to take swift action in banning the commercial sale of species in New York State once they are deemed ‘vulnerable’ by the state based on credible scientific evidence and presence of a market in New York.  ”This strong piece of legislation also takes a pivotal first step of designating giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) as vulnerable species. In a related global effort, WCS encourages the U.S. Government and other governments to support the proposal before CITES to include the giraffe on the CITES Appendices, thereby helping to ensure that any trade is legal and sustainable.”
