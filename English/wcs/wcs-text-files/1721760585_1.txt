				The following statement was issued by Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President of Zoos and Aquarium, Bronx Zoo Director:
		
		Last evening, we restored power and life support systems to the last remaining exhibits at the New York Aquarium. Assuming we can maintain this generator power, we have no immediate plans to relocate any animals. 
		Since power went down during the storm and the ocean surged past the Coney Island Boardwalk, we have been working to pump out water from electrical and mechanical areas. The salt water from the surge caused extensive damage to this equipment, making the restoration effort more difficult
		The aquarium staff has done an extraordinary job staying at the aquarium to care for the animals. The animal and veterinary staff provided all the necessary care to the fish, invertebrates and mammals as we worked to restore systems and power to the 14-acre facility. The dedication of the aquarium staff, led by Director Jon Dohlin, is a testament to their commitment to the animals.
		We have received an outpouring of support during this past week which brought hardship across our city and region. We thank everyone who has sent us assistance and encouragement. We have a long way to go toward assessing the damages and doing what we need to do to reopen the aquarium.
