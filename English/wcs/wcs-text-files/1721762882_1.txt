						WCS’s to start planning for new archive space to preserve rich history as a leader in conservation science, animal care, and exhibitry Bronx, NY – Aug. 10, 2015 – The WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) has been awarded a $40,000 planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections grant program to develop the WCS Archives Conceptual Preservation Design Plan. Founded upon preservation strategies that balance effectiveness, cost, and environmental impact, the Conceptual Preservation Design Plan will serve as a crucial first step in WCS’s development of a new space to preserve its unique historical collections.  “We are grateful to the National Endowment of the Humanities for recognizing the importance of preserving the documents and artifacts held in the WCS archives,” said Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and General Director of WCS Zoos and Aquarium. “Dating back to its founding as the New York Zoological Society in 1895, WCS has a rich history and has been a leader in conservation, science, and animal care for 120 years. WCS continues to be a global leader in modern conservation science and leads the evolution of zoos and aquariums into conservation-based organizations.” WCS’s archival collection covers subjects including zoo and aquarium administration; the care, treatment, and exhibition of animals; the practice of conservation fieldwork; and animals in art and architecture. These important records are a valued resource for those interested not only in WCS’s history but also in the histories of wildlife conservation, zoos and aquariums, and New York City culture. By convening an interdisciplinary team of skilled professionals to work collaboratively on the Conceptual Preservation Design Plan, the WCS Archives Department will develop the foundation to guide the sustainable protection of the physical collection and the continued study and enjoyment of these unique artifacts by future generations.
