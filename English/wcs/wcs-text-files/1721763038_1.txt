The testimony will be presented by Christina Manto, WCS Manager of Government and Community Affairs, before the Joint Committee on the Judiciary of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. WCS’s 96 Elephants campaign (named for the number of elephants killed each day in Africa by poachers) is focused on stopping the killing, stopping the trafficking, and stopping the demand for ivory. “As one of the world’s most lucrative criminal activities, the illegal wildlife trade ranks fourth globally in terms of value, behind the trafficking in drugs, people, and arms. In­creasing consumer demand for and markets in carved or worked ivory, particularly in Asia, but also in other parts of the world in­cluding the U.S., are causing the price of ivory to skyrocket, thereby driving the illegal trade in elephant ivory and the mass killings of elephants in Africa. “A major challenge to halting the ivory trade and thereby the slaughter of elephants is the lack of effective law enforcement controls along the trade chain from Africa, through the transit countries, and to the end consumer markets. “While the new U.S. federal ivory ban makes it illegal to import, export and trade ivory between states with some exceptions, the need for state level bans remains to stop the trade at the point of retail sale within states. In 2014, both New York and New Jersey passed bans on the sale of ivory.  Most recently, Governor Brown of California signed AB 96 into law, similarly banning sales of ivory in the state of California. “Through H. 1275, Massachusetts has the opportunity to help shut down this illegal trade locally and lead the way during this critical time for elephants. Other key consumer countries are watching closely. States need to take action now if we hope to save elephants for future generations. ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
