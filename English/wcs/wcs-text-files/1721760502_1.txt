On October 4, 2012, the Bronx Zoo cut ribbon on two incredible facilities: the new LaMattina Wildlife Ambassador Center and the expanded Wildlife Health Center. 
These facilities support WCS's mission to connect people to nature, with the LaMattina Wildlife Ambassador Center housing animals that are used in the Bronx Zoo's education programs. At the expanded health center, animals entering the Bronx Zoo can undergo health examinations in a state of the art space.
Speaking about these buildings, WCS President and CEO Dr. Cristián Samper said, “The LaMattina Wildlife Ambassador Center will play a vital role in WCS’s educational priorities; housing the animals we use in our education program and providing people the opportunity to experience animals up-close as they learn about wildlife and the threats they face around the world. The expanded Wildlife Health Center will enable us to continue the tradition of providing the highest level of medical support for animals in our care. We thank our supporters for making these facilities a reality.”
