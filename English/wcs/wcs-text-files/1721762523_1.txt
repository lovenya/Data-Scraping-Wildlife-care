Included photos:

#8916: Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus): The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States. Once on the brink of extinction, the species has made a tremendous recovery thanks to conservation efforts. 

#8810: Snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus): This is one of the largest owl species. Its white plumage allows easy camouflage in the snow. 

#9104: American bison (Bison bison): This is North America’s largest mammal. There were fewer than 1000 bison left in the American West when The New York Zoological Society, now the Wildlife Conservation Society, sent 15 bison from the Bronx Zoo to Oklahoma’s Wichita Mountains Wildlife Preserve to help restore the western Plains’ depleted bison population.

#9127: Coyote (Canis latrans): The Queens Zoo’s added five coyote pups last year after they were rescued by wildlife officials in Massachusetts.

#8874: Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis): These beautiful predators are found in forests throughout Canada and Alaska and are twice the size of a standard house cat.
