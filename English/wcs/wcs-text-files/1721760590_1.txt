For more than 25 years, the Conservation Leadership Programme has fostered and trained wildlife conservation professionals. A new call for young activists promises awards to early-career conservationists with less than five years of experience in the conservation arena.   Previous CLP award winners could receive as much as $50,000 in funds; a number of first-time applicants will be granted $15,000 to support initiatives. Winners of Future Conservationist Awards will have the opportunity to implement high-priority conservation projects that will develop their careers and contribute to global conservation efforts.To learn more about these opportunities and their eligibility, read our press release>>
