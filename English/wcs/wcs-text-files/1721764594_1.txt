“The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is grateful to receive funds from the recent enforcement action against an antiques dealer selling illegal ivory in New York City. We commend the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. for keeping up the pressure against wildlife crime and protecting elephants by closing down ivory markets. The poaching crisis is far from over, but working together we can safeguard elephants for future generations.”  ###
