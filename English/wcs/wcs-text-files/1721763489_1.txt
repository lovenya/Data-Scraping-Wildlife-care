JungleWorld is an award-winning exhibit featuring a number of Asian jungle habitats that highlight the biodiversity found in the jungles of Asia. For the 2016 season, an impressive colony of Rodrigues fruit bats have been added to the Matschie’s tree kangaroo exhibit to enhance the immersive jungle experience. Rodrigues fruit bats, also known as Rodrigues flying foxes, are classified as “Critically Endangered” by the International Congress for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are found only on the island of Rodrigues in the western Indian Ocean. The species roosts in forested areas and feeds on a variety of fruits. They are threatened by deforestation which leads to loss of habitat and food. Just across the path from the bats and tree kangaroos, a pair of Asian small-clawed otters welcomed a pup born this spring. Like all otters, the species is well adapted for a semi-aquatic life. Their elongated bodies and webbed feet make it easy for them to propel through the water. They have dexterous paws that aid in finding and consuming food, and their fur is extremely dense and waterproof for temperature regulation. Asian small-clawed otters have a vast but shrinking Southeast Asian range that spans from India to the Philippines, Taiwan and parts of southern China. The species is classified as “Vulnerable” by IUCN and are threatened by habitat loss and exploitation. WCS works throughout Asia and in more than 60 countries and all of the world’s oceans to save wildlife and wild places.###
