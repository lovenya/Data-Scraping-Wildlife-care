						WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) released today its favorite images of 2018.Ten of the images come from WCS’s Bronx Zoo (with one from the New York Aquarium), and ten images are from WCS’s Global Conservation Programs taken by WCS scientists working around the world. WCS operates five wildlife parks in New York City (Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, and Queens Zoo) and works in nearly 60 countries and across the world's ocean saving wildlife and wild places.
CAPTIONS and credits for included Bronx Zoo images: #1853 – TURKMENIAN MARKHOR A herd of markhor (Capra falconeri heptneri), including adult males, females, and several juveniles born this year, are running together across their exhibit. This herd lives in a rocky habitat in the wild and along the Wild Asia Monorail at the Bronx Zoo.

PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #2671 – CHINESE CROCODILE LIZARDS  A group of juvenile Chinese crocodile lizards (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) hatched earlier this year at the Bronx Zoo. The species are on exhibit in the Reptile House. PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #2765 – HUDSON CANYON’S EDGE; OCEAN WONDERS: SHARKS!  This shot is obviously not the Bronx Zoo, but WCS opened the long-awaited Ocean Wonder’s: Sharks! exhibit at the New York Aquarium during summer 2018. This photo shows the massive size of the Hudson Canyon’s Edge exhibit which is a recreation of a vital ecosystem and its inhabitants found in the waters off the coast of New York City. PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #5529 – GAUR Gaur (Bos gaurus) are the world’s largest species of wild cattle and are native to India and areas of Southeast Asia. At the Bronx Zoo, gaur can be seen grazing from the Wild Asia Monorail. This photo shows two adults. PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #6286 – MANDRILL The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) troop in the Bronx Zoo’s Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit got some attention this year for a new baby. This shot is a close-up of the adult male that sired this year’s baby. The males of the species are much larger and more colorful than the females. PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #7208 – SNOW LEOPARD A snow leopard’s (Panthera uncia) beautiful white spotted coat helps it blend into the rocks and trees within its environment. This shot of a snow leopard at the Bronx Zoo’s Himalayan Highlands is a good example of how that camouflage works. PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #7994 – SLOW LORIS  The slow loris (Nycticebus) is a small nocturnal primate native to Southeast Asia. Their huge eyes are adapted to help them see in dark of night. This slow loris can be seen in JungleWorld if you let your eyes adjust to the dark. PHOTO CREDIT: Julie Larsen Maher © WCS #8357 – GELADA The Bronx Zoo is the only zoo in North America breeding geladas (Theropithecus gelada). There have been several offspring born in recent years making for a very active scene in the zoo’s Baboon Reserve. The geladas share the exhibit with rock hyrax and Nubian ibex. PHOTO CREDIT: Megan Maher © WCS #8448 – BURROWING OWL  Burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) came to the Bronx Zoo from the Queens Zoo in 2017. In 2018, they have already hatched several offspring. The tiny owl species uses burrows created by prairie dogs and other animals to nest and avoid predators.

Bats are suspected to be asymptomatic reservoirs Ebola, which threatens human health, and is linked to massive declines in populations of western lowland gorillas in Congo and Gabon. WCS is looking for a way to prevent Ebola outbreaks and help conserve these bats for future generations.

No, it’s Fisher’s caecilian (Boulengarula fischeri), a worm-like amphibian that is only found in Cyamudongo in Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda, and a species that could possibly go extinct in the next century due to climate change according to a WCS study released in early 2018.  PHOTO CREDIT: Fabio Pupin  OTHERWORLDLY A pink river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) is one of several charismatic species that will benefit from the creation of the Baixo Rio Branco-Jauaperi Extractive Reserve created last July in Brazil. PHOTO CREDIT: Carlos Durigan/WCS  TWO TRUNKS ARE BETTER THAN ONE WCS conservationists working in Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park have not one but two good reasons to be hopeful for the park’s savanna elephant (Loxodonta Africana) population: a pair of rare twin calves were born last April.  PHOTO CREDIT: WCS Tanzania Program NEW TO SCIENCE A whiptail lizard (genus Kentropyx) one of 124 species potentially new to science discovered during the two-and-a-half-year Identidad Madidi Expedition where WCS and Bolivian scientists visited 15 Remote Sites in Bolivia’s Madidi National Park.

This has led to the fledging of 6,806 birds, like these black necked storks (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus).  PHOTO CREDIT: Phann Sithan HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KINGO In June, WCS celebrated the birthday of “Kingo” a silverback Western lowland gorilla (gorilla gorilla gorilla) estimated to be 40 years old and living in Nouabale Ndoki National Park, a protected area WCS helps manage in the Republic of Congo.

Charcoal has toxin-binding properties that may provide medicinal value. Charcoal can also serve as a laxative, thereby doubling its utility for animals that consume it after forest fires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns.
