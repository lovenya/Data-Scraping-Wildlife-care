WCS’s New York Aquarium recently welcomed Mitik—an orphaned walrus calf discovered by fisherman off the coast of Alaska. The behemoth baby, who already clocks in at 236 pounds, has garnered fans from around the world.    When he first began receiving human care at the Alaska SeaLife Center in July, caregivers worried that Mitik might not survive. The wee walrus suffered from a bladder infection, an elevated white blood cell count, and dehydration. Now under constant care from the staff at the Aquarium, Mitik seems to be responding well to medications, and he’s gaining as much as half a pound each day.   Speaking about his condition, Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium said, “Our veterinarians report to us daily on Mitik's condition. We anticipate each health report of Mitik with hope and concern."   To continue reading about Mitik’s arrival to the New York Aquarium, read this article by The New York Times>>
