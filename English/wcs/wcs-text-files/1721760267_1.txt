To kick-off the new Wi-Fi offering, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Queens Zoo are hosting a month-long photo contest.** Visitors can take photos of their favorite animals at the Queens Zoo and submit them for a chance to win a family membership to WCS wildlife parks.

The deadline for submissions is Tuesday, July 31.        “So often, our visitors are amazed by the animals they see here at the Queens Zoo and want to learn more about them,” said Dr. Scott Silver, Director and Curator of Animals at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo. “Our mission is to connect people to wildlife. Free Wi-Fi allows us to enhance that connection.”   Said John Calvelli, Executive Director of Public Affairs at the Wildlife Conservation Society, “We are very happy to partner with the New York City Parks Department and AT&T on this initiative, which will enhance the experience of our guests by allowing them to learn more about the animals in our collections and WCS’s conservation efforts in real time.”    “AT&T is always looking for new ways to connect people around New York and help them enjoy all that the city has to offer,” said Marissa Shorenstein, President, AT&T New York. “Through this collaboration, we are able to offer zoo visitors a truly interactive and shared experience – from learning about the animals to connecting with their friends and family.”   "The five-year agreement with the City of New York and AT&T is helping park-goers across the city make the most of their experience and we're excited to add the Queens Zoo to the growing list of locations where free Wi-Fi is now available,” said Bob Garafola, Deputy Commissioner, New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. “This service helps create a virtual visitors center where guests can learn more about the zoo and its inhabitants while sharing their memories as they happen."    This initiative is part of a five-year joint effort between AT&T and the City of New York to provide free Wi-Fi service at 26 locations in 20 New York City parks across all five boroughs. Since the initiative launched last June, parks visitors have made more than 2.7 million total connections, averaging 10,000 connections a day across the five boroughs.   *AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.   ** Visit official contest rules  ###   The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide.
