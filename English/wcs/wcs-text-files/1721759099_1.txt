A group from the American Jewish-Italian Jewish High School Youth Exchange Program, which includes Jewish students from Rome and from the U.S., stand in front of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo’s historic Fountain Circle during a visit to the zoo on Tuesday, March 15, 2011. The recently restored fountain once stood in Como, Italy. The group represents a joint effort between the World Jewish Congress, Jewish Community of Italy, the American Rabbinate, and the Italian Foreign Ministry of New York. The group was chaperoned by Rabbi Jay H. Rosenbaum, D.D, who is the Secretary General of the North American Boards of Rabbis. Wildlife Conservation Society Executive President for Public Affairs John Calvelli hosted the group during their visit to the Bronx Zoo.
