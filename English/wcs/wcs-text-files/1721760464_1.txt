A year ago, postal stamps began featuring the furry face of an Amur tiger cub. Save Vanishing Species stamps have been on sale for one year, and in that brief period of time, 14.9 million stamps have been sold, generating $1.58 million for wildlife conservation that helps to conserve elephants, rhinos, apes, tigers, marine turtles and many more species of animal. 
With captivating graphics, these tokens allow the public to easily contribute to global conservation. When it launched, Herb Raffaele, Chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Division of International Conservation said, "A commitment to the stamp will demonstrate that Americans really care about wildlife conservation abroad.”
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun distributing funds to groups like WCS, but despite its success, this unique initiative may fall by the wayside. To ensure its longevity, WCS urges Congress to reauthorize the program for four additional years.
Speaking about its long-term potential, John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs, said, "We have seen the way that the stamp has galvanized support for conservation among the American people over the past year. I urge Congress to keep the momentum going on this fiscally responsible funding source for the world’s most iconic species by reauthorizing the stamp for another four years.”
