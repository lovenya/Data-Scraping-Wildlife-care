In a historic collaboration announced at the Clinton Global Initiative, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Nature Conservancy, and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis have joined to form SNAP (Science for Nature and People).  SNAP will aim to solve the world’s most crucial conservation and human development issues, working with multidisciplinary teams and local knowledge. 

SNAP is designed to find practical ways nature conservation can help provide food, water, energy, and security to humankind. By combining expertise, the many organizations, scientists, policymakers, and practitioners involved will tackle high-profile problems that have actionable solutions. SNAP will also draw on local knowledge from scientists and specialists around the world, and invite them to propose strategies and solutions to urgent problems that occur at the intersection of nature and human well-being. 

SNAP will benefit all people, creating an immediate appeal and relevance to everyone from politicians to average citizens. With the combined resources and manpower behind the collaboration, SNAP will be the go-to place to find solutions relating to human beings and wildlife.
