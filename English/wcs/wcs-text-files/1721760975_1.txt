Trio of mulefoot hogs are the three not-so-little pigs at the Queens Zoo 

		

		Flushing, N.Y. – May 8, 2013 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo is now home to a trio of mulefoot hogs (Sus scrofa domesticus), a breed of domestic pig that is classified as critically rare by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. 
 
The mulefoot is different from other pig breeds in that they have single non-cloven hooves that resemble those of a mule, as its name implies. They are rare because they are no longer commonly bred by farmers.
 
The three mulefoot hogs at the Queens Zoo are all females and have course black coats typical of the breed. They can be seen on the zoo’s farm.
