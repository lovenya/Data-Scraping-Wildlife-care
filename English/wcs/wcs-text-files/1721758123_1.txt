U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services celebrated the 40th anniversary of Earth Day by welcoming 60 new citizens during a naturalization ceremony at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo.  The new citizens range in age from 77 to three years old and originate from 19 countries, including Belize, China, Ethiopia and Israel.

 

USCIS New York District Director Andrea Quarantillo administered the Oath of Allegiance to the new citizens and John Calvelli, Executive Vice President of Public Affairs of the Wildlife Conservation Society, delivered welcoming remarks. 

 

The event is part of a series of naturalization ceremonies throughout the United States the week of April 19-23 embracing the theme "Our Land, Our Country, Our Earth."
