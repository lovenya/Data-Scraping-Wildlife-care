Flushing, N.Y. - Oct. X, 2011
– ATTACHED PHOTO: Two hyacinth macaws add a splash of
color to the aviary at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo. Although
the famed aviary will remain open all winter, these macaws and the other tropical
birds will be taken off exhibit when the weather gets cold. The Queens Zoo invites
everyone to visit these colorful birds and their all-season co-inhabitants
including egrets, bobwhite quail, and many species of exotic ducks. 



The hyacinth
macaw is a parrot native to central and eastern South America. It is a
threatened species due to habitat loss and the trapping of wild birds for the
pet trade. WCS works around the world and in the Hyacinth macaw’s native South
American range to save wildlife and wild places.
