The traditional s’more is of course made of chocolate and marshmallow sandwiched between two graham crackers, but there are an infinite number of ways to elevate the sweet snack. The zoo is calling for people to submit their gourmet s’more recipes at BronxZoo.com until November 20 when Holiday Lights officially opens to the public. Gourmet versions of the classic snack can be submitted online for a chance to win tickets to Holiday Lights. The three most creative, tasty, s’mores recipes will also be chosen as a featured s’more which will be available for Holiday Lights revelers to purchase for one week each. Submit a recipe and a photo, share on social media using #SmoreToLove, and show the world how you s’more! The Bronx Zoo’s Holiday Lights, a family-favorite holiday light experience, will open to the public on November 20 and run on select dates through January 10. Tickets for Holiday Lights must be purchased in advance and are now available online. This year’s experience will encompass a larger area of the zoo and be organized to accommodate social distancing. With dozens more animal lanterns than last year, the zoo has created five geographically representative lantern safaris that include species from different regions of the world. In addition to the wildlife lantern safaris and sprawling holiday illuminations, the new Luminous Garden will feature larger-than-life plants and animals unlike any other garden in New York including flowers, mushrooms, butterflies and other insects. Entertainment will include ice carving demonstrations, costumed characters, stilt walkers, souvenirs, and seasonal treats. Of course, s’mores have been so popular, the event will have 12 fire pits where people can make their own s’mores or try one of contest winners. While celebrating the holiday season, all events and activities have been modified to meet all safety guidelines as directed by the State of New York. All guests over 3 years old are required to socially distance and wear face coverings, and all tickets are date-specific and must be purchased in advance online. For a full list of COVID-19 protocols, visit the zoo’s Know Before You Go page. WCS members will receive a 40-percent discount, and members at the Conservation Supporter level will receive free admission to Holiday Lights.
