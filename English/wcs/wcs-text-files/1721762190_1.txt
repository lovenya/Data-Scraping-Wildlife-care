Six-feet tall, crammed into a cast iron sphere four feet in diameter, WCS naturalist William Beebe and engineer Otis Barton plunged more than 3,000 feet below the ocean's surface. There, they observed never-before-seen marine life in its natural habitat and radioed descriptions back to the surface. On the 80th anniversary of their historic dive, New York Aquarium Director Jon Dohlin takes us through the event and its significance.
