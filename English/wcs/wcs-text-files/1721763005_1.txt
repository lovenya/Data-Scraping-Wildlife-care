						Dr. Michale Glennon of the WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) Adirondack  Program has won the Paul Schaefer Wilderness Award.  Named after 20th century wilderness advocate Paul Schaefer, the award is the highest honor presented by Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve and was presented to Glennon at its 5th annual membership meeting. The award recognizes individuals and organizations making outstanding contributions to the conservation, stewardship and educational value of wild lands, either Park-wide or in a particular region of the Adirondack Park. As Science Director for WCS’s Adirondack Program, Michale Glennon serves a leading role in the ecological research conducted in the Adirondacks. Her research interests lie primarily at the intersection between land use management and ecological integrity, with a number of projects ranging from the impacts of low density, exurban development on wildlife to the potential changes to Adirondack lowland boreal communities resulting from climate change. Dave Gibson, Staff Partner with Adirondack Wild stated, ”Michale is someone we count on for answers, perspective, or better questions to ask, when looking to make the best decisions possible for the Adirondack Park. Her dedication to solid scientific research and ability to apply her findings to relevant issues make her an invaluable resource to the region. In addition, her courage in providing testimony to State agencies for use in land use discourse and debate sets her apart. These are traits that Paul Schaefer would greatly admire.” “We congratulate Michale for this  well-deserved award and offer thanks to Adirondack Wild for recognizing her efforts,” said Zoe Smith, WCS Adirondack Program Director. “WCS strives to produce science-based solutions to difficult questions.  Michale achieves that goal by uncovering the close links between policy and science and informing best conservation practices. We couldn’t be more proud of her, her accomplishments, and this fantastic honor." Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve is a not-for-profit, membership organization which advances New York’s “Forever Wild” legacy and Forest Preserve policies in the Adirondack and Catskill Parks, and promotes public and private land stewardship consistent with wild land values through education, advocacy and research.
