						Hosted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in partnership with I Love NY, the inaugural Cycle Adirondacks kicks off this weekend. At last count, more than 150 cyclists from 29 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces are gearing up for one of three tour options taking place from August 23-29.   The event connects cyclists directly with the Adirondack Park and Tug Hill region like never before. During the day, riders will experience a route that boasts thousands of acres of scenic vistas and wildlife habitat, 35 quaint towns, and hundreds of welcoming local residents. WCS has identified more than 50 unique points of interest that will be  interpreted by scientists and naturalists along the entire route. Well-earned “time off the saddle” can be spent exploring the local rustic towns and with host communities at evening concerts. This will be complemented by an innovative catering program from Taste NY featuring dozens of different  local meats, produce, and craft beers.  Net proceeds of Cycle Adirondacks will support WCS’s community-based conservation program which focuses on engaging directly with local leaders to advance sustainable development projects that benefit both people and wildlife. WCS is a trusted leader in the Adirondack region, providing science and support to help advance regional discussions and resolve conservation issues. Locally-based nonprofit groups and area schools throughout the region of the ride will also benefit from the event with small grants in exchange for  their involvement as volunteers. Over 200 people are pitching in to volunteer for this event.  "Cycle Adirondacks is gearing up to be an amazing event," said Zoe Smith, Director of WCS' Adirondack Program. "We are going to showcase northern New York to hundreds of people from around the country, many of whom have never visited this region before. We are also proud to promote Cycle Adirondacks as a green event. Our goal is to recycle or compost 80% of our waste during the week."  Tour Options  Option 1: The Full Ride: Days 1 through 7—A week-long event. Total mileage for the event will be 400-500 miles, depending on options, with daily route ranging from 50 to 75 miles. Daily elevation gains range from 2,700-4,500 feet.

On Wednesday evening, Day 5, bus and bike transport will be provided back to Saranac Lake. Price: $850.00  Option 3: The Easy Three: Days 5 through 7 – A good shorter-mileage option, and also an attractive choice for families.

With this option, on Wednesday, Day 4, riders and bikes will be transported from the start/finish line in Saranac Lake to Old Forge, and then finish the rest of the event.

The 2015 tour starts and ends in Saranac Lake, the office location of the WCS Adirondack Program, and includes overnight stops in Star Lake, Boonville, Camden, Old Forge and Long Lake. There will be a “layover day” in Old Forge where riders can pedal an optional route or take the day off the bike and enjoy the amenities available in the towns of Old Forge and Inlet. “Preparation for the event has gone  smoothly and everyone is excited that the time is finally here,” said Smith. “The cyclists will be treated to a top-notch event, and for those who might still be on the fence, there’s still time to register.”  Registration fees will cover infrastructure and rider services, and will also support WCS’s programs in the Adirondack region including community grants to partnering towns. WCS’s mission in the Adirondacks is to promote wildlife conservation and healthy human communities, and it has achieved this by using a community-based approach to conservation since 1994.  WCS received a marketing grant from I Love New York through the Mohawk Valley Regional Economic Development Council to help build and promote Cycle Adirondacks. By The Numbers   250,000 – Contracts (in $s) with Local and Regional Vendors 45,000 – Grants (in $s) Awarded to Community Civic Organizations 17,616 – Directly Engaged Pre-Event Social Media Audience 575 – Pounds of Locally Raised Meats and Vegetables to be Served 470 – Miles to be Pedaled 250 – Total Volunteers Involved  80 – Percent of Waste to be Recycled or Composted 64 – Community Civic Organizations Engaged 52 – Unique Points of Interest Identified to be Interpreted on the Route 43 – Participants Visiting the Region for the First Time 42 – Week-Long Volunteers to be Involved  38 – Wildlife Conservation Society Donors, Members & Staff Participating 35 – NY Communities to be Directly Touched by Event 32 – Different Media Outlets Devoting Pre-Event Content 29 – U.S. States Represented by Riders 25 – Partners, Agencies and Sponsors Engaged 23 – NY Businesses Directly Engaged  20 – Different Meals to be Served in 12 Different Locations 18 – Music and Entertainment Acts to Perform in Eight Days  12 – Wildlife Conservation Society Projects to be Highlighted 12 – Other Non-Profit Organizations Contributing 8 – NY Counties to be Traversed 2 – Canadian Provinces Represented by Riders
