An Inca tern takes flight in the Sea Bird Aviary at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo. Native to the rocky Pacific coast of South America, the Inca tern possesses distinctive, moustache-like feathers on each side of its head. Visitors to the zoo can see more than 40 Inca terns soaring over the Aviary’s cliffs and pools, which resemble the bird’s native habitat. 



WCS Bronx Zoo’s Inca terns are just one of the many attractions visitors can enjoy this spring. WCS will be kicking off the season with Animal Tales Extravaganza; every weekend in April, May and June will be packed with family-oriented entertainment.
