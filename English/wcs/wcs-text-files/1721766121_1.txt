This year’s toy drive will look a little different but it will ensure families will receive toys during the holidays. The parks will accept toys purchased in their stores by visitors. Toy donations from outside the parks cannot be accepted for everyone’s health and safety. This process will help best ensure the cleanliness of the gifts while protecting the safety of the zoo staff and recipients of the toys during these uncertain times.
