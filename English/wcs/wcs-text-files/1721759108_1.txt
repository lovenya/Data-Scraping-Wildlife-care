				 New York, NY – March 22, 2011 – The Tisch Children’s Zoo at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo has some new additions: four baby mini-Nubian goats. 

		

		
The four youngsters, which include a set of twins, were born in late February and early March. They can be seen playing in their exhibit where they climb and leap off of any surface available. 



Visitors can pet the babies and their mothers in the Tisch Children’s Zoo along with other domestic animals such as sheep, alpacas, and Othello – the only cow in Manhattan.
