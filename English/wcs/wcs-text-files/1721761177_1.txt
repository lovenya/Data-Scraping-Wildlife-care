		Bronx, NY – August 5, 2013 – Jim Breheny (@JimBreheny), Director of the Bronx Zoo and WCS Executive Vice President and General Director of the WCS Zoos and Aquarium, tweeted this glimpse of the artists from the zoo's Exhibition and Graphic Arts Department building an indoor habitat for Komodo dragons. The exhibit will open this fall in the historic Zoo Center building.
