This is Lucy’s seventh fawn.  Tufted deer are a small species of Asian deer named for the thick tuft of black hair on top of their head. They are closely related to the muntjacs, another group of small deer species exhibited at several WCS parks.  While not endangered, tufted deer populations suffer from overhunting and habitat loss in its native range which spans central China and northeastern Myanmar. WCS works in these areas to help protect and save local species and their habitats.  The new arrival lives with his family along the Prospect Park Zoo’s outdoor Discovery Trail.  Read more about the tufted deer fawn at WCS’s Wild View photo blog: http://blog.wcs.org/photo.
