						The Wildlife Conservation Society has issued a short video with WCS veterinarian, Dr. Christian Walzer, emphasizing governments need to close live animal markets that trade in wildlife. Such a market is the source of the current world outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus. Says Walzer, calling for the closure of these markets: “These markets are local but their implications are global.” The Wildlife Conservation Society is calling for governments to close live animal markets that trade in wildlife; strengthen efforts to combat trafficking of wild animals; and work to change dangerous wildlife consumption behaviors, especially in cities. Watch this short video HERE.Since the world began to become aware of the Wuhan coronavirus, WCS has issued these two statements and a primer on the outbreak: WCS: Chinese ban on the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants and over e-commerce needs to be permanent WCS Calls for Closing Live Animal Markets that Trade in Wildlife in Wake of Wuhan Coronavirus Outbreak A Q&A: The WCS Primer on the Wuhan Corinavirus
