Did you think bubble guns and power-ups were just for gamers? Now, animal lovers can join the fun and try out the zaniest tools in wildlife conservation through the Zynga Bubble Safari game. It’s all part of WCS’s first collaboration with Zynga.org.

The new game stars Bubbles the Monkey, whose life is turned upside down when poachers capture his friends. As they come to his aid, players can also help save real monkeys and fight the illegal wildlife trade by purchasing an exclusive, in-game starter pack. This bundle of in-game Safari Cash, Coins, and Power Ups comes a special discount, with 100% of the proceeds going directly to WCS for a limited time. All proceeds will further WCS’s mission to save wildlife and wild places around the globe.
