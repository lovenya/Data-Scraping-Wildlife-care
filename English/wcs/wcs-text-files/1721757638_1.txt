– WCS's Bronx Zoo partners with Bank
of America and Fisher-Price® to bring a fun-filled week of games and
challenges for visitors of all ages, August 17-23.

Fisher-Price®, a proud partner, of the Wildlife
Conservation Society has created the zoo’s very own toyland.  The
super-sized Fisher-Price® play area is filled with cool new toys like the
Handy Manny™ Manny's Repair Shop, Imaginext® Dragon World
Fortress™, and the Precious Places™ Swan Palace.
 Guests will pedal and play with Smart Cycle Extreme™ and the new
3-1-1 Smart Sports™ system, ride the new Stinger XS™ around the
Power Wheels ™ driving track, and design their own necklaces to take home
at the Color Me Gemz ™ vanity station.

Zoo guests will interact with costume characters such
as Planet Heroes characters “Ace” and “Digger” and
Little People characters “Sonya Lee” and “Eddie.”

Other activities will include storytelling with
professional storyteller LuAnn Adams, live presentations by Wildlife Theater
Players, and animal play time.
