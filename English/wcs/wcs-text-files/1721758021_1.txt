Just in time for spring, this pygmy marmoset at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo easily figures out how to retrieve one of its favorite treats- a tasty insect- from a plastic egg. Pygmy marmosets are found in South America and are one of the world’s smallest primates.  The animal keepers at WCS’s Bronx Zoo daily provide enrichment to the animals to help keep them mentally and physically active and healthy. Visitors to the Monkey House can see enrichment activities throughout the spring.

 

Animal enrichment is just one of many attractions planned for spring.  WCS’s Bronx Zoo will be kicking off the season with Animal Tales Extravaganza; every weekend in April, May, and June will be packed with family-oriented entertainment.  And don’t miss the second annual Run for the Wild on Saturday, April 24th at WCS’s Bronx Zoo.
