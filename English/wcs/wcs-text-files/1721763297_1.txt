More than 400 breeding pairs of lesser adjutant storks were recorded, while both the spot-billed pelican and Asian openbill had record breeding years in 2014 when the surveys were made. Prek Toal is considered to be the premier wetland site on Tonle Sap Great Lake, and last year was designated a RAMSAR site – an international treaty on the protection of globally important wetlands. The increase in wildlife began in the early 2000’s when bird hunters were converted to nest protection rangers. In 2012, institutional changes relating to fishing access could have led to increases in illegal activity that would have threatened wildlife. However, an increase in protective measures such as platform-based waterbird monitoring and stream protection meant that the wildlife remained and flourished. Camera trapping confirmed that both hairy-nosed and smooth-coated otter occur throughout the core area in good numbers, as a result of protection of the bird colony and dry-season streams. The greater adjutant stork population remained around 150 pairs, which although low, makes it the largest colony of this species worldwide. A range of other bird species was recorded, including the endangered masked finfoot. WCS has provided financial and technical support to the Ministry of Environment to manage Prek Toal for more than a decade. The full results of the surveys appear in a report: “Wildlife Monitoring at Prek Toal Ramsar Site, Tonle Sap Great Lake 2013-2014” by Sun Visal and Simon Mahood of WCS’s Cambodia Program. WCS’s work in this region has been supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development, Margaret A. Cargill Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
