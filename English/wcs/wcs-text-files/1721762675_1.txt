This year’s Birdathon promises to be bigger and better with prizes, keeper chats, conservation experts, family activities, and a free-flying bird show, all presented by JetBlue Airways. The second annual bird-watching event is open to birders of all skill levels, including families and novices. The Bronx Zoo is a birder’s paradise. The park sits on 265 acres of hardwood forest that is transected by the Bronx River – the only freshwater river in New York City. The diverse habitats and access to water make the zoo the perfect environment for dozens of migratory and resident bird species including warblers, vireos, thrushes, woodpeckers, ducks, wading birds, and more.  Many of these birds travel from as far away as South America and other areas of the tropics. Participants will receive a checklist of the bird species found in and around the zoo. Zoo staff will guide birders to areas of the zoo where they will most likely observe wild birds.  Interactive areas will allow participants to try out new binoculars; build their own bird feeders and nestboxes; have children dress up as their favorite birds; and talk directly to the Bronx Zoo’s ornithology staff about how they care for birds at the zoo and work to save birds in the wild. WCS bird expert David Oehler, Bronx Zoo Curator of Ornithology, will be on-hand along with the zoo’s bird keepers to chat with bird-watchers about WCS bird conservation programs, offer birding advice and answer questions. Said Oehler: “Conservation starts in your backyard.  What better way for WCS to celebrate birds and bird conservation than by allowing everyone, especially children, to see one of nature’s wonders, the multitudes of Neotropical birds as they migrate through our park, and have an opportunity to talk directly to the staff about our avian programs.” Prizes will be presented to those that are able to observe the most birds on their checklists. For more information and to register for the Bronx Zoo Birdathon, visit BronxZoo.com.  Following the Birdathon activities, participants are encouraged enjoy the rest of the day at the Bronx Zoo and stop by Astor Court where Animal Behavior & Conservation Connections (ABCC) will be flying various species of birds from around the world, during JetBlue Presents Birds in Flight. The live show will run twice a day for three weekends – 11:30am and 2pm on Saturday and Sunday, May 9/10; 16/17; 23/24. Social media-savvy Birdathon participants can share their photos of key Bronx Zoo bird-sightings with the hashtag #NYisWild as part of the 120 Ways #NYisWild campaign marking the 120th anniversary of WCS. The city-wide photo safari includes #29 white-throated bee eater; #32 owl; #35 condor; #39 flamingo; #42 penguin; #45 Inca tern; and #48 blue curacao. Visit NYisWild.com to register.
