						WCS Praises California Assembly for Passing Ivory BaAB 96 Passes with 62 ayes, 14 nays and 4 no votesBill now goes to California SenateKey to stopping elephant slaughter is to stop sale of ivoryCalifornia poised to play a direct role in saving elephants NEW YORK (June 2, 2015) – The Following statement is from John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs and Director of the 96 Elephants Campaign: “WCS [Wildlife Conservation Society] and the 96 Elephants campaign praise the California Assembly for passing AB 96, state legislation that would ban the sale of ivory and rhinoceros horn in the state of California. We commend Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins for introducing and ushering this legislation through the Assembly. The bill now goes to the California Senate. “California is a major ivory market in the U.S., and the Assembly has shown real leadership by taking on this issue. The goal of 96 Elephants – named after the number of elephants gunned down each day in Africa by poachers – is to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand. Banning the sale of ivory is a key step toward stopping the demand, and California is poised to play a direct role in saving elephants from the ravages of the illegal wildlife trade.” “WCS and 96 Elephants urge continued support of AB 96, and we look forward to working with the bill’s co-author Senator Ricardo Lara to ensure its swift passage by the California Senate, then on to Governor Brown whom we urge to sign AB 96 into law.  A special thanks to our fellow bill sponsors Humane Society of the United States, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oakland Zoo and the California Association of Zoos and Aquariums and its dedicated members for their hard work in supporting Assembly passage of AB 96.” ### Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
