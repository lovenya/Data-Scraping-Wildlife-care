						Bronx, NY – April 29, 2023 – The event that marks the official start of spring/summer in New York City – The WCS Run for the Wild – returned to the Bronx Zoo today for the 15th consecutive year. Despite the rain, thousands ran, jogged, and walked through the 265-acre zoo in support of wildlife conservation.

Since its inception in 2009, more than 70,000 have participated in the event. Each year the WCS Run for the Wild is dedicated to an animal in need of conservation support to raise awareness of threats they face. This year the event was dedicated to sloths to help WCS raise important funds to further its mission of saving wildlife in New York and around the world.

The man and woman first to finish the untimed 5k run: 


 Tyler Perry of Haverstraw, NY
 Kate Tylis of New York, NY. 


After the run, all participants were invited to stay at the Bronx Zoo to enjoy the wildlife for the rest of the day and had zoo grounds to themselves until 1pm. Post event activities included games, music, and more on the Bronx Zoo’s historic Astor Court.

WCS Run for the Wild is made possible by the generous support of:
