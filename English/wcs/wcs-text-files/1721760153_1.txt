The Piagaçu Institute has orchestrated a new model for sustainable development in the Brazilian Amazon. Local fishermen have become experts at catching discus fish, globally cultivated for their splendid colors. In the past, local communities have had to rely on middlemen to complete transactions, which precluded fair sale prices. 
Discus are providing optimism and opportunity. WCS works with the Piagaçu Institute to study biodiversity and sustainable management in the region; this collaboration led to improved methods and sales. Now selling to a Brazilian business seeking sustainably sourced fish for aquariums worldwide, local fishermen are learning to increase financial returns while improving handling and organization. To read more about sustainable fishing in the Brazilian Amazon, visit National Geographic NewsWatch.
