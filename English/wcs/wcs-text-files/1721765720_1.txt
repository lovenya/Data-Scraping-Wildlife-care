The following statement was released by the Wildlife Conservation Society:
“We are greatly saddened by the news this week that the sentences of the eight conservationists unjustly imprisoned in Iran on charges of espionage were upheld. “All eight of these Iranian women and men, Niloufar Bayani, Taher Ghadirian, Amir Hossein Khaleghi, Houman Jowkar, Sepideh Kashani, Abdolreza Kouhpayeh, Sam Rajabi, and Morad Tahbaz are respected conservation professionals who were arrested in 2018. They are innocent and worked in Iran with no malice and only with love for its wildlife. Our plea is that they be released and allowed to return to their lives, which were dedicated to respecting and protecting the natural heritage of Iran. “We call for amnesty.” ###
