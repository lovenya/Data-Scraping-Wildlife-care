School is in Session – For Piranhas, that is

 

The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo introduced 18 ferocious looking red and orange bellied piranhas in the Flooded Forest exhibit.  These South American freshwater fish hover in the water above a black and white pearl stingray who shares their tank. 

 

Piranhas have a reputation of frenzied attacks on unsuspecting prey, but in reality, they are quite docile and prefer to scavenge for food. All the fish have shimmering silver scales, and the 15 red bellied and three orange bellied piranhas can be identified by the bright coloring underneath.  The pearl ray, also a scavenger, picks up whatever is left behind after feeding time and helps to keep the tank very clean.

 

WCS works in the Amazon – home to many piranha species – to save wildlife and critical habitats.
