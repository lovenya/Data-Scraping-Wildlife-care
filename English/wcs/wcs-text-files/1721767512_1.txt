						Washington, DC, December 11, 2023—The following statement was released today by WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs John Calvelli in support of a newly introduced bill to address environmental crime in the Brazilian Amazon:

“WCS commends U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) on the bipartisan introduction of the Strengthening the Rule of Law in the Brazilian Amazon Act. U.S-Brazil cooperation to address nature crimes such as illegal logging and land-clearing, illegal fishing and wildlife trade, and illicit mining in the Brazilian Amazon will be strengthened by this bill.

“Efforts to improve governance and address environmental crimes in the Amazon must promote the rights and livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, support legal, sustainable natural resource management and economic activity, and prevent the deforestation and degradation of protected areas and other important ecosystems.”
