						On April 5, the Bronx Zoo and USDA announced that three veterinary labs confirmed that Nadia, a four-year-old Malayan tiger, tested positive for COVID-19. Nadia, who was first introduced to Animal Planet audiences as a cub on THE ZOO in 2017, had a cough and a mild loss of appetite and is expected to make a full recovery. In a special episode of THE ZOO on Saturday, Apr. 11 at 9PM ET/PT, audiences will get an update on Nadia and six other big cats showing similar symptoms at the zoo, by Bronx Zoo Chief Veterinarian Dr. Paul Calle. Dr. Calle earlier reported that the cats were infected after coming into contact with one or more asymptomatic staff members. Additionally, THE ZOO tomorrow night will feature Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny with a general Bronx Zoo update; EXTINCT OR ALIVE’s wildlife biologist, Forrest Galante providing insight on COVID-19 and how it relates to wildlife; and Dr. Jeff of DR. JEFF: ROCKY MOUNTAIN VET discusses if and how the virus affects pets. Animal Planet’s THE ZOO gives a rare behind-the-scenes look at the Bronx Zoo and in-depth stories about the staff and the incredible animals they dedicate their lives to care for and airs each Saturday at 9PM ET/PT.###
