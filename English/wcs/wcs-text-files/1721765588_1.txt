						As one of New York City’s greatest holiday traditions and for the first time since 2007, the Bronx Zoo Holiday Lights will return in 2019 during the most festive time of the year with dazzling light displays that will cover and sparkle acres of the zoo. Visitors will be able to walk-through the zoo to experience wildlife-themed LED displays, custom Asian lanterns, animated light shows on the historic Astor Court and more. “We are bringing an updated version of a beloved holiday tradition back to the Bronx Zoo for the first time since 2007,” said John F. Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. “The LED lights, animal-themed lanterns, and animated light shows will be set amongst the historic buildings on an expanded footprint that will take people throughout the zoo. The LED technology will also allow us to be incredibly energy efficient. We believe our visitors will come away really enjoying this ‘green’ holiday experience!” Visitors can celebrate the holiday season with an enchanting adventure to warm up the entire family. Festivities will include: ·         The Ice Jubilee at the Bronx Zoo Includes an Ice Bar, Ice Throne & Ice Slide (December 21 to 31) – Holiday revelers will be able to take festive photo ops on the ice throne, where ice kings and queens can take their seat on an oversized throne made completely of ice, as well as breaking out your inner penguin and slide down a 20-foot ice slide. Visitors can also grab a specialty cocktail at the zoo’s 12-foot ice bar which will be available for purchase during Holiday Lights operating hours. ·         Nightly Ice Carving Demonstrations (Ongoing) – Throughout Holiday Lights from 5 to 9 pm, professional ice carvers will debut their talents as they use chainsaws and chisels to carve holiday and animal-themed sculptures with a live audience. All finished sculptures will be on display throughout the Dancing Crane Plaza. ·         Ice Carving Competition (December 28) – On Saturday, December 28 from 6 to 9 pm, the zoo will take ice carving to the next level when five professional ice sculptures will create 20 sculptures in an elimination style “speed carving” format over a three-hour period. This format is ideal for spectators to witness carvings formed in less than 30 minutes before their eyes. The competition will be emceed by an experienced carver to entertain the crowd and provide fun facts, as well as facilitating spectator participation. Visitors can also get involved in the carving judging. The 20 new sculptures will be displayed for future viewing. ·         Carolers, Characters, Train Rides & Lantern Safari – Visitors will be able to enjoy classic and modern holiday tunes sung by Victorian-dressed live carolers throughout the zoo, as well as taking photos with some of the zoo’s seasonal characters including lions, giraffes, gorillas, penguins and a friendly snowman. Families can also take a journey “around the world” along a dedicated section of the park that will be illuminated by hand-created lantern sculptures, while also learning about the work WCS scientists are doing to help save various species. Train rides will also be available for the whole family at Astor Court. Bronx Zoo Holiday Lights is sponsored by Con Edison.
