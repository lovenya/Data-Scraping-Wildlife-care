Co-hosts Minister of State Mr. Niels Annen and WCS President & CEO Dr. Cristián Samper endorsed the Berlin Principles on One Health, which were launched at the event. Event speakers and participants warned of the dire impact on our global society if we kept ignoring the interconnected issues relevant to human, animal and environmental health – also known as the One Health approach. A few months later, the COVID-19 pandemic gave a wake-up call for the global community. The ongoing global health crisis has highlighted the close connections with non-traditional security issues, including wildlife trade for human consumption, as well as the biodiversity and climate crises. This year’s conference builds on the Berlin Principles to identify how to move forward.  ###
