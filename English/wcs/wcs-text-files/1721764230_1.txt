The first to finish the 5k run Tim Campbell from Merrick, NY who finished with a time of 17:03. The top three women and top three men finishers were: Men: Tim Campbell from Merrick, NY (17:03)  Toby Zitsman from New Rochelle, NY (17:35)  Christopher Stewart from Bronx, NY (17:53)  Women: Annmarie Charno from Seaford, NY (19:47)  Jenn Russell from White Plains, NY (20:46)  Taylor Williams from Los Angeles, CA (21:22)  Each year, WCS Run for the Wild is committed to raising awareness of the threats facing wildlife while raising money to help WCS conservation work at the Bronx Zoo and around the world. This year runners and walkers were able to choose choose to participate on behalf of whatever species most inspires them. Since its inception in 2009, more than 40,000 people have participated. After the run, everyone was invited to stay at the Bronx Zoo to enjoy the wildlife for the rest of the day. This year’s activities included a new line-up including local microbrew beer garden (age 21 and above); a rock climbing wall; and a live DJ on the Bronx Zoo’s historic Astor Court. Of course, the zoo’s marquee exhibits are all open for everyone to enjoy for the day to inspire runners and to teach participants about the conservation programs that benefit from their support. This was opening day for the Wild Asia Monorail, and exhibits like Tiger Mountain, Madagascar!, and JungleWorld are just a few others that bring people face-to-face with some of the species that they are helping to save through their participation in or support of the WCS Run for the Wild.
