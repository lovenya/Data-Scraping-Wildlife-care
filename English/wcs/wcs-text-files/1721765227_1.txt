						The Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium has been named a finalist for the 2019 National Medal for Museum and Library Service award.    The award is the nation’s highest honor given to museums and libraries by the Institute of Museum and Library Services in recognition of exceptional service to the community and for making a difference in the lives of individuals, families, and communities.  
This year’s finalists also include public libraries and library systems; a statewide digital library; art, science, and children’s museums; and many other types of institutions that exemplify the great diversity of libraries and museums across the country.   “The 30 National Medal finalists showcase the tremendous ability of libraries and museums to serve as vital community resources,” said IMLS Director Dr. Kathryn K. Matthew. “The Institute of Museum and Library Services is honored to recognize these leading institutions. We congratulate them on the work they are doing across the United States.”   “We’re honored to a finalist for this prestigious award, which validates our commitments to initiatives such as offering STEM education for all, creating comprehensive workforce development programs for youth, and connecting local residents to marine wildlife and nature, ” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the WCS New York Aquarium. “Thanks to Congressman Hakeem Jeffries for nominating us for the National Medal for Museum and Library Service and his continued support of the WCS New York Aquarium.”     National Medal winners will be announced this spring. Representatives from winning institutions will be honored for their extraordinary contributions at a ceremony on June 12 in Washington, D.C. As part of the National Medal celebration of these 30 institutions, IMLS will feature the finalists on the IMLS Facebook or Twitter pages, and provide an opportunity for you to share your story about how the WCS New York Aquarium has made a difference in your life.
