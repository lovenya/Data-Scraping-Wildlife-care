Prehistoric Creature of the Deep at the Wildlife Conservation Society's New York Aquarium. Chambered Nautilus now on exhibit. Like the coelacanth, the nautilus has remained unchanged for over 400 million years and are considered living fossils. During prehistoric times, there were about 10,000 different species of nautilus, but only a small handful are known to survive today. The nautilus is closely related to other cephalopods such as the squid, cuttlefish, and octopus. Like most cephalopods, it can use jet propulsion to reach speeds of over two knots. The life and habits of the nautilus are still largely a mystery since it spends most of its time in deep water up to 1,800 feet. Visit the New York Aquarium today and view these interesting creatures.
