Roosevelt elk weigh approximately 25 pounds at birth. Adult bulls can weigh up to 1,100 pounds and females up to 700 pounds – making them the largest of all elk subspecies. Ranging from Northern California to southern British Columbia, Roosevelt elk are one of the largest terrestrial animals in North America. They have distinct coats with a dark brown head and pale brown torso.  In stark contrast, the Queens Zoo is also home to the world’s smallest deer species, the pudu. A pudu fawn was born earlier this season. Adult pudu weigh only about 25 pounds and are native to Chile and Argentina.
