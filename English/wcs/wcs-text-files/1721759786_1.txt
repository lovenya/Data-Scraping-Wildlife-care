		Flushing, N.Y., Jan. 11, 2012 – East meets west as the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo rings in the Year of the Dragon with a special two-day celebration on Saturday and Sunday, Jan. 21 and 22 from noon to 4 p.m. 
 
Visitors will have a chance to meet a real bearded dragon along with other reptiles. Children can participate in arts and crafts where they will make a variety of reptile- and New Year’s-themed crafts while zoo staff discuss fun facts about bearded dragons and other animals of the Asian zodiac. There will also be an opportunity to sign up for the Queens Zoo’s summer camp program at an early-bird discount of 10 percent off the regular fee. 
 
As an added bonus, the first 100 children each day will receive a traditional red envelope surprise from the zoo.
