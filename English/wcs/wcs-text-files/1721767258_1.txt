						WCS’s New York Aquarium Education staff and Youth Ocean Advocates attended yesterday’s World Oceans Day event held during a general session at the United Nations. A variety of speakers, including H.E. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, focused on the theme- Planet Ocean: Tides are Changing. The event included a message from the International Space Station, Ocean X Climate Keynote, and remarks by Sylvia Earle, Explorer at Large for National Geographic and Mission Blue, and Fabian Cousteau, Founder and Chief Oceanic Explorer for Proteus Ocean Group.

In 2015 with the support of Greener NYC funding, the NYA launched the Youth Ocean Advocates program (YOA) to activate New York City youth by providing first-hand experience, training, and exploration of strategies to engage local communities in marine conservation issues. During this 9-month paid internship, students meet with WCS professionals to learn more about the work they are doing in local NYC waters and globally in over 26 countries around the world. Youth Ocean Advocates support the NY Seascape team to support wildlife conservation campaigns, learn how environmental policies impact communities and the health of the environment, and explore ways they can influence change as a young leader.
