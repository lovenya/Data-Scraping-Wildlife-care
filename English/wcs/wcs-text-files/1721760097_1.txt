Weavers and spinners work the wool to the live music of the Otter Brothers Band
 
Saturday, May 19 and Sunday, May 20 
Brooklyn, NY-May 12, 2011- The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo is hosting its 18th annual Fleece Fest celebration featuring live shearing of the zoo’s sheep and alpacas on Saturday and Sunday, May 19 and 20.
 
“This year promises to be another fun-filled event for all ages. The Prospect Park Zoo’s sheep and alpacas will be helped out of their winter coats by expert sheep shearer Don Kading. Local artisans will demonstrate wool working, and the Otter Brothers will entertain the crowd with their variety of live country music,” said Prospect Park Zoo Director Denise McClean.
 
Attendees will learn from experts about processing wool and will have an opportunity to ask questions before the animals receive their annual haircuts. Everyone will learn the art of felt making, finger knitting, and more.
