						The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) released a series of images showing hatchling Burmese roofed turtles (Batagur trivittata) – considered one of the most endangered turtles in the world. The species was believed to be extinct until WCS/TSA conservationists, along with the Myanmar Forest Department, rediscovered it in the wild in the early 2000s. Today, sandbanks used as nesting sites by females are monitored, and eggs are collected and incubated under natural conditions at a secure facility in Limpha Village, Sagaing Region, Myanmar. The offspring are “head-started” for eventual repatriation into the Chindwin River. With a captive population now approaching 1,000 turtles, the species appears in little danger of biological extinction. Complementary conservation efforts are focused on the remaining wild population, which consists of five to six adult females and perhaps as few as two males. These turtles are so poorly studied that no one had ever gotten around to describing the hatchlings until a recent study published in the journal Zootaxa.
