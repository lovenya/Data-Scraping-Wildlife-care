WCS is working in this region with Russian collaborators to close old logging roads to protect Amur tigers and their prey. The footage is a sign that these efforts may be working. ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
