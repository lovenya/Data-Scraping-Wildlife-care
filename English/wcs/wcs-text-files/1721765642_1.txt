The following statement was issued by Sara Marinello, WCS Vice President for Government & Community Affairs: "The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) applauds New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for signing into law a bill that will ban the sale within New York State of parts of any species that are classified as ‘Vulnerable.’ "We commend New York State Assemblyman Steve Englebright and Senator Monica Martinez for championing this important legislation. "With many species around the world becoming vulnerable to pressures such as over exploitation and the illegal wildlife trade, this groundbreaking bill will allow the Department of Environmental Conservation to take swift action to designate species as vulnerable and stop the sale of articles made from their parts."
