Beginning July 5 on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, Eric Carle’s World of Wildlife will bring his famous books to life with live performances, music, dancing, games, and other activities. The stunning illustrations from popular titles including The Very Hungry Caterpillar; Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?; The Very Busy Spider; and The Artist Who Painted a Blue Horse are the inspiration behind hand-crafted puppets that will headline on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. These colorful creations will be available for meet and greet/photo-opportunities after each show. The performances are interactive and each features a different story that will bring families and friends through an imaginary journey through the classic books. In addition, the Bronx Zoo’s Wildlife Theater will perform on Mondays through Thursdays during the same 8-week period. These performances and activities will connect zoo visitors with elements of nature themed from Eric Carle’s famous books. Guests will learn about the migration of the monarch butterfly; watch a theatrical reading and play games about brown bears; and sing along with performers to learn about the importance of spiders and insects. Eric Carle’s World of Wildlife, and the Bronx Zoo’s Wildlife Theater events will be timed and spread throughout the expansive Bronx Zoo grounds to ensure a fun, leisurely, and safe experience for everyone. Tickets must be purchased in advance at BronxZoo.com and are date and time specific to ensure capacity considerations and social distancing.
