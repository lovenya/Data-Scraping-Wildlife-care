						WASHINGTON (May 22, 2018) – Today, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to advance S.2764, the Sustainable Shark Fisheries and Trade Act, to the full Senate for consideration.The following statement can be attributed to WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) Executive Vice President John Calvelli:“I thank the Senate Commerce Committee, as well as Senator Rubio and the other sponsors of the bill for their leadership and bipartisanship in moving this legislation forward.  The Sustainable Shark Fisheries and Trade Act is a strong, science-based framework to conserve sharks, rays and skates on a global scale.  Sharks play a critical role in marine ecosystems as apex predators upon which the health of the oceans relies, but they need our help. I urge the full Senate to pass this important legislation.”
