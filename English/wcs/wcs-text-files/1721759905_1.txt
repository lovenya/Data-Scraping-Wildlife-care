A National Geographic production broadcast on ABC Nightline looks at a spate of tiger attacks on humans in 2009, and asks why such attacks might be happening. According to conservationists like Joe Walston, WCS Executive Director for Asia programs, hungry tigers will occasionally turn to people out of desperation, as their forest homes and prey dwindle. The pressures on Sumatran tigers have become so severe, only 400 of these top predators remain in the wild.

In the program, Walston speaks about poaching, logging, and other threats to Sumatran tigers, and what we can do to limit conflicts between humans and the big cats. He also discusses how to ensure they don’t go the way of tigers in Bali or Java—extinct.
