WCS commends council for leadership on wildlife trade issue Los Angeles is major market for ivory in U.S. Key to stopping elephant slaughter is to stop sale of ivory The 96 Elephants campaign coalition is comprised of 191 organizations in 45 states and the L.A. Zoo is the local partner  Los Angeles (April 3, 2015) – The following statement is from John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs and Director of the 96 Elephants Campaign: “WCS [Wildlife Conservation Society] and the 96 Elephants campaign praise Los Angeles City Council for unanimously (10-0) passing a resolution this week, Wednesday, April 1, in support of AB96, state legislation that would ban the sale of ivory and rhinoceros horn in the state of California. We commend Councilmember Paul Krekorians for introducing the resolution. Los Angeles is a key ivory market in the U.S. and a recent NRDC study found that up to 90 percent of ivory for sale in L.A. is likely illegal. The passage of this resolution shows the true leadership of the City Council on this issue. WCS and 96 Elephants urge continued support of AB96, and we look forward to its swift passage by the California legislature. Banning the sale of ivory is a key component to an overall strategy to save Africa’s elephants from the ravages of the illegal wildlife trade.”
