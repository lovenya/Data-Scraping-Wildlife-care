						June 22, 2015--Following the destruction of 662 kgs of confiscated ivory in Beijing on 29th May 2015, Zhao Shucong, Head of China’s State Forestry Administration, set out 10 tough measures to tackle the illegal wildlife trade and suggested that there would be strict control of ivory processing and trade until the commercial processing and sale of ivory and its products are eventually halted.  The partners in United for Wildlife – Conservation International, Fauna & Flora International, International Union for Conservation of Nature, The Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation Society, WWF-UK, the Zoological Society of London and The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry – welcome the announcement of substantial and important measures to combat the illegal wildlife trade.  In response to the speech, William Hague, Chairman of United for Wildlife’s International Taskforce on the Transport of Illegal Wildlife Products said: “The speech made by Zhao Shucong, Head of China's State Forestry Administration, is an extremely important step forward in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. The Chinese Government's announcement on wide ranging measures to combat wildlife crime, in range states and consumer countries, should give us all great hope.  The  United for Wildlife International Taskforce on the Transport  of Illegal Wildlife Products, which I chair, will do all it  can to support measures to clamp down on the trafficking  of illegal wildlife products.” United for Wildlife partners are working together to combat the illegal wildlife trade. Our joint activities will support the measures announced in Beijing by:   Ensuring that United for Wildlife’s International Taskforce on the Transport of Illegal Wildlife Products, chaired by Mr William Hague, supports effective measures to prohibit the transport and delivery of illegal wildlife and its products by enterprises engaged in the transport industry.  Continuing to work with its technology partners to combat the online illegal wildlife trade.  Continuing to provide substantial legal advice and support to improve the rule of law and law enforcement in the range countries of the African Elephant, transit countries and consumer countries through its partnership with international law firm DLA Piper.  Increasing efforts to raise awareness and understanding amongst young people of the threats of the illegal wildlife trade to species both in China and in other countries around the world.  Continuing to increase support to range countries of Elephants, Rhinoceros, Big Cats and Pangolins by improving the efficacy of protected areas and applying new technologies to combatting poaching.  United for Wildlife was created to enhance international cooperation in the fight against illegal wildlife trade and promote joint actions and measures. The statement from the Chinese Government and the set of measures announced in Beijing to combat the illegal wildlife trade is a significant step forward in building an international coalition against wildlife crime, and brings the goal to secure the long term survival of these species closer. As HRH The Duke of Cambridge, President of United for Wildlife, said during his recent visit to China: “The illegal wildlife trade is our common enemy. It is a vicious form of criminality: plundering the natural resources of poorer countries, taking lives, hindering development and spreading corruption.  Traffickers think nothing of violating laws and sovereignty anywhere they can to exploit a loophole or turn a profit. And international cooperation is our strongest defence against them. With that in mind, we must join forces”.
