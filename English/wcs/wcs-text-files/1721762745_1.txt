For 12 decades, WCS has harnessed the expertise in its zoos and aquarium in New York City with its global field conservation programs to save wildlife and wild places.    WCS recently published a decade-by-decade historical timeline detailing key milestones in its conservation history.

Additionally, one of these grand prize trips will be awarded to a professional educator to emphasize the educational importance and focus of the WCS operated zoos and aquarium.    Other prizes for participation in the 120 Ways NY is Wild photo adventure include: a WCS premium family membership to all five parks (Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, and Queens Zoo); a whale watching tour for with WCS scientists; a season pass for National Geographic Live; an opportunity to become a sea lion keeper for a day at WCS’s New York Aquarium; and a weekend getaway in the Adirondacks with WCS conservationists.    Contest rules and restrictions do apply.
