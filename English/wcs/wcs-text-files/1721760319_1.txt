Flushing, N.Y. – Aug. 13, 2012 – Two blue-throated macaws perch on a branch in the historic aviary at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo. 
 
 These parrots live in the zoo’s geodesic dome aviary among other exotic birds including scarlet macaws, blue and gold macaws, and sun conures. The blue-throated macaws can be recognized by their brightly colored blue and yellow plumage and the blue patches on their cheeks. 
 
 Not to be confused with the similar blue-and-gold macaw, the blue-throated macaw is a critically endangered bird native to Bolivia, South America. Only a small population of less than 300 remains. Its decline is due mostly to the pet trade and habitat destruction.
 
 WCS conducts field work throughout South America, including the blue-throated macaw’s native Bolivia, to save wildlife, mentor local conservation professionals, and train wildlife monitors.
