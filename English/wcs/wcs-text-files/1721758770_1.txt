New York, Nov. 16, 2010 – Franklin, a magnificent wild turkey, puffs up and fans his tail for his female companions at the WCS Prospect Park Zoo. Zoo visitors can watch Franklin strutting at the zoo's barn. 

 

An iconic Amerian bird, Benjamin Franklin once nominated the wild turkey to be America's national bird.

 

In the field, WCS’s Guatemala Program helped develop the community-based oscillated turkey conservation program in the Multiple Use area of the Maya Biosphere Reserve.
