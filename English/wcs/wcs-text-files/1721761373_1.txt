The Wildlife Conservation Society today launched an innovative online fundraising effort that will give New Yorkers an opportunity to help the New York Aquarium shimmer as it is transformed following Hurricane Sandy.

Virtual tiles of a shimmer wall, which will surround the new Ocean Wonders: Sharks! exhibit,  are being sold at www.nyaquarium.com .

Created by WCS’s design team in collaboration with award-winning environmental artist Ned Kahn, the actual wall will wrap the entire exterior of the building in 33,000 4” x 5 ½” aluminum tiles, creating an eye-catching art installation that will transform the Coney Island skyline. Powered by nature, the wall will use wind and sunlight to make it ripple like the surface of the ocean. 

Each virtual tile is available for $100 and will fund the aquarium’s transformation taking place alongside post-Sandy rebuilding efforts. The aquarium was devastated by Hurricane Sandy on Oct. 29, 2012, just days before it was to break ground for Ocean Wonders: Sharks! Surge waters flooded all buildings within the 14-acre park. Damage was significant to the aquarium’s infrastructure and life support systems.

 “The WCS New York Aquarium is important to the economy and culture in New York City,  to the education of our city’s children, and to the conservation of the New York seascape,” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium. “By purchasing a virtual tile, you will help bring back to our city a ‘new’ New York Aquarium.”
