						Bronx, New York – April 28, 2016 – The following statement was issued by John F. Calvelli, Executive Vice President of Public Affairs at WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society): “Mayor de Blasio’s executive budget for fiscal year 2017 keeps funding for the 1,500 cultural organizations throughout the five boroughs at the same level as fiscal year 2016. We urge the Mayor and City Council to recognize the importance and value of New York City Culture and increase operational support by $40 million for the coming year.  “In the City Council’s response to the preliminary budget proposal, there was a call for an increase of funding by $40 million for New York City’s cultural organizations – the same amount the city’s cultural organizations are rallying around in the “NYC Inspires” campaign. “These organizations help make New York City a cultural capital of the world. They provide all New Yorkers opportunity to learn about and experience a vast array of cultural disciplines including dance, music, art, film, history, wildlife and more that serve as inspiration in life and career. “A funding increase would be a step in the right direction and would go a long way to ensure NYC’s cultural community can provide continued, even increased, access and educational programing to the communities and neighborhoods they serve. Money spent on culture in New York City is an investment in the future of the city and its citizens in all five boroughs. “The NYC Inspires (#NYCInspires) campaign highlights cultural organizations of all kinds across the city and the means by which they have inspired their audiences. It tells the stories of individuals that were so inspired by culture as children that they have devoted their lives and careers to pursue a life that reflects those beginnings – bettering the city, their communities, and future generations of artists, musicians, performers, educators, curators, conservationists, scientists, and more. “We call on all New Yorkers to join in support of the city’s cultural organizations by visiting NYCInspires.org and sharing stories of how New York City Culture has impacted your lives.”
