Brooklyn, N.Y. – Oct. 21, 2011 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium is offering an opportunity for visitors to go behind the scenes of some of the most exciting animal exhibits in New York. The aquarium’s education staff will guide visitors through a one-of-a-kind “Insider’s Tour” on Sunday, Nov. 6, from 10 – 11:30 a.m. Participants will get a guided tour of an off-exhibit viewing area above the shark tank and can get a bird’s-eye view of the sand-tiger, reef, and nurse sharks, swimming below. Inside the aquarium’s Alien Stingers exhibit, the tour will stop to see array of brightly colored sea jellies. 

There will be an opportunity to touch some of the marine animals including horseshoe crabs – a species that lives in the waters of New York City. Many of the animals on the tour are species that are being researched as part of the aquarium’s New York Seascape, a conservation program launched through WCS last year. 

Aquarium educators will discuss the natural history, behavior, and conservation of the animals featured throughout the tour. 

Fees are: $28 non-member adult (ages 13 and up); $19 member adult; $23 nonmember child (ages 6 – 12); $14 member child. Those who participate in the tour must be at least 6 years old. Fees include admission to the aquarium.
