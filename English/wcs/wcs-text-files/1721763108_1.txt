The tigress was photographed with cubs, now estimated to be two years old.  The fate of the cubs remains unknown. “Thailand continues to show a strong commitment to conservation and management of its protected areas.  The Western Forest Complex remains one of the largest remaining strongholds for tigers in Southeast Asia.  WCS is proud to work with the government of Thailand and provide scientific expertise. “WCS is confident that the poacher will be fully prosecuted, which will send a strong message to wildlife traffickers that Thailand takes wildlife crime extremely seriously.” In 2011, authorities in Thailand arrested and eventually prosecuted poachers who killed a tiger and took pictures of it on their cell phone.  WCS camera trap images eventually proved the tiger was killed in a protected area. ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
