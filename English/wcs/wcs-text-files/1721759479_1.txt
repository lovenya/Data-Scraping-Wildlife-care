New York, NY- August 15, 2011: Biru, a 1-year-old red panda, rests in a tree in his new home at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo. He recently joined his female companion, Amaya, in the Temperate Territory of the zoo. 

Red pandas are endangered due to habitat loss caused by deforestation for timber, fuel, and agricultural use. It is estimated that fewer than 2,500 remain in the wild. The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx, Prospect Park, and Central Park Zoos all work with the Species Survival Plan for red pandas.Contact:
