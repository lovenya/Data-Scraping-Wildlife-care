						Bronx, NY – Sept. 20, 2017 – Boo at the Zoo, one of New York City’s most cherished Halloween traditions returns to the Bronx Zoo with a new line-up of activities designed for all ages. The annual Halloween celebration will kick off Saturday, September 30 and run weekends and holidays through Sunday, October 29. A few highlights include: a Haunted Forest, Hayride, Corn Maze, Pumpkin Carving, Candy Trail, and Bootoberfest. Scheduled activities embrace the spirit of the season while incorporating wildlife. Guests will have an opportunity to meet animals often associated with Halloween folklore including, vultures, owls, and ravens. This year’s walk-through experience takes an eerie turn through a Haunted Forest. The spooky sounds, creepy crawlies, bats, spiders will keep guests on their toes as no one knows what (or who) may be lurking around the corner. The historic Astor Court will be transformed into Bootoberfest with live acoustic musical performances. Grab a bite and a beer from the Bronx Zoo food truck and play some games on the lawn. Bronx Zoo Animal Keepers will be on hand throughout the park to chat with Halloween revelers about the animals at the zoo while providing holiday-themed enrichment treats to some of the park’s residents. Other Halloween experiences include: a mentalist who will read your mind; puppet shows, and crafts. Visit www.BronxZoo.com/Boo for a complete schedule of dates, performances and activities.
