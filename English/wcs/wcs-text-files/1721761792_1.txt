Karukinka has been selected as one of the world's most "breathtaking" places in a competition organized by the European Outdoor Conservation Association (EOCA), an organization that offers funding to implement conservation projects with links to the outdoor enthusiast. 

Karukinka is currently in 3rd Place in the Alpine category of the competition, so we encourage everyone to participate in the online voting and help this project win the prize. Please encourage your friends and family to help as well. With your help, we can promote the groundbreaking work of WCS in the Southern Cone of Latin America.

The project with the most votes at the end of the 2-week voting period will win funding.

Voting will end at 12:00 (GMT) on March 31st.
