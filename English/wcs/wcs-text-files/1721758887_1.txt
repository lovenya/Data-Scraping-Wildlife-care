For a quarter century, the WCS Wildlife Health Center has provided healthcare for all
animals within WCS’s New York City parks and served as headquarters for our
wildlife health work in countries across the globe. The center’s more than 70
health specialists—including veterinarians, pathologists, and technicians—work
closely with keepers and curatorial staff to keep more than 1,700 species
healthy and happy. Throughout the world, they also monitor potential pandemics
such as avian influenza, Ebola, and SARS for the benefit of animals and humans
alike.Learn
