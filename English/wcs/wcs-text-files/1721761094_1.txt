Flushing, N.Y. – July 8, 2013 – An endangered southern pudu, (Pudu puda), the world’s smallest deer, was born at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo.  The young doe weighed 1 pound at birth; could weigh as much as 20 pounds as an adult. 
 
The fawn is still nursing but will soon transition to fresh leaves, grain, kale, carrots and hay. 
 
Pudu have extraordinary characteristics: they will bark when they sense danger and can climb fallen trees. Although small in stature, only 12 to 14 inches at the shoulder, pudu are excellent jumpers, sprinters, and climbers. What the pudu lacks in size, it makes up in strategy. When chased, pudu run in a zig-zag pattern to escape predation. 
 
Southern pudu are native to Chile and Argentina and are designated vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Using research and conservation practices, WCS is working in the pudu’s range countries to grapple with habitat loss and other threats to wildlife.
