						Bronx, NY – September 28, 2016 – One of New York City’s most cherished traditions returns this weekend with Boo at the Zoo: Thirteen Days of Halloween at WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) Bronx Zoo. Each weekend in October – including the Rosh Hashanah and Columbus Day holidays – will feature family-friendly, not-so-scary seasonal programming that combines traditional Halloween activities with the Bronx Zoo’s resident wildlife.  The annual Halloween celebration will run October 1-4, 8-10, 15-16, 22-23, 29-30.  Scheduled activities embrace the spirit of the season while incorporating wildlife and conservation. Annual favorites including the hay maze, giant pumpkin carving demos, costume parades, magic and more will return with some additional Halloween surprises. This year’s Jack O ‘Lantern Illumination, an eerie walk-through experience will feature all new animal-themed carvings that take over the exhibits in the former World of Darkness building (near Somba Village) creating a one-of-a-kind illuminated Halloween display. Entertainment will include performances from Boo at the Zoo favorites, Gigi and the Lend Me a Hand Band and magician David Levitan. Bronx Zoo Animal Keepers will be on hand throughout the park to chat with Halloween revelers about the animals at the zoo while providing holiday-themed enrichment treats to some of the park’s residents.
