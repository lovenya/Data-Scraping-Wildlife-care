						New York, NY--April 3, 2023--Just in time for the spring bird migration, Roundtable and the Bronx Zoo are flocking together to give birders and the bird curious something to chirp about - a new class featuring conservation educators.

The two-part, online course Birds of a Feather: Avian Evolution begins on April 15th (10 am-12 pm, $60); it will explore bird evolution and bird diversity through engaging discussions, activities and presentations from instructors Max Falkenberg and Ileana Rivera, conservation educators at the Bronx Zoo. 

The course follows the evolution of birds to the modern era, and it will include virtual Bronx Zoo exhibit visits. Participants will learn about the origins of birds in the Mesozoic Era and their evolutionary relationships to the other (non-avian) dinosaurs that roamed the planet during that time period. They will also learn about the adaptations birds made to become a successful group of vertebrates - as well as the diversity of modern birds, including penguins and peacocks.

“Birds are so easy to fall in love with, said Falkeberg. "They’re all around us, all the time, so I hope I can help people see a bit of what I see in our feathered neighbors. It's really an honor to be featured by Roundtable."

Roundtable by The 92nd Street Y, New York is an online learning platform featuring live online courses and Q&A sessions with some of the greatest minds of our time: world-renowned historians and scholars, Pulitzer Prize-winning writers, political pundits and acclaimed food and wine experts, among others. All courses include interactive opportunities with instructors.
