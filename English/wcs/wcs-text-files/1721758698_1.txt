New York, N.Y.- Oct. 24, 2010  – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s wildlife parks – Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, and New York Aquarium – have announced that fall/winter hours will go into effect starting Monday, Nov. 1, 2010. Each of the five WCS wildlife parks will now be open 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., daily. 

 

Although the days are shorter, there is still plenty to see at each park. The animals enjoy the brisk weather and the zoos in New York City are the perfect place to watch the foliage change color.  

 

Each facility has a full line-up of activities and attractions to keep zoo- and aquarium-goers entertained this season:

 

WCS’s Bronx Zoo

The 265-acre Bronx Zoo is located in the heart of a hardwood forest providing fall zoo-goers the perfect opportunity to enjoy the fall foliage without ever leaving the city.  Enjoy a stroll through the woods and visit with the Bronx Zoo’s six new tiger cubs at Tiger Mountain.  On colder days, visitors can stop in JungleWorld, Madagascar!, or any one of the many indoor exhibits to warm up.  As the holidays approach, a full line-up of Wild Winterland activities through December will be sure to get everyone in the spirit of the season.

 

WCS’s Central Park Zoo

Surrounded by fall foliage with the mid-town Manhattan skyline in the background, the Central Park Zoo is a beautiful place to take an autumn stroll.  When the snow starts to fall, zoo-goers can see snow leopards and polar bears in their element, or escape the cold in the balmy Tropic Zone, home to the zoos newest residents – mountain coatimundi and mongoose.  The Central Park Zoo is celebrating the holidays with “presents to the animals” and a winter themed celebration throughout the month of December.

 

WCS’s Prospect Park Zoo

The Prospect Park Zoo’s Discovery Trail takes visitors on a walk through red, yellow, and orange trees where they can see a kangaroo, North American river otters, and red pandas.  Don’t miss the baby Hamadryas baboons, Jabari and Azizi, as they celebrate their first holiday season by unwrapping gifts at the annual “Presents to the Animals.”

 

WCS’s Queens Zoo

The Queens Zoo is completely outdoors and is the perfect place to watch the leaves turn gold and the snow dust the bare branches. The sprawling exhibits, home to animals such as bison, pronghorn, and mountain lions, provide a beautiful, scenic spot to watch the seasons change. Weekends in December the zoo holds its annual “Presents to the Animals” event.  Visitors are invited to watch the zoo’s puma and bears tear into beautifully wrapped presents to find tasty holiday treats hidden inside. 

 

WCS’s New York Aquarium

Visitors can escape the cold by heading inside the aquarium’s colorful Alien Stingers and Explore the Shore exhibits. Edith, the new California sea lion pup, will be enjoying the winter weather from the Sea Cliffs exhibit.
