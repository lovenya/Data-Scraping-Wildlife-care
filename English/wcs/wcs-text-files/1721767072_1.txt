The following statement was issued today from the Convention on Biological Diversity CoP15 by Dr. Chris Walzer, Executive Director of Wildlife Health for the Wildlife Conservation Society:

“Language on taking steps to prevent the next zoonotic spillover must be included in the final CBD CoP15 global biodiversity framework out of respect to the 6 plus million who have died of COVID-19 and the 8 billion of us who can face a similar fate if the world’s governments don’t get serious about preventing pandemics in addition to just being better prepared.

“The concepts of prevention and preparedness are not mutually exclusive. It’s not a zero sum game. World governments need to both work to prevent pandemics by focusing on upstream solutions and be prepared. Currently, it is not clear that the CBD Parties will even include a reference to health in the final framework.

“As the language is sorted and brackets are removed, governments have an opportunity to advance the One Health approach. The link between human, animal health, biodiversity and intact environments must be firmly established at the CBD COP 15 and beyond. Internationally there is a growing recognition of One Health and the importance of formally integrating the traditionally separate fields of environment and wildlife health with livestock and human health management.

“If the Parties fail to emphasize preventing pathogen spillovers, it is clear they have already forgotten the tragic toll of COVID-19 to our families and economies worldwide.”
