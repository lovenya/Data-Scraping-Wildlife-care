We're feeling especially grateful today. We've accomplished so much together on behalf of wildlife this year â€“ and we have you, our loyal supporters, to thank. We'd like to offer a personal note of gratitude to each and every one of you. But of course, no single message fits all.
...After all, some of you tend to be quite modest.

And some of you love the limelight.

Whatever your type, you are a true gift to wildlife.

And believe us, we know we ask a lot of you.

But somehow you always come through.

We accomplished an incredible amount together this year, saving wild animals and wild places all over the earth. Together, we're unstoppable.

So today, we just want to say: thank you.

Happy Holidays to you and yours. Enjoy your feast! (But please, don't hoard.) 

Sincerely,

The Wildlife Conservation Society
