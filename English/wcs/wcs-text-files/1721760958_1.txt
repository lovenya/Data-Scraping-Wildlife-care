Bronx, N.Y. – April 27, 2013 – More than 5,200 ran, jogged, and walked through the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo in support of elephant conservation at the fifth annual WCS Run for the Wild – a 5K event to raise money to save elephants, their habitats, and other wildlife. 
 
The first in the herd to cross the finish line was Birger Ohlsson of Mt. Vernon, NY who finished with a time of 15:29. The top three men and top three women finishers were:
 
Women:
Laura Wang of Manhattan (18:01)
Melissa Weiner of The Bronx (18:13)
Sarah Rodriguez of Ossining, NY (18:30)
 
Men:
Birger Ohlsson of Mt. Vernon, NY (15:29)
Diego Vanegas of Manhattan (16:16)
Jonathan Kline of Manhattan (16:44)
 
“The WCS Run for the Wild has become a favorite of New Yorkers, and many have been participating annually since the beginning,” said John F. Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. “We are excited by another tremendous turn-out of runners, walkers, families, and wildlife enthusiasts – all of which are doing their part to help save elephants and other wildlife.”
 
This year’s top fundraisers were the Gauthier/Kaufman family from Los Angeles, Calif. who raised more than $11,000 to help WCS save elephants. Michelina Gauthier, a first time WCS Run for the Wild participant, said she is heartbroken to think these majestic creatures are slaughtered to make trinkets.
 
The illegal wildlife trade is now a multi-billion dollar industry that threatens thousands of species around the world. Elephants have been particularly hard hit with 2011 considered the worst year since 1989 for the illegal poaching of elephants for their ivory.
 
Both Asian and African elephants are threatened by habitat loss and poaching. The Wildlife Conservation Society works in Africa and Asia and across the elephant’s native range to save wildlife and wild places. WCS has a proven track record of keeping elephants safe in countries across Asia and Africa and has been instrumental in many of the places where elephants thrive. Conservationists work in partnership with governments to establish parklands, enforce anti-poaching laws, and monitor and track elephant populations. The Niassa National Reserve in Mozambique, the Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bukit Barisan Seletan National Park in Indonesia, and Nagarahole National Park in India are a few of the places where WCS is working with elephants.
 
Participants who sought donations received prizes for their efforts. The prizes were awarded to those who meet various fundraising goals. For $30 in pledges, runners earned a WCS Run for the Wild T-shirt; $60 earned a Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who pop-up book; $125 earned a plush elephant; $275 earned a Jackrabbit Sports gift card ($20); $600 earned an elephant-themed tote bag; $1,500 earned a VIP breakfast and a guided ride on the Bronx Zoo’s Wild Asia Monorail; $3,000 earned a special Bronx Zoo animal experience.
