Flushing, N.Y. – Dec. 13, 2011 –
		
				 The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo will host the annual Presents to the Animals event to celebrate the holiday season. 
 
The weekends of December 17 – 18, and 24 - 25 visitors to the zoo can watch as the animals receive their festive treats. Every treat will be hidden inside beautifully wrapped gift boxes for the animals to tear into.  
 
Zoo-goers will have a chance to participate in the festivities by helping to decorate the animals’ presents. Those who arrive early can help the zoo’s animal keepers wrap boxes filled with tasty treats for the pumas, bears, and coyotes – then watch as the animals devour their delicious gifts. 
 
Schedule for Presents to the Animals:
December 17–18, and 24

                     Coyotes: 1 p.m.
                     Pumas: 2:15 p.m.
                     Andean bears: 2:45 p.m.           
 
This completely outdoor zoo is especially beautiful during the fall and winter months. The trees and shrubbery have turned vibrant shades of red, yellow and gold, and a dusting of snow would turn the zoo into a picturesque holiday scene.
