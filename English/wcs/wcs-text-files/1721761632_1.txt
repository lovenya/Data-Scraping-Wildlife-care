WCS has developed a new online tool to help New Yorkers satisfy their chronic need for more space – virtually, at least. Mannahatta2409.org will enable users to develop and share their own version of a sustainable New York City, designing a greener metropolis block by block.



Dr. Eric W. Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist at WCS, and Kim Fisher, a lead developer at WCS, built Manahatta2409.org to empower everyday visionaries and conservationists to change the city’s ecosystems, lifestyles, and climates. The program uses scientific methods, many of which have been adapted from the city’s own environmental review process, to estimate over 60 metrics of environmental performance.
