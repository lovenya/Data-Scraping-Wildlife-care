						Coney Island, NY – May 16, 2017 – The votes are in and the people have spoken! The three winning designs for the new Education Hall mural along the Coney Island Boardwalk have been chosen.    The winning designs were submitted by artists Danielle Mastrion of Brooklyn; Sheena Wong Shue of Sheepshead Bay/Coney Island; and Tom Manco, of Manhattan. Each will install their mural on the boardwalk during the week of World Oceans Day, June 8.   The winners, along with brief bios and interpretive statements from the artists, can be found at www.nyaquarium.com.    “We extend a heartfelt congratulations to the winning artists and a special thanks everyone who participated in the contest.” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium. “Each and every participating artist embraced the theme, and each design illustrated the problem of ocean plastics in a unique way. We are especially impressed with the winners and are anxiously awaiting the unveiling of the finished murals.”   A special Honorable Mention was awarded to a beautiful design submitted by the youngest artist, 10-year-old Bria Neff, who will receive a scholarship to an aquarium summer camp courtesy of the New York Aquarium Education Department.   The WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society’s) New York Aquarium asked local artists and art schools to submit designs that would raise awareness about the devastating effect of ocean plastics – the theme of this year’s World Oceans Day.  The issue of ocean plastic pollution is a growing problem. The New York Aquarium is working to inspire people to reduce the amount of plastic that makes its way to our oceans. More than eight million tons of plastic ends up in our rivers, streams and oceans, and are devastating to wildlife of all types. At the current rate, estimates indicate that the Earth’s oceans could contain more plastics than fish (by weight) by 2050.   Of the 42 designs submitted, seven finalists were chosen by a panel of judges and offered for public vote. Those judges included: Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium; Sue Chin, WCS Vice President of Planning and Design and Chief Architect; New York State Assemblywoman Pamela Harris; and Pam Pettyjohn, President of Coney Island Beautification Project.
