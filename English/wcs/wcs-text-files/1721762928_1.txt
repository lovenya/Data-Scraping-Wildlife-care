A recent study by National Geographic among likely ivory buyers in Thailand shows that 73 percent would support a government ban on all buying, selling, importing, and exporting of ivory; we urge the government of Thailand to take such action and close its domestic markets.  Clearly, there is global momentum building to save elephants from the ravages of poaching fueled by the ivory trade. “WCS and its many partners – from world leaders to park guards – will continue to work to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand, including efforts to close ivory markets, so that elephants can once again thrive without the threat from ivory trafficking criminals.” ###   Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.

 WCS is leading global efforts to save Africa’s elephants and end the current poaching and ivory trafficking crisis. In 2013, WCS launched its 96 Elephants campaign to bring together world citizens, partners, thought leaders, and change makers to leverage collective influence to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand. The campaign, which has partners from around the world including 125 U.S. zoos, focuses on: securing effective moratoria on sales of ivory; bolstering elephant protection; and educating the public about the link between ivory consumption and the elephant poaching crisis. www.96elephants.org
