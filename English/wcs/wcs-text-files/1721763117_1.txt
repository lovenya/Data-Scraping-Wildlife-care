The red pandas at the Prospect Park Zoo are a subspecies from the eastern portion of the Himalayas. The subspecies of red panda at the Bronx Zoo and Central Park Zoo (Ailurus fulgens fulgens) is found in the western part of their Himalayan range.   Red panda cubs are born with a very soft, plush light brown coat that eventually becomes morecoarse. They reach adulthood at around 18 months. Adult red pandas have reddish-brown and black coats. They have an adaptation on their wrists that acts much like a thumb and enables them to grasp food items like bamboo as well as tree branches. Red pandas are listed as “Vulnerable” by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss caused by deforestation for timber, fuel and agricultural use. Their population is declining. WCS works in China and Myanmar to save red pandas and other Asian wildlife.  For more information or to speak with a WCS expert, contact Barbara Russo at 718-265-3428 or brusso@wcs.org.
