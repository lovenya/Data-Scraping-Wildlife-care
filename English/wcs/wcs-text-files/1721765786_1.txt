						The New York Aquarium is temporarily closed as New York City deals with the COVID-19 crisis. During the closure, the animal care staff remains focused on the health and well-being of the animals – including the latest addition to the Sea Cliffs exhibit. Erie, a California sea lion pup (Zalophus californianus) born this fall, will be ready to greet visitors when the aquarium re-opens. The 5-month-old male pup was born in October, which is unusual timing for the species.   Sea lions typically give birth in late spring or early summer. The mother, Nora, came to the New York Aquarium over the summer from the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and was pregnant when she arrived. The name “Erie” was selected because Lake Erie is bordered by both New York State and Ohio. Follow Erie’s development and exploits on the aquarium’s Facebook and Instagram channels. “Erie is doing well and receiving excellent care from our keepers and veterinarians,” said New York Aquarium Director Jon Forrest Dohlin. “He is energetic and interacting well with the other sea lions. We are looking forward to his public debut.” California sea lions are the only species that are exhibited in all five WCS parks in New York City – the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, and New York Aquarium.
