– “Franklin,”
a magnificent male wild turkey, resides with his female companions at the
Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo. The wild turkey
is an American bird, originally brought to Europe
in early 16th century by Spanish conquistadors. The species was
transported to England and throughout northern Europe.
The English then brought the domestic turkeys back with them when they settled
the colonies. In 1776, in search of a national bird, Benjamin
Franklin nominated the wild turkey as a symbol because of its courage. Visitors
can see Franklin
strutting in the barn area on Thanksgiving day and the other 364 days during
the year.
				  
				In the field, the Wildlife
Conservation Society is working on turkey conservation in Guatemala
– home of the spectacular oscillated turkey, which is a close cousin to
the wild turkey.
