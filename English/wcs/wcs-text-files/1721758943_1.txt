Meet Chopin, Haydn, Handel, Purcell, and Scarlatti
		

		

		 


		
Brooklyn, NY – Jan. 5, 2011 – Five male Sebastopol geese can now be seen waddling around the barn yard at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo. 

 

This ruffled breed is of Central European origin and has a look very different than most other geese. Sebastopol geese have frilly plumage on their backs that falls in tendrils while their neck feathers are smooth.

 

Named for notable Baroque composers – Chopin, Haydn, Handel, Purcell, and Scarlatti – the five new geese are very vocal. Visitors can hear the them make their music in the barn where they reside near turkeys, alpacas, and sheep.
