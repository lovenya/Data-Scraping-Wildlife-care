Overlapping much of Guatemala's northernmost border, the Maya Biosphere Reserve is a stronghold for biodiversity. It spans a whopping 8,100 square miles. Jaguars, pumas, and howler monkeys all rely on it.

Local communities depend on it as well, utilizing its deep well of natural resources for their livelihoods. October 16 is World Food Day and this year's event is themed around family and small farmers like these. WCS is currently working closely with local communities to ensure that agricultural fires used for the production of staples like corn and beans donâ€™t damage the surrounding forest or harm wildlife.
