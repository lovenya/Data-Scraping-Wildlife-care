Bronx, NY – July 1, 2013 – Two roseate spoonbill chicks hatched at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo, pictured with their mother. The chicks, along with nine of their adult counterparts, are on exhibit in the zoo’s Aquatic Bird House. 

Roseate spoonbills have pink and white plumage, and their namesake bills are flat and spoon-shaped which help them forage for insects, plants, crustaceans, and mollusks. 

Spoonbills live in colonies in the wetlands in the Southeastern United States, Mexico, and South America. The Wildlife Conservation Society works in the spoonbill’s natural range to save wildlife and wild places.
