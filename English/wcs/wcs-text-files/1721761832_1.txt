Dr. Joel Berger, Senior Scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society’s North America Program and John J. Craighead Chair in Wildlife Biology at the University of Montana, is on a seven-plus week expedition to Wrangel Island. Located off the coast of northereastern Siberia, Berger and his Russian colleagues are braving wind-chills down to –70°F.

What could be worth enduring these extreme polar temperatures? A chance to study the Arctic's largest land mammal - the muskoxen. Traveling by foot, helicopter, and snow-machine, the scientists are gathering information on the impacts of climate change on these massive animals. The study is not only scientifically important, but is a landmark cultural exchange involving a complex array of collaborators.
