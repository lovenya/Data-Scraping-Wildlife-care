						The following statement is from Dr. John Robinson, WCS Executive Vice President for Conservation and Science, on Dr. Carlos Lopes Pereira Winning the Tusk Conservation Award – The Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa: “The Wildlife Conservation Society congratulates Dr. Carlos Lopes Pereira, who was honored with a lifetime achievement Tusk Conservation Award in Africa – the Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa – for his four decades of work to protect Mozambique’s natural heritage.  “Carlos is the embodiment of a true conservationist. As Director of Protection and Law Enforcement Services within the National Administration of Conservation Areas (ANAC) in Mozambique, he is a tireless fighter and champion for Mozambique’s wildlife and its spectacular wild places. Mozambique has seen a remarkable turnaround in the Niassa National Reserve, where no elephants have been poached since May of 2018. This incredible success is due to a collaborative effort with ANAC, WCS, and concession operators in the park, combined with deployment of a special police rapid intervention unit; enhanced equipping and training of rangers; satellite-tracking collaring of elephant herds; providing surveillance; and tough new sentencing of poachers. “For almost 40 years, Carlos has made outstanding contributions to his country’s wildlife protection efforts in many different respects – from veterinary achievements, to law enforcement efforts, to wildlife translocation programs. WCS is extremely proud of Carlos’s dedication to conservation, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with him and his team in the coming years.” The Tusk Conservation Awards are presented annually in partnership with Investec Asset Management.
