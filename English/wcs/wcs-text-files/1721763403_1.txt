The following statement was released by Dr. Susan Lieberman, WCS Vice President of International Policy and a member of the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce: “The world is attuned to the fact that wildlife trafficking has become a global problem. And the ongoing flow of illegal wildlife products to both eastern and western markets is damaging not only vulnerable wildlife populations but the livelihoods of the people that live among them. “The Royal Foundation and the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce bring together those who can make a real difference at a critical stage of the trafficking chain. The agreement signed today will help industry take steps to remove the deficiencies in transportation and customs capability that are being exploited by criminal traffickers. “When I signed the Buckingham Palace Declaration on behalf of the Wildlife Conservation Society today, it was an affirmation of 12 months of work and negotiations in good faith by organizations and companies that truly can help stop traffickers and criminal networks from moving illicit products to market, and allow threatened wildlife populations to begin to recover from the scourge of poaching and trafficking in their parts. “The United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce Buckingham Palace Declaration sends a clear message to wildlife criminals: Do not enter—you will be stopped.” ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
