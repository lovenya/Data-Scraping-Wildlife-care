Following a tour of the aquarium’s Ocean Wonders: Sharks! exhibit, Mayor de Blasio gave remarks promoting the new vaccination site and encouraged all New Yorkers to get vaccinated. The Mayor was joined by Councilmember Treyger whose district includes Coney Island and the New York Aquarium. Also in attendance were Alexandra Silversmith, Executive Director, Alliance for Coney Island; Hanna Glikman, Community Associate, Community Board 13; and John F. Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs; and Craig Piper, WCS Interim Director of the New York Aquarium and Director of City Zoos. During his remarks, de Blasio focused on families and children, Brooklynites, and all New Yorkers urging all to get vaccinated.  He applauded WCS’s essential workers who worked through the pandemic to provide care for the zoo and aquarium animals every day.   Said Calvelli: “We are honored to partner with New York City to bring this vaccination site to our neighbors in Coney Island and to all New Yorkers. We agree with the Mayor that New York is rebounding from the pandemic.  Our recovery will not be complete though until all New Yorkers are vaccinated and are proud to be a part of the solution by hosting vaccination sites at both the New York Aquarium and the Bronx Zoo.” Similar to the site at the Bronx Zoo, all individuals receiving a vaccine at the New York Aquarium will be given a complimentary ticket for a future visit. Ticket dates are pre-determined by the New York Aquarium and cannot be exchanged for a different day. Due to park capacity considerations, the courtesy ticket issued upon vaccination will be for a future visit date. New York City’s COVID-19 vaccination sites at the New York Aquarium and Bronx Zoo are now open and will provide free COVID-19 vaccinations through June 30, on weekdays, 10am to 5pm. The vaccination sites are a part of the city’s efforts to incentivize New Yorkers to get vaccinated. The Pfizer vaccine will be administered at both sites; all New Yorkers ages 12+ are eligible, and those ages 12-17 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. No appointment is necessary. To get a vaccine guests can walk-in or schedule an appointment by visiting NYC Vaccine Finder and selecting the New York Aquarium or Bronx Zoo, or by calling 877-VAX-4NYC (877-829-4692).
