A Baringo giraffe pauses to take a drink of water in the African Plains at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo. These giraffes use their long necks and tongues to reach food high up in trees and drink by widening or bending their legs in order to get down to the water.



In the wild, giraffes live throughout central, east, and southern Africa where they stay near grasslands, savannas, and wooded areas. The giraffes at the Bronx Zoo are a subspecies called a Baringo or Rothschild’s giraffes and are native to western Kenya and eastern Uganda. 


The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays, 5:30 p.m. weekends.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world’s largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.</http:>
