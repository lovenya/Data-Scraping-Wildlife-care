						Bronx, NY – Dec. 27, 2017 – Tundra, the Bronx Zoo’s 26 -year-old polar bear, was euthanized on Saturday due to medical conditions associated with old age.    A necropsy showed Tundra to have chronic kidney disease causing acute kidney failure and progressive arthritis that worsened despite treatment.    “Tundra, who was born at the Bronx Zoo in 1991, was loved by our staff and visitors,” said Jim Breheny, Director of the Bronx Zoo and Executive Vice President of Zoos and Aquarium for the Wildlife Conservation Society. “Many of us grew up with Tundra. He lived a long life under the dedicated care of our keeper and veterinary staffs.  Despite his age he remained extremely active and playful until just before his death. Tundra served as an important ambassador for his species, giving our guests an opportunity to see the power, majesty and grace of polar bears while learning about the problems these bears face in the wild due to a changing environment.”    At this point, the Bronx Zoo is not planning to acquire another polar bear or to exhibit the species again in the near future.
