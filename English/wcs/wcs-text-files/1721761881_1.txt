Despite the many negative issues surrounding the ivory trade, the popular PBS program "Antiques Roadshow" continues to appraise ivory pieces on-air. These segments send the wrong message to the public, and help perpetuate the black market that is wiping out elephants, which is why WCS is urging the program to stop it's on-air appraisals. 

96 Elephants has launched a fictional appraisal on YouTube that sheds light on the slaughter of elephants and humans due to the ongoing demand for ivory. Although Antiques Roadshow mentions the legal requirements to sell ivory, WCS says that the legal trade of ivory masks the dangerous black market trade. 

Said John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs and Director of the 96 Elephants campaign: “Thirty-five thousand elephants were slaughtered last year due to the demand for ivory. We know that the legal trade has a confusing set of loopholes that allows the black market trade to thrive. We believe that Antiques Roadshow has a moral obligation to do the right thing and halt ivory appraisals as while this crisis rages on.”
