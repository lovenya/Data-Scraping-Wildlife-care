Due to the rising air quality index, and out of concern for our staff, visitors, and animals, the WCS parks -- Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, New York Aquarium, -- closed at 3pm today.Â  Animals will be brought into their night quarters early. We thank all for understanding as we navigate through these challenging environmental conditions caused by the Canadian wildfires. We will continue to monitor and will issue updates as necessary.
