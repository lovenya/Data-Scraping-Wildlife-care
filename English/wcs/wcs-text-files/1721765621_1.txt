						A group of 5th grade students from the Speyer Legacy School on the Upper West Side formed a club to help make an impact on wildlife conservation. Their “Save the Wildlife Club” hosted a bake sale to raise money for their mission. With the help of two matching grants, the club raised a total of $3,800 which they donated to the Wildlife Conservation Society.  The club presented the donation to Craig Piper, WCS’s Director of City Zoos, on Saturday, Nov. 16 at the WCS Central Park Zoo. In appreciation for their effort and dedication to saving wildlife, the students were treated to a special experience at the zoo and had the opportunity to meet the Central Park Zoo California sea lions and participate in a feeding with the animal care staff. Their contribution will help the Wildlife Conservation Society further its mission of saving wildlife in New York and around the world.
