						Sustainable seafood and perfect wine pairings were featured at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s seventh annual Sip for the Sea – a benefit that showcases and celebrates WCS’s marine conservation and education work at the New York Aquarium and around the globe. The annual event offers sustainable seafood and other delectable tastes from some of the top restaurants in New York City and wine pairings provided by Cono Sur Vineyards & Winery. All proceeds help further the mission of WCS and the New York Aquarium to save wildlife and wild places. WCS’s Marine Conservation Program operates in more than 20 countries globally and focuses on several initiatives to help safeguard marine diversity. WCS scientists provide technical assistance in the establishment of marine protected areas in some of the world’s most important marine ecosystems. In local waters, the New York Aquarium’s local conservation initiative, the New York Seascape Program, focuses on studying local species that inhabit and move through the New York Bight, a water body found between Montauk and Cape May, NJ. In addition to field research, New York Seascape also works on marine policy, public outreach, and visitor engagement, all vital activities for effective marine conservation and education.
