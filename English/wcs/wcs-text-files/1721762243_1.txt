Free family workshop about animals and nature 

Sundays, Nov. 2014 through April 2015

Brooklyn, N.Y. – Sept. 9, 2014 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo will hold Nature Playtime workshops on Sundays, Nov. 2014 through April 2015, 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 

These weekly workshops will be outside the zoo’s native plant garden and are designed to help families explore nature through play. Activities include making nature-inspired art, insect observation, playing with snow, and more. Participants will also receive a nature play activity guide to Prospect Park, focusing on areas such as the Zucker Natural Exploration Area that is located near the zoo. 

Nature Playtime activities are led by zoo educators, with the support of trained teen Discovery Guides. Some activities are designed for families to do on their own including creation of scavenger hunts for future zoo visits and sketching zoo animals. 

Nature Playtime is free with admission to the Prospect Park Zoo. It is a partnership with the Prospect Park Zoo, Tinkergarten, and the Prospect Park Alliance. The program is funded by the Walt Disney Conservation Fund.
