				 Bronx, New York – Jan. 4, 2011 – “Mayor Bloomberg’s announcement today that New York City drew a record-breaking number of visitors in 2010 is right on track with what we are finding at our Wildlife Conservation Society parks. In Fiscal year 2010, WCS parks – the Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo – together scored a record high attendance of 4.46 million visitors. The Bronx Zoo and all our parks, like other nonprofit cultural organizations, bring in tourism, tax dollars and jobs to New York City. We were pleased to see the Mayor and Cultural Affairs Commissioner Kate D. Levin highlight that nonprofit culture is “the backbone” to tourism in our city. As the city officials noted, New York City's 1,200 nonprofit cultural organizations generate an estimated $18 billion in economic activity. We are proud to be a part of the dynamic economic spirit of our city.”
