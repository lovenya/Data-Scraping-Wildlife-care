						New York – Sept. 28, 2017 – Twenty-three of New York City's best chefs paired their food with great wine from Bonterra Organic Vineyards at Sip for the Sea 2017 to benefit the WCS’s New York Aquarium. Hundreds attended the event, which raised awareness about the importance of sustainable seafood.  All proceeds will support the New York Aquarium and WCS’s commitment to marine conservation locally and around the world.  Chefs from the following restaurants participated in Sip for the Sea 2017: Almond; Amali; Atera; Bowery Meat Company; Burger and Lobster; Crave Fishbar; Davio’s Northern Italian Steakhouse; Delaware and Hudson; ESCA; Kitchen 21; L&W Oyster Co; Luke’s Lobster; Matro’s Steakhouse Manhattan; Perrine; Pier A Harbor House; Searmore’s; Shuka; Tavern on the Green; Thalassa Restaurant; Tocqueville Restaurant; The Tuck Room; Chef Hugo Uys for ROAR Africa. “At the New York Aquarium we engage visitors to care about our ocean and waterways every day, and with Sip for Sea, we welcome the opportunity to further educate people about how to be ocean-friendly consumers of seafood,” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS VP and Director of the WCS New York Aquarium. “The world’s ocean needs all of us to understand the importance of sustainable seafood.” WCS’s New York Aquarium is the oldest continually operating aquarium in the United States, having opened to the public in Battery Park, Manhattan, in 1896. Since then, it has had a fascinating history and has been home to an exotic array of aquatic wildlife. This year’s Sip for the Sea focused on the future of the aquarium, including the construction of Ocean Wonders: Sharks!, and the ongoing field work being done by the NY Seascape, the aquarium’s local marine conservation program. With many fish species facing serious threats from overfishing, sustainable seafood options help ensure the longevity of diverse and healthy ocean ecosystems around the world.  Sip for the Sea attendees learned about marine conservation in the waters around New York and see some of the Central Park Zoo’s amazing animals, including California sea lions, harbor seals, and more.  Sip for the Sea Media Partner:        Yelp
