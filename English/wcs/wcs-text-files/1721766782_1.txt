						Bronx, NY – April 30, 2022 – The event that marks the official start of spring/summer in New York City – The WCS Run for the Wild – returned to the Bronx Zoo today for the 14th consecutive year.

Thousands ran, jogged, and walked through the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo in support of wildlife conservation. Each year the WCS Run for the Wild is dedicated to an animal in need of conservation support to raise awareness of threats they face. This year the event was dedicated to hornbills to help WCS raise important funds to further its mission of saving wildlife in New York and around the world. Since its inception in 2009, more than 65,000 people have participated.

The man and woman first to finish the untimed 5k run: Toby Zitsman of Brooklyn, NY and Cara Trulli of Freehold, NJ.

After the run, all participants were invited to stay at the Bronx Zoo to enjoy the wildlife for the rest of the day and had zoo grounds and exhibit to themselves until 1pm. Post event activities included games, music, and other activities on the Bronx Zoo’s historic Astor Court.

Of course, the zoo’s marquee exhibits are all open for everyone to enjoy for the day to inspire runners and to teach participants about the conservation programs that benefit from their support. This was opening day for the Wild Asia Monorail, and exhibits like Tiger Mountain, Madagascar!, and JungleWorld are just a few others that bring people face-to-face with some of the species that they are helping to save through their participation in or support of the WCS Run for the Wild.

WCS Run for the Wild is made possible by the generous support of:
