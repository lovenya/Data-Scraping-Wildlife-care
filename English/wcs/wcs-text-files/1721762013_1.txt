The Duke of Cambridge, President of United for Wildlife, was recently joined by David Beckham to launch a new campaign aimed at the social media generation. The goal is to harness the power of sports and social media to ask young people whose side they are on: the side of illegal killing or the side of species preservation.

The illegal wildlife trade thrives because it is hidden – which makes it easier for criminals to operate. The #WhoseSideAreYouOn campaign calls for people to show their support by signing up via Facebook, Twitter or Google+, subscribing to the United for Wildlife YouTube channel or visiting the website (www.unitedforwildlife.org) to find out more. Young people can bring attention to the conservation issue by watching or participating in United for Wildlife sports events. 

The global ambassadors for the campaign will reach out through sports events and social media, urging people to take action and educate themselves about the crisis. The Duke of Cambridge said: “… Enough is enough. It is time to choose between critically endangered species and the criminals who kill them for money.”
