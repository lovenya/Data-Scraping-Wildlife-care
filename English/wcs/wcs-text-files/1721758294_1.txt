Brooklyn, NY - July, 2010 – Whether you’re a professional painter or just have an appreciation for art and animals, the annual Wild Arts Weekend at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) Prospect Park Zoo has something for everyone. 

 

The Wild Arts Weekend – a celebration of all things animal from original works of art to hands-on activities – will be held on Saturday and Sunday, July 17 and 18 from 10am to 4:30pm. The weekend will provide a wild array of thrilling activities, including live painting demos, puppet shows, and of course, exciting encounters with some of the zoo’s most popular animals.

 

Painters will be set up throughout the zoo to showcase their work, but the fun isn’t all left to the pros.  Kids will also get a chance to see a puppet show, get their face painted like their favorite animal, create a fish print to take home, and much more.
