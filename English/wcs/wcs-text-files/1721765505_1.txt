						The Bronx Zoo is once again celebrating the coming of fall with a Halloween tradition that has become a family favorite for New Yorkers and tourists alike.  Boo at the Zoo returns to the Bronx on weekends starting Saturday, September 28 through Sunday, November 3 (including Columbus Day, October 14). Boo at the Zoo activities will include traditional favorites such as daily magic shows, costume parades, professional pumpkin carving demos, crafts, the spooky extinct animal graveyard, and much more. The Halloween-themed weekends embrace the spirit of the season while incorporating wildlife as only the Bronx Zoo can do. Guests will have an opportunity to see and learn about many of the animals often associated with Halloween folklore on Astor Court during animal meet and greets with vultures, owls, ravens, and more. Bootoberfest also returns to Boo at the Zoo weekends with music, lawn games, and seasonal food. For night owls, the zoo has added night walks that through the zoo. These events are ticketed separately and available for families or 21+ adults. Visit the special events page for dates and ticket information. Finally, Boo at the Zoo will be the last chance to check out one of the summer’s most popular experiences – the Bronx Zoo’s Dinosaur Safari. The immersive experience takes adventurers on a ride through a two-acre wooded area of the Bronx Zoo where 40 ultra-realistic, life-sized animatronic dinosaurs lurk – including two massive 40-foot long Tyrannosaurus rex. Dinosaur Safari runs every day through November 3. For ticket information and a full schedule of Boo at the Zoo activities and events, visit BronxZoo.com. Boo at the Zoo is sponsored by Coca-Cola.
