						Coney Island, NY Aug. 17, 2020 – The New York Aquarium will reopen to the public on Thursday, Aug. 27 after being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 16. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) member-only days will be Aug. 24-26. The aquarium’s decision to reopen follows New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo’s announcement on Friday that museums and other cultural institutions can open in New York City starting on Aug. 24. Many of the indoor exhibits and spaces at the four WCS zoos will also reopen. Information on the opening of indoor exhibits at the zoos will be reported on the zoos’ websites. All reopening plans will be adjusted as needed based on state guidelines and COVID-19 indicators. “We are thrilled to once again welcome guests back to the aquarium,” said New York Aquarium Director Jon Forrest Dohlin. “We will debut a new exhibit, Spineless, along with a harbor seal and two sea lion pups. We are pleased to once again welcome guests to Ocean Wonders: Sharks! and all of our exhibits which highlight marine species and stories from New York waters and around the globe. “As we reopen, I want to offer special thanks to our essential staff who have been working every day since the closure in March to provide world-class care for our animals while keeping park operations running smoothly. They are a credit to our organization and are looking forward to once again receiving visitors at the aquarium.” The aquarium’s reopening coincides with the public debut of Spineless, a new exhibit highlighting the diversity of marine species such as octopus, squid, jellyfish, and other species that lack backbones.
