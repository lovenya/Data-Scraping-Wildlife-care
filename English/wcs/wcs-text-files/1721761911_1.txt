This year, the WCS annual Gala will honor three esteemed women for their dynamic roles in bringing the WCS mission to realization. Through the Clinton Global Initiative and Clinton Foundation, Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation Chelsea Clinton have been tremendous allies in the fight to save the African elephant. WCS Trustee Diane Christensen has supported our mission for over 15 years as a member of the Board of Trustees and cares passionately about global conservation, the protection of wildlife and wild places, and long-term wildlife health and diversity around the globe.



The gala, An Elephant’s Tale, will engage guests in WCS’s efforts to save the elephant populations struggling to survive within the forests and savannahs of Central Africa. The evening will serve as a reminder of the crisis elephants currently face in Africa and also as a celebration of these gentle giants who play a crucial ecological role in their habitats.
