WCS Newsroom: http://newsroom.wcs.org/ @WCSNewsroom: https://twitter.com/WCSNewsroom New York – Aug. 17, 2016 – As WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) New York Aquarium celebrates 120 years, it will host the fourth annual Sip for the Sea at the WCS Central Park Zoo on Thursday, Sept. 15, at 6:30 p.m. Sip for the Sea is presented by Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic. The event will bring together New York City’s top chefs to serve up sustainable seafood and other selections, including vegetarian offerings. All proceeds go to support the WCS New York Aquarium and WCS’s commitment to marine conservation in New York and around the world. WCS’s New York Aquarium is the oldest continually operating aquarium in the United States, having opened to the public in Battery Park, Manhattan, in 1896. Since then, it has had a fascinating history and has been home to an exotic array of aquatic wildlife. This year’s Sip for the Sea event will focus on the future of the aquarium, including the construction of Ocean Wonders: Sharks!, and the ongoing field work being done by the NY Seascape, the aquarium’s local marine conservation program. Chefs from the following restaurants will be dishing up dinner at Sip for the Sea 2016:      * Almond * Atlantic Grill Lincoln Center * Dante * Davio’s Manhattan * Hundred Acres * L&W Oyster Co * Luke’s Lobster * Isabella’s * Monument Lane     * Parlor Steak & Fish * Writing Room * Perrine * Pier A Harbor House * SUSHISAMBA * Tavern on the Green * Thalassa Restaurant * Tocqueville Restaurant * Zengo      The evening will feature pairings of sustainable wines from Jekel Vineyards and Bonterra Organic Vineyards with sustainable seafood and other special offerings.  With many fish species facing serious threats from overfishing, sustainable seafood options help ensure the longevity of diverse and healthy ocean ecosystems around the world.  Sip for the Sea attendees will learn about marine conservation in the waters around New York and see some of the Central Park Zoo’s amazing animals, including California sea lions, harbor seals, and more.  Hashtag for the event: #sipforsea.
