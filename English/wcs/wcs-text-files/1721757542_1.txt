Bronx
				 Zoo Hosts Ten Days of Arts Workshops in Collaboration with the Museum for African Art at Dancing Crane Plaza
 



As part of the 10th anniversary celebration of the Bronx
Zoo’s Congo
 Gorilla Forest
exhibit, the Wildlife Conservation Society – the zoo’s parent
organization – is hosting ten days of craft-making workshops in
collaboration with the Museum for African Art.


The workshops, which will take place at the Bronx Zoo’s Dancing Crane
Plaza, are based on artistic
traditions from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Central
 Africa. Participants will have the opportunity to learn about the Democratic Republic of the Congo
from teaching artists while participating in the arts of mask making, basket
making, gourd adornment and beading.  These programs will inspire children
and their families, through the art that they create and the knowledge they
gain in the process. 



Workshops will take place 11:00
 am - 4:00 pm
Fridays and Saturday from June 19 – July 18. The scheduled times for each
20-minute workshop are: 11:00 am,
11:40 am, 1:00 pm, 1:40 pm, 2:20 pm, 3:00 pm
and 3:40 pm.
