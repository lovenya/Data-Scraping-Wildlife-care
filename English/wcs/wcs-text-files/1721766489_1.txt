ON THE EVE OF THE 20th ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11, we have issued a message remembering those we lost and all who responded on that day and through the years at home and abroad. Our tribute includes a remembrance of  Tim O’Sullivan, a WCS retiree, who died at the World Trade Center. To Tim’s family and friends, we want to ensure you we will never forget him and all he did for WCS and our staff in his 23-year career.
