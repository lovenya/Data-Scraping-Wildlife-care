One of three rescued adult cheetahs released last week in Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. The release was conducted by a team of conservationists from the Wildlife Conservation Society, Zoological Society of London (ZSL), and Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) working with the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) and the Tanzania Wildlife Division. Â The cheetahs were confiscated from an illegal wildlife trader in the Tanzanian city of Arusha. Each cheetah was fitted with a satellite collar, and will now be tracked by conservationists to monitor their movements to see how they are settling into their new home. This is the first known case of cheetah trafficking in Tanzania, and it worryingly suggests that the illegal trade of this protected species is increasing.
