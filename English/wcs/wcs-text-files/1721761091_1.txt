Bronx, NY – July 2, 2013 – A frog beetle displays iridescent coloration in its exhibit at JungleWorld at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo. Frog beetles are one of an estimated 400,000 species of beetles.  
 
The frog beetle is native to the jungles of Southeast Asia. Their back legs are large in comparison to their bodies, giving them a frog-like appearance. Their legs are covered with thousands of hair follicles to help them climb and cling to foliage. 

The males are larger than their female counterparts, and both have a very reflective, metallic exoskeleton. 
The Bronx Zoo’s JungleWorld houses animals from tropical Asia.  WCS works to save wildlife and habitats throughout the Asian continent.
