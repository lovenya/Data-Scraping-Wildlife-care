						Bronx, N.Y. – April 30, 2016 – More than 5,400 ran, jogged, and walked through the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo in support of wildlife conservation at the 8th annual WCS Run for the Wild.  The first to finish the 5k run was Christopher Stewart from The Bronx who finished with a time of 17:42 – his third year in a row winning the race. The top three women and top three men finishers were: Women: Fiona Bayly from New York, NY (18:32) – Running for frogs Catherine Knoff from New York, NY (20:20) – Running for elephants Marissa Keiser from Kendall Park, NJ (20:55) – Running for turtles Men: Christopher Stewart from Bronx, NY (17:42) – Running for elephants Mike Russo from Scottsdale, NY (18:26) – Running for tigers Skyler Russo from New York, NY (18:22) – Running for elephants Each year, WCS Run for the Wild is committed to raising awareness of the threats facing wildlife while raising money to help WCS conservation work at the Bronx Zoo and around the world. This year runners and walkers can choose to participate on behalf of whatever species most inspires them. Since its inception in 2009, more than 40,000 people have participated. “Each and every participant, supporter, and donor is helping WCS make real progress in the fight to save wildlife and wild places,” said John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. After the run, everyone was invited to stay at the Bronx Zoo to enjoy the wildlife for the rest of the day. This year’s activities included an entirely new line-up including local microbrew beer garden (age 21 and above); a rock climbing wall; and a silent disco on the Bronx Zoo’s historic Astor Court. Of course, the zoo’s marquee exhibits were also open for everyone to enjoy for the day to inspire runners and to teach participants about the conservation programs that benefit from their support. This was opening day for the Wild Asia Monorail, and exhibits like Tiger Mountain, Madagascar!, and JungleWorld are just a few others that bring people face-to-face with some of the species that they are helping to save through their participation in or support of the WCS Run for the Wild.
