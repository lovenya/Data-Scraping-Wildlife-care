Manhattan Borough President Stringer and WCS Commemorate Manhattan's First 400 years with a Celebratory Cake
 
Saturday, Sept. 12, 12:15 p.m., WCS's Central Park Zoo
 
New York, N.Y., Sept. 12, 2009 – It is time to celebrate Manhattan's 400 years of greatness.
 
It has been 400 years since Henry Hudson arrived on the shores of Manhattan, discovering a land of lush forests, meadows, and wetlands that existed long before the cityscape we know today. Long before Times Square.
 
To celebrate this historic anniversary, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and WCS will co-host a special cake-cutting ceremony on Saturday, Sept. 12, 12:15 p.m. at the Central Park Zoo. 
 
Borough President Stringer will share cake, good cheer and a lot of history with WCS and guests. The cake, inspired by illustrations of Mannahatta, will be created by Dan Dan Baking, LLC. 

“In the four centuries since Henry Hudson's boat sailed to our shore, this island has never stopped changing. That's one thing that you can count on in Manhattan - our skyline is never complete and our city is constantly evolving. I'm glad to join the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Central Park Zoo to wish this great Borough of ours a very happy 400th birthday,” said Manhattan Borough President Scott M. Stringer.
 
The event will follow a lecture in the zoo’s gallery by WCS ecologist Eric Sanderson who organized WCS’ Mannahatta Project, which explores how Manhattan has changed since 1609. Sanderson has commemorated the occasion throughout the year through a new book, an interactive Web site, and an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York on view through October 13.
