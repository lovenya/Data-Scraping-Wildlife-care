Birdwatchers from across Asia and beyond flock to Cambodia's forests for a glimpse of two of the world's rarest birds: the giant ibis and its cousin the white-shouldered ibis. Each year, the birders follow the birds to their nesting grounds at the outskirts of Tmatboey, a rural Cambodian village some 200 miles north of Phnom Penh.
		Under the protection of the Tmatboey villagers, the ibises breed, nest, and raise their chicks. In return for their contribution to the birds’ conservation, WCS worked with the community to develop an eco-tourism project. This partnership has helped bring the village a new perspective on their sacred forest.
