The spring tradition was held virtually in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the event has been reimagined for 2021 to meet city and state social distancing and capacity protocols. WCS Run for the Wild will take place at the Bronx Zoo on Saturday, April 24, 2021. Registration for individuals and teams is open at WCSRunForTheWild.org and a full list of event changes that participants will need to know can be found HERE. Among the pandemic-related safety changes for this year:  Two starting locations for runners and walkers:   Bronx River Parking lot for 5K runners;  Southern Blvd Parking Lot for the 3K Family Run/Walk.   Start times staggered every 30 minutes:   8 to 10am for the 5K run;  10:30a to 12:30p for the 3K Family Run/Walk.   Bronx Zoo will open to WCS Run for the Wild participants only. No spectators permitted.  Limited capacity to allow for social distancing Each year the WCS Run for the Wild is dedicated to species in need of conservation support to raise awareness of threats they face. This year the event is dedicated to lemurs and will help WCS raise important funds to further its mission of saving wildlife in New York and around the world. Runners, walkers, and wildlife supporters are invited to participate and/or make a donation to support a participating runner or team. Each participant is encouraged to seek donations and there are prizes for achieving the fundraising goals. There is a $35 minimum fundraising requirement for all participants age 16 and older. Registration fees are $55 for adults and $45 for children and seniors. There is a $10 discount for members. Those who prefer to participate virtually, virtual run registration is $15. All runners and walkers are encouraged to stay for the day and take part in post-run activities and the zoo will be open only to event participants all day. Visit the resident wildlife in all of the Bronx Zoo exhibits including the six species of lemurs in Madagascar! There are more than 100 species of lemurs and they are all only found in Madagascar. Habitat loss, deforestation, and other human activities pose threats to all wild lemur populations. The Wildlife Conservation Society works across the globe and within the lemurs’ range to save wildlife and wild places.
