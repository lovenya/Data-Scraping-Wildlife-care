In the 1950s, President Eisenhower led the creation of a national system of interstate highways across the United States. Though the system was originally conceived as a necessary part of defending the country, today it is the primary basis of our nation’s commerce and travel. Until recently, little thought was devoted to the implications of building roads through wildlife migration corridors.
These corridors – the paths that wildlife follow to access seasonal resources such as various foods, water and mating opportunities – ensure the persistence of a wide range of migratory animals across the globe.
