The peacock who spent last night in a tree outside the Bronx Zoo flew back onto zoo grounds under his own initiative at 11:19 a.m. We kept an eye on the bird this morning as he started to move around at dawn and fully expected him to return to the zoo as he did. We had confidence in our knowledge of bird behavior to predict how he would behave if given the chance to do so without interference. We were confident in our staffsâ€™ ability to handle the situation. We thank the NYPD and NYC Parks Department for their assistance.
