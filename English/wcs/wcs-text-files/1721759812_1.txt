Sea lion picks Giants and predicts a rough day for Tom Brady		
		Bronx, NY – January 25, 2012 – Kiani, a 630-pound male California sea lion, joined Bronx Zoo animal keeper Cindy Maur; Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director; and Fox 5 reporter Jill Nicolini for a live segment on Good Day New York this morning. When asked for his prediction of Super Bowl XLVI, Kiani promptly shook his head in favor of a New York Giants victory.  When asked about Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Kiani lay on the ground to indicate Brady would be spending much of the game on the turf. 

Kiani has never been wrong with his Super Bowl picks. (This is his first!)
