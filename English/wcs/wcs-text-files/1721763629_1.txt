Queens Zoo Director and Animal Curator Scott Silver is in the front, kneeling. Mets players James Loney and Matt Reynolds joined about a dozen fifth graders from P.S. 143Q, Corona, in making enrichment buckets for the zoo’s Andean bears. The buckets were filled with various fruits such as watermelon slices that were then frozen and placed in their exhibit by zookeepers. Treats such are often given to the bears to provide a stimulating activity that helps keep them active and healthy. The group also went to the zoo’s farm area to learn about horses and other domestic animals. The event was part of the Amazin’ City program where the Mets take students to New York City landmarks and cultural institutions.
