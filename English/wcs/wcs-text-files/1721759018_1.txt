Bronx, New York – Feb. 14, 2011 – More than 4,000 romantics have already named a Madagascar hissing cockroach after a beloved for Valentine's Day, sending a clear message to their sweethearts that their love will last forever – just like a roach.



The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo, with more than 58,000 of these roaches living in its Madagascar! exhibit, is thankful for each name. With its V-Roach gift idea, WCS has raised $40,000 to save wildlife and wild places around the world."A roach for Valentine's Day is proving to be priceless,"  said John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. Who says romance isn't alive and well?"



Some of the roaches at the zoo are now blessed with such names as: Hissing Hottie, Cranky Frankie, Lisa Lovebug, and Hisssterical.



Anyone can still name a roach after a loved one by going to http://www.bronxzoo.com/name-a-roach/ by 6 a.m. EST, Tuesday, Feb. 15.



Madagascar hissing cockroaches are the world’s largest roach species reaching nearly four-inches long. The namesake hissing noise is emitted as a defense mechanism. Like nearly every roach species, Madagascar hissing cockroaches are not considered pests and rarely enter homes.
