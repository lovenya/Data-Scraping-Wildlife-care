						New York, NY - August 17, 2020 - It’s no secret that women are grossly underrepresented in STEM careers, especially women of color.  Designed to activate a culture shift among young girls and inspire the next generation of STEM pioneers, Lyda Hill Philanthropies®’ IF/THEN® Initiative  has created #IfThenSheCan – The Exhibit, a new monumental 3D-printed display of 122 female statues - the most women statues ever assembled in one location, at one time. Featuring contemporary women of all ages and backgrounds who currently work in a variety of STEM careers, the 3D statue exhibit was originally scheduled to open earlier this year. While COVID-19 delayed the launch of the full exhibit, IF/THEN® has arranged for a pop-up preview of the exhibit – six statues to be unveiled and displayed at WCS’s Central Park Zoo in New York City.Statues are slated to be displayed at the Central Park Zoo from Monday, August 17 – October, 2020. The six women, all AAAS IF/THEN® Ambassadors, displayed as statues at Central Park Zoo are: Kristine Inman, Wildlife BiologistRae Wynn-Grant, Large Carnivore Ecologist, National Geographic SocietyDorothy Tovar, Stanford University, Microbiologist focused on bat - human zoonotic disease transmissionJess Cramp, Shark Researcher and Marine Conservationist, Sharks Pacific Earyn McGee, Herpetologist focused on lizards, University of ArizonaKristen Lear, Bat Conservationist, Bat Conservation International      INTERVIEWS:AAAS IF/THEN® Ambassadors depicted in the statues;Nicole Small, President and CEO of Lyda Hill Philanthropies.Karen Tingley, Director of Education, Wildlife Conservation SocietyA downloadable, digital asset library of women STEM innovators, including the women depicted in the statue exhibit, is available through the IF/THEN® Collection, which was recently launched by IF/THEN®.  The Collection is the largest, free resource library of its kind celebrating diverse, contemporary women in STEM.  CONTACT:    Jodi Davis, Goodman Media for Lyda Hill Philanthropies201-927-6171IfThenPR@GoodmanMedia.comMax Pulsinelli, WCS/Central Park Zoo571-218-7601mpulsinelli@wcs.org ABOUT IF/THEN IF/THEN® is part of Lyda Hill Philanthropies’ commitment to fund game-changing advancements in science and nature.
