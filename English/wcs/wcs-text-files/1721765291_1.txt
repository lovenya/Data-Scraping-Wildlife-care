Each year, WCS Run for the Wild is committed to raising awareness of the threats facing wildlife while raising money to help WCS conservation work at the Bronx Zoo and around the world. This year, people are running and walking on behalf of giraffes, a threatened species whose numbers are plummeting across its range in Africa.

The 5k race for individual runners will begin at 8:00 a.m.; casual runners and walkers can take part in the Family Fun Run/Walk at 8:45 a.m. More than 5,000 runners and walkers are expected to participate.     What: 11th annual WCS Run for the Wild             5k run and family fun run/walk Who:   Wildlife Conservation Society/Bronx Zoo When: Saturday, April 27, 2019 Runners start at 8:00 a.m.  Casual runners and walkers start at 8:45 a.m.  Media check-in begins at 7:00 a.m. at the VIP tent Where: WCS’s Bronx Zoo Bronx River Entrance (Exit 6 off Bronx River Parkway)                         **Media note(s):  Members of the media who wish to cover the event are asked to contact Max Pulsinelli at 718-220-5182; 571-218-7601 (cell); or mpulsinelli@wcs.org so that reserved parking and in-park transportation can be arranged.
