						Holiday Lights is underway at the Bronx Zoo and the beloved holiday tradition is introducing the Ice Jubilee to the holiday light show that will include an Ice Bar for adults as well as a giant ice throne and slide for the perfect seasonal photo-op. Ice Jubilee festivities will run from December 20 to 31 (except Dec. 24 and 25). Holiday revelers can take photos siting upon an oversized throne made completely of ice or take a ride down the 20-foot ice slide. Visitors over 21 years old can take a break with a seasonal cocktail at the 12-foot ice bar which will be serving up traditional holiday favorites like eggnog, hot toddy, or spiced mulled wine. Professional ice carvers will put their skills on display each night with wildlife-themed ice carving demonstrations. On Saturday, December 28, five of the talented ice carving pros will face off in an ice carving competition.Â  They will attempt 20 icy animal creations in an elimination style speed carving showdown. The winner will receive a cash prize provided by Sculpted Ice Works, a WCS membership, and the coveted championship trophy. All of the sculptures will be displayed for as long as temperatures permit.
