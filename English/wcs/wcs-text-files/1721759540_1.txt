New York – September 7, 2011 – Aggie, the Dexter cow, at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo has died due to old age. 

Aggie was 18. Dexter cows live an average of 15 to 20 years. Aggie was born in May 1993. For the past 18 years, she lived in the Barnyard at Prospect Park Zoo next to alpacas, sheep, and miniature horses. She frequently received letters from admirers in her “moo box.”

 

“You are beautiful and I would never want to eat you,” wrote one young fan. Another wrote, “Dearest Agatha you are the color to my rainbow…”

  

“Aggie will be greatly missed,” said Denise McClean, Director of the Prospect Park Zoo. “People grew up visiting her and came back to the zoo to see her through the years. She had a big personality and loved the attention. ”Contact:
