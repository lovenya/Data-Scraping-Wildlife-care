Giraffe calf to join herd in Bronx Zoo’s African Plains  
Bronx, NY –  March 22, 2012 – A female Baringo giraffe calf born this month at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo stays close to her mother in the Carter Giraffe Building. The calf will be making its debut in the zoo’s African Plains in about one week. 
 
The calf was approximately 6 feet tall and over 100 pounds at birth. As an adult, she could eventually grow to 16 feet and weigh 2,600 pounds. 
 
Giraffes are native to grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands in central, east, and southern Africa. The Baringo, or Rothschild’s, giraffe is found in western Kenya and eastern Uganda. While giraffe populations are robust in many places, overall the population is decreasing. The Wildlife Conservation Society works across the globe and within the giraffe’s African range to save wildlife and wild places. WCS is working to protect giraffes in key African landscapes like Zakouma, Chad, Murchison Falls, Uganda, and in the Sahel of South Sudan. 
 
The calf has not been named as of now. The Bronx Zoo names all of its giraffes in memory of Mr. and Mrs. James Carter, benefactors for the Carter Giraffe Building.
