Bronx, NY – August 10, 2010 – The Belmont Business Improvement District (BBID), which fosters economic development and cultural tourism for the property owners, merchants, and residents of the famous Belmont area in the Bronx, presented $100 in “Great Taste of Tradition” gift cards to the winners of a special drawing celebrating the new lion cubs at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo.

 

Everyone that participated in the city-wide effort to name the three new lion cubs on bronxzoo.com was automatically entered into the drawing. The winners – Tania Artiles, Cheryl Chiovetta, and Ester Feldbaum – were randomly selected and were presented with their gift cards on the famous Arthur Avenue. 

 

“We find it extremely important to work with WCS to encourage people to explore the Bronx Zoo and Belmont shops and eateries,” said Frank Franz, Chairman of the Belmont Business Improvement District.  “We thought it would be fun to reward people who participated in the lion cub-naming and say, ‘when you visit the zoo, please stop by and make a day of it… we're so close by.’”

 

The Belmont BID encompasses portions of the neighborhood that include famous commercial strips such as Fordham Road along with Arthur Avenue and East 187th Street of the Bronx's Little Italy, an aromatic destination of restaurants and food stores.
