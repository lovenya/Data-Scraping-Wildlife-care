The third annual 5k run/walk through WCS’s Bronx Zoo is dedicated to helping save penguins, and every participant who raises $30 or more in support of WCS’s work with penguins will receive a T-shirt featuring the winning design.  “The Run for the Wild T-shirts are always a popular part of this annual event,” said John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. “By offering everyone a chance to design this year’s shirt, the runners and walkers will be almost as well dressed as the tuxedo-clad birds WCS is working to save.”   Contest entries must be submitted online at www.wcs.runforthewild.org by Thursday, March 17. Design submissions will be narrowed down to five finalists from which the winner will be chosen by online vote.  Since this year’s Run for the Wild is dedicated to saving penguins, artwork submitted to the contest should be penguin-themed for the front of the shirt only. Each design must be an original unpublished work and must not contain any third-party logos, trademarks, photographic images, or copyrighted materials. WCS will add the official Run for the Wild logo.  The Wildlife Conservation Society works around the globe to save wildlife and wild places. Changing climate, overfishing, and habitat loss are some of the factors affecting penguin populations. Of the world's 17 penguin species, 12 are experiencing serious population declines with some facing extinction within the 21st century. WCS is committed to ensuring a future for penguins where they live, including Punta Tombo on the coast of Argentina, home to the largest colony of Magellanic penguins in the world.  This event is expected to sell out, so register early. For more information, to register, or to sponsor a runner/team, visit www.wcs.runforthewild.org.
