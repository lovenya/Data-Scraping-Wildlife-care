 Flushing, N.Y. – Aug. 10, 2012 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Queens Zoo staff has chosen “Rose” as the name for the Texas Longhorn calf born in May. The name was selected from a pool of more than 500 names submitted online. 
 
 Rose was approximately 60 pounds at birth and is growing quickly. She will reach maturity at 8 years old. As an adult, her horns can reach a width of up to six feet from tip to tip. 
 
 Including Rose, there are three Texas longhorns at the Queens Zoo. They are located on the zoo’s farm with Scottish highland cattle, adjacent to the Jacob's sheep exhibit.
