This year, I'm pleased to see that, beyond the usual sharks-as-monsters themes, the week includes the birth of shark pups (whose long gestation shares much in common with humans') and natural phenomena like bioluminescence. However, in the coming years I hope the network will build upon such stories to look at some of the conservation challenges facing these extraordinary — and extraordinarily threatened — species. 

Sharks, rays and chimeras belong to a diverse group of more than 1,000 cartilaginous fishes. Many are being overfished today, in some instances to the point of extinction.
