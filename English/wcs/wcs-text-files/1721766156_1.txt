						The Bronx Zoo officially flipped the switch on Holiday Lights 2020 which will run on select dates November 20 to January 10, bringing New Yorkers much-needed joy for the winter season. Tickets for Holiday Lights must be purchased in advance and are now available online. This year’s experience will encompass a larger area of the zoo and be organized to accommodate social distancing. With dozens more animal lanterns than last year, the zoo has created five geographically representative lantern safaris that include species from different regions of the world. In addition to the wildlife lantern safaris and sprawling holiday illuminations, the new Luminous Garden will feature larger-than-life plants and animals unlike any other garden in New York including flowers, mushrooms, butterflies and other insects. Entertainment will include ice carving demonstrations, costumed characters, stilt walkers, souvenirs, and seasonal treats. Of course, s’mores have been so popular, the event will have 12 fire pits where people can make their own s’mores or try one of contest winners. While celebrating the holiday season, all events and activities have been modified to meet all safety guidelines as directed by the State of New York. All guests over 3 years old are required to socially distance and wear face coverings, and all tickets are date-specific and must be purchased in advance online.
