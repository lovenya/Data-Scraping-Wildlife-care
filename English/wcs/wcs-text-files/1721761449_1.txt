 Bronx, NY – Nov. 25, 2013 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo’s Salute to Wildlife Ice Carving Celebration is back for the holiday season.. The week-long celebration, running from Thursday, Dec 26 – Tuesday, Dec. 31 features professional ice carving demonstrations, wildlife-themed ice sculpture displays, an interactive play area, and the popular Salute to Wildlife Ice Carving Contest. 

    Professional ice carvers will demonstrate their ice carving skills by creating icy representations of animals native to Arctic Beringia – an area that spans from Russia across Alaska into Northwest Canada. The region’s tundra, coastal, and marine habitats are home to polar bears, whales, seals, muskoxen, arctic foxes and caribou and more, and these carvings will highlight the conservation work WCS is doing in the area.  

 The featured event of the week-long ice carving festival will be the Salute to Wildlife Ice Carving Contest on Saturday, December 28. The carvers will be judged by popular vote in categories including most lifelike, best in theme, and overall favorite. 

 Additional activities include animal enrichment activities, crafts, an ice play area featuring a giant polar bear ice slide, and lifelike animal displays all carved out of solid ice. Toy Soldiers on Parade – a high-energy holiday carol trio – will provide entertainment as they sing and dance fully costumed as toy soldiers.
