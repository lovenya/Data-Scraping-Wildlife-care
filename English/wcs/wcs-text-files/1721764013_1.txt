						Media Statement   WCS Praises New Regional Ocean Action Plan Made by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Planning Body   This week’s decision by the White House’s National Ocean Council  marks an important step for balancing marine wildlife and sustainable human use in ocean waters of New York, New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic   Bronx, N.Y. – Dec. 12, 2016 – The following statement was issued by WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs John Calvelli at the Wildlife Conservation Society:   “Today marks an important step in the ongoing process of conserving our ocean in the Mid-Atlantic region.  The Wildlife Conservation Society praises the White House’s National Ocean Council for certifying a new ocean plan that will ensure the sustainable use of our local ocean.   “We applaud government leaders of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Planning Body for developing the region’s first-ever ocean action plan.  This action plan takes into account our many uses of our ocean, including among others shipping, fishing, energy development, and wild-viewing, while balancing their impacts on marine wildlife and their habitats.    “There are many others to thank, too. As part of a broad coalition, WCS supporters and visitors to WCS’s New York Aquarium, Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, and many WCS members throughout the region submitted more than 5,000 letters, petitions, videos, and drawings voicing their support for ocean planning during the public comment period earlier this year.   “WCS is committed to protecting local waters through its NY Seascape program based at WCS’s New York Aquarium. The program’s goal is to restore healthy populations of local marine species and protect their aquatic habitats.”   *Special Note: WCS marine experts are available to discuss this and other marine-related stories.
