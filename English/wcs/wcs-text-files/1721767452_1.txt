Please join us for NYC’s must-see holiday tradition, Bronx Zoo Holiday Lights, which returns bigger and brighter than ever, transforming 12 acres of the zoo into a winter wonderland with hundreds of thousands of sparkling lights.

Also NEW this year: Immerse yourself in the Enchanted Sea, celebrating bioluminescent creatures, where kids of all ages can interact with LED swings, interactive floor projections, and ocean-themed interactive light panels. 

Returning entertainment favorites include ice-carving demonstrations, illuminated performers, kids’ favorite holiday train, Wildlife Theater, seasonal treats, and more.
