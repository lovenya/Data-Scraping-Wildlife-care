Flushing, N.Y. – Oct. 30, 2015 – Three burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) have made their debut at the WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) Queens Zoo.
 
The trio of owls is all female. They share their exhibit with thick-billed parrots and roadrunners.
 
Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are awake and active during the day. They use their exceptional vision and hearing when they night to hunt.
 
Burrowing owls excavate holes in the ground for breeding and nesting. The owls are known to sometimes take over existing burrows created by prairie dogs or other ground-dwelling animals.
 
The species once ranged throughout the American West, but its population is declining due to habitat destruction for land development. The species can also be found in Florida and Central and South America.
