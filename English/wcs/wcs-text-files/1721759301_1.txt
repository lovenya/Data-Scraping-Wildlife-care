Bronx, NY – June 1, 2011 – Attached photo: The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo
recently welcomed a new Przewalski's horse foal.  Born in May, the new horse
can be seen with the rest of the herd in the Wild Asia exhibit from the zoo’s
monorail. Przewalski's horses, which are also known as Mongolian wild horses,
were once extinct in the wild. Small populations of zoo-bred animals were
reintroduced in China in 1989 and in Mongolia starting in 1992. The
Przewalski's horse has never been domesticated.
