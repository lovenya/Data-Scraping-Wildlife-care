Jim Breheny, Bronx Zoo Director and WCS Senior Vice President of Living Institutions: “The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, Queens Zoo and New York Aquarium, will be closed Saturday and Sunday in anticipation of Hurricane Irene. We have taken steps to secure our parks and have taken appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our animals and staff. Our inventories are fully stocked, and we have sufficient supplies to last through the storm. We will update the media and the public as needed.”
