Brooklyn, NY, September 2, 2009 - The New York Aquarium is sad to report
that Pacific walrus, Akituusaq, died September 1. The walrus died due to
complications from pneumonia.

During
the past few days, Akituusaq had
been under special care by Wildlife Conservation Society veterinarians and
received round-the-clock attention. Working tirelessly, WCS staff closely
monitored his status and provided dedicated medical care.

"We
are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved walrus Akituusaq and are proud
of the exemplary care that our entire staff provided during this critical
time,” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, New York Aquarium Director. “We
know Brooklyn
was proud of Akituusaq and many loved him. This is a loss to the whole
community.”

Akituusaq
was the first Pacific walrus baby born in the New York Aquarium’s 113-year
history. This past spring he celebrated his second birthday. He was born
June 12, 2007. Walrus births in aquariums are very rare, with only five surviving
to one year of age.Contact: Fran Hackett, 718-265-3428 fhackett@wcs.org
