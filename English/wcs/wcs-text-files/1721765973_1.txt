						A WCS partnership, the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP), is inviting applications to its 2021 Conservation Team Awards, offering early-career conservationists around the world a chance to gain project funding as well as professional training, mentorship and networking opportunities. Applications must be submitted by 23 October 2020 at CLP’s online application portal.  For 35 years, CLP has been helping early-career conservationists gain experience, confidence, and a support network in the conservation sector worldwide. The annual CLP Team Awards aim to identify, recognize and empower these rising stars in conservation who are leading vital projects to save globally threatened species.  A long-held priority for CLP is to build a diverse network of conservation leaders comprising nationals mainly from developing countries. Awardees are encouraged to develop projects and conservation actions that are culturally appropriate, and inclusive of all relevant perspectives and stakeholders. CLP training courses are a space where diversity is celebrated and where all voices are heard and valued.  “As WCS sustains and expands our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion across the organization, we are proud to be a partner of the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP),” said Cristián Samper, WCS President and CEO. “Through the CLP Team Awards, internships, training, and alumni network support, this program is playing a key role in the diversification of the conservation sector, which is a necessary shift we all must support to make this work more equitable, inclusive, and effective.” The CLP Conservation Team Awards are granted to teams undertaking high-priority conservation projects that involve research as well as practical actions and community outreach to promote local pro-conservation views and achieve effective, long-lasting conservation solutions. Eligible applicants can apply for three types of award offering different funding amounts:  Future Conservationist Awards (up to USD 15,000 per project) Conservation Follow-Up Awards (up to USD 25,000 per project; available only to previous recipients of a Future Conservationist Award)  Conservation Leadership Award (up to USD 50,000 per project; available only to previous recipients of a Follow-Up Award) Applicants must undertake projects that target species listed as Data Deficient, Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered on the global IUCN Red List. Projects are not eligible if they take place in countries designated as high-income economies by the World Bank, with the exception of some countries and island nations in Latin America & the Caribbean and the Pacific. More information on eligibility requirements and application guidelines can be found on the CLP website. The award-winners are expected to be announced in April 2021.  The 2021 CLP Conservation Team Awards are possible due to generous support from Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin (arcadiafund.org.uk). ###BirdLife International BirdLife International is the world’s largest nature conservation Partnership, with 116 BirdLife Partners in 113 countries.
