This Caribbean flamingo at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo splashes as it bathes in the aquatic birds exhibit.  Flamingos are very social, feeding together during the day. Born white, flamingoes do not get their trademark pink feathers until they are one to three years of age. The adult's rich color comes from pigments in the food that the birds eat.  They spend up to one third of their day preening to ensure their feathers stay waterproof.  



Caribbean flamingoes enjoying the warmer temperatures is one of many exciting things to see this spring.  WCS's Bronx Zoo will be kicking off the season with Animal Tales Extravaganza; every weekend in April, May, and June will be packed with family-oriented entertainment.  And don't miss the second annual Run for the Wild on Saturday, April 24th at WCS's Bronx Zoo.
