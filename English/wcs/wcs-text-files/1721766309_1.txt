The spring tradition was held virtually in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the event was reimagined for 2021 to meet city and state social distancing, safety, and capacity protocols. More than 4,100 took part in the in-person event this morning at the Bronx Zoo. All were welcome to enjoy the zoo for the entire day which was open only to participating runners and walkers. The event was a little different this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Among the changes for this year:  Two starting locations for runners and walkers:   10 heats and staggered start times.  Limited capacity to allow for social distancing Each year the WCS Run for the Wild is dedicated to an animal in need of conservation support to raise awareness of threats they face. This year the event is dedicated to lemurs and will help WCS raise important funds to further its mission of saving wildlife in New York and around the world. Runners, walkers, and wildlife supporters are invited to participate and/or make a donation to support a participating runner or team. Each participant is encouraged to seek donations and there are prizes for achieving the fundraising goals. There is a $35 minimum fundraising requirement (plus registration) for all participants 16 years of age and older.
