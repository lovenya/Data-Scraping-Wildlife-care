Today at 11 AM US Eastern Time, @TheWCS and @WCSTanzania will release an extremely rare pic of a baby kipunji Rungwecebus kipunji on Twitter.  This is Africa's rarest monkey, first discovered by WCS in 2003 and described as a new genus in 2006.  The monkey lives in a protected forest on Mt. Rungwe that WCS helped create two years after the species was first discovered.  The baby is part of a habituated group WCS has been following for the past four years.  Its mother lost its hand and lower arm in a snare before the forest was safeguarded, but it can still properly care for its new baby according to the researchers following it. With only 1,100 animals in total, the species is listed as Critically Endangered. Every birth makes a difference.
