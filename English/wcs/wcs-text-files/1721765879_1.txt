						Bronx, NY – May 29, 2020 – The gaur (Bos gaurus) herd at the Bronx Zoo has grown by seven calves (two males; five females) since the addition of a new breeding male in 2018. The arrival of the bull from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and its introduction to the herd at the Bronx Zoo was a featured story during season three of THE ZOO on Animal Planet (8PM ET/PT). Tomorrow’s all-new episode will include an update on the breeding program and give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the calves. Two of the female calves were born since the Bronx Zoo temporarily closed to the public on March 16 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The herd currently consists of 25 animals. The Bronx Zoo has the only gaur breeding program in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Click HERE for video of the herd in their Wild Asia exhibit at the Bronx Zoo. Gaur are native to Southeast Asia and are largest wild cattle species in the world. Males are larger than females and can grow to 11 feet in length and weigh more than 2,200 pounds. The species is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and populations are decreasing due to human activity.
