NEW YORK, NY (May 28, 2024) -- Subsequent to a necropsy at the Bronx Zoo, the wings and tissue samples from Flaco, a Eurasian eagle owl, were transferred to the American Museum of Natural History to become part of its scientific collection. Historically, the Bronx Zoo has donated specimens to the Museum. These collections are used extensively by scientists and also by artists who develop images for educational materials, including birding field guides. The remains will not be on public view. The remainder of Flaco’s remains have been archived at the Bronx Zoo’s Wildlife Health Center. The tissue samples transferred to the Museum are for its frozen tissue specimen collection. Postmortem testing results can be found HERE.
