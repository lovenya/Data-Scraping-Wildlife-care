						North Carolina Zoo and Wildlife Conservation Society’s Collaborative International Conservation Program Recognized with National AwardContact: Rob Vernon, AZA, 301.244.3352; rvernon@aza.org  Gavin Johnson, North Carolina Zoo; 336-879-7202; gavin.johnson@nczoo.orgMax Pulsinelli, WCS/Bronx Zoo; 718-220-5182; mpulsinelli@wcs.orgSeptember 30, 2015 – The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) announced that the North Carolina Zoo and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) received AZA’s 2015 Significant Achievement in International Conservation Award for their program to conserve the Critically Endangered Cross River Gorilla. This annual award recognizes exceptional efforts toward regional habitat preservation, species restoration, and support of biodiversity in the wild. “Conservation is a high priority for the North Carolina Zoo, WCS and its zoos and aquarium in New York, and all AZA-accredited aquariums and zoos,” said President and CEO Jim Maddy. “As the North Carolina Zoo and WCS Cross River Gorilla conservation program also serves as a model for other institutions, it is receiving this award for the direct, positive impact these organizations are making on the future of the world’s wildlife.” The Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), classified as Critically Endangered, occurs in an environment where the threats posed by bushmeat hunting, conversion of forest for agriculture and small-scale logging are significant. In 2008, North Carolina Zoo and WCS implemented a mobile computer-based monitoring system across the range of the Cross River gorilla to assess both threats to the gorillas and the impact of law enforcement activities. This system, in tandem with a program of anti-poaching patrols, field surveys and community outreach, has allowed the NC Zoo and WCS staff to quantitatively measure threat, protection and biological data relevant for gorilla and wildlife conservation. These data demonstrate that since the inception of the project they have been able to significantly increase levels of protection, reduce threats, and maintain stability of wildlife populations. The Cross River landscape is one of the few locations in tropical Africa where such conservation success has been documented. While effective conservation of the gorillas and their habitat encountered, and continues to encounter, logistical, technical and political challenges, the system has proved an invaluable tool in assessing the effectiveness of Cross River gorilla conservation.  “Conservation is an integral part of the mission of today’s zoos and aquariums,” said Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President, General Director WCS Zoos and Aquarium, and AZA Board member. “The partnership between WCS’s Africa Program and the North Carolina Zoo is helping save these majestic creatures in the wild while we continue to raise awareness of the conservation needs through innovative exhibitry like the Bronx Zoo’s Congo Gorilla Forest which has raised more than $12.5 million since opening in 1999.” Lessons learned in the course of developing this approach to conservation program monitoring have subsequently been expanded and applied to other conservation initiatives. This project is also a good example of how smaller and larger institutions can effectively partner to achieve positive conservation outcomes. Additionally, the project is an example of how AZA-accredited facilities can positively affect the conservation of one of the species selected for the new AZA: SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) initiative. “The long-term engagement of both NC Zoo and WCS in Cross River gorilla conservation is an excellent example of how zoos can work together to save species from extinction. By bringing together a broad range of expertise and resources, our partnership has helped to preserve not only the Cross River gorilla, but also the many other plant and animal species who share their forest home,” said Pat Simmons, director of the North Carolina Zoo. The mission of the North Carolina Zoo is to encourage understanding of and commitment to the conservation of the world's wildlife and wild places. This is accomplished by developing, maintaining and operating a major natural habitat zoological park that provides a meaningful and accessible recreational and educational outlet for citizens and tourists. Located in Asheboro, North Carolina, the Zoo provides unique educational opportunities for the state's teachers, students and the general public, participates in local and international conservation projects, models sustainable practices and conducts research concerning plants, animals and biological communities in conjunction with the scientific community. The North Carolina Zoo is open 364 days a year, closed on Christmas, offering 500 acres of exhibits with special events year round. Visit www.nczoo.org for more information. The North Carolina Zoo is an agency of the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, Susan Kluttz, Secretary; Pat McCrory, Governor.
