Brooklyn, New York – Aug. 6, 2010 – Tazo, an orphaned northern sea otter pup found stranded this summer in Homer, Alaska, has safely arrived at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium. Tazo was found alone and dehydrated after he was separated from his mother during a storm. He was rescued by the Alaskan SeaLife Center in Seward. The two-month old pup arrived safely and is in quarantine at the New York Aquarium. He will be bottle-fed a special sea otter formula and receive round-the-clock care until he can be weaned and goes into his new home in the aquarium’s sea otter exhibit later this year.  Without his mother, Tazo would not have survived in the wild.
