Penguins fly and albatross don't really.



In their southern world, dominated by wind and ice and water, penguins fly in the water while albatross rarely power their flight; they glide.

Since then, I have updated my notes on that wondrous part of the world as I have become aware of new studies of these birds and their changing environment.



Antarctica wasn't always cold and remote from the rest of the world. It was part of the great southern continent block, Gondwana, binding what would become Australia, South America, Africa, and India together.
