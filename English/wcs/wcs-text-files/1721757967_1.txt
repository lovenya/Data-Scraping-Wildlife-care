The Wildlife Conservation Society mourns the loss of Senior
Conservation Scientist Dr. John Thorbjarnarson, who died suddenly on
February 14th in India. John was a world-renowned expert on crocodiles,
alligators, anacondas, turtles and other species of reptiles and worked
tirelessly throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia to ensure their
protection and conservation. His deep commitment to conservation and
wry sense of humor will be missed by all who knew John. All of us at
WCS were inspired by his dedication and spirit through the many years
we had the honor to work with him.
With the generous support of John Thorbjarnarson's family, WCS has established a memorial fund in John's honor to promote the conservation of the world's endangered crocodilians.  Donations for the fund can be made online, or can be mailed to:
