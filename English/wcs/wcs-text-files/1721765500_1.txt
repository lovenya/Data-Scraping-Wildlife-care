Between now and Sept. 15, Bronx Zoo Holiday Lights tickets purchased online will be discounted by 30 percent; 40 percent for members. Plan for the busy season in advance then celebrate the holiday season with an enchanting adventure for the entire family. For the first time since 2007, the Bronx Zoo is bringing back the celebrated holiday tradition with dazzling light displays that will cover and sparkle acres of the zoo. Visitors will be able to walk-through the zoo to experience wildlife-themed LED displays, custom Asian lanterns, animated light shows on the historic Astor Court and more. “We are bringing an updated version of a beloved holiday tradition back to the Bronx Zoo for the first time since 2007,” said John F. Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. “The LED lights, animal-themed lanterns, and animated light shows will be set amongst the historic buildings on an expanded footprint that will take people throughout the zoo. The LED technology will also allow us be incredibly energy efficient. We believe our visitors will come away really enjoying this “green” Holiday experience.” Entertainment and activities will include holiday-themed music performances, caroling, ice-carving demonstrations, train rides, and seasonal treats including hot chocolate, smores, and much more. Tickets for the Bronx Zoo Holiday Lights (before the savings) are priced at $29.95 for adults, $22.95 for children, and $28.95 for seniors.
