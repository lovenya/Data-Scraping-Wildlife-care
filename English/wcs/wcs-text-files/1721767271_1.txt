						WCS’s Queens Zoo has debuted a tiny southern pudu fawn, which is just over a month old and currently weighs a little more than five-and-a-half pounds. Pudu are the smallest deer in the world, with an adult weighing between 15 and 20 pounds. Native to Chile and Argentina, southern pudu are listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. As part of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums Species Survival Plan, the Queens Zoo has been successfully breeding pudu for over ten years and currently has three. Stop by soon to spot this diminutive deer on the Queens Zoo’s Wild Side trail.
