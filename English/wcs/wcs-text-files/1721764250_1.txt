						DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA (MAY 10, 2017) â€“ A new elite team of WCS-trained wildlife rangers in Tanzania graduated on May 6th and will be deployed in the Ruaha-Katavi Landscape, which harbors East Africa's largest elephant population. Ruaha-Katavi now has three such elite units to fight poachers. These units benefit from both aerial and boat support and also will be receiving three custom-designed field vehicles. The event was attended by: Director General TAWA (Tanzania Wildlife Authority) Matin Loibooki and Assistant Director (Protection) Faustine Masalu, along with the District Commission from Nkasi District, and game reserve managers and rangers from nearby Katavi National Park. USAID provides ongoing support for this work. PHOTO CREDIT: Aaron Nicholas/WCS Hi res available here
