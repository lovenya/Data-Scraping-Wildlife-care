Message to Coney Island Polar Bear Club: THIS is how it’s done
		 

		

		
New York, NY, December 30, 2010- Just like the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, the real polar bears at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo relish winter swims.  

 

The famous Central Park Zoo polar bears can be seen in the Polar Circle area of the zoo alongside a harbor seal, puffins, and three species of penguin.

 

The Wildlife Conservation Society works around the globe to combat the effects of climate change that is affecting everything from marine life to polar bears.
