												Bronx, NY – Aug. 22, 2012 –Two male southern white rhinoceroses are making their debut at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo.   The two rhinos are three-and-a-half-year-old brothers and weigh about 4000 pounds. They are not fully grown and could weigh over 7,000 pounds as adult bulls. They each consume about 50 pounds of hay and herbivore pellets a day. They were brought to the Bronx Zoo from The Wilds (Cumberland, Ohio) where they were born.   There are five species of rhinoceros in the world. White and black rhinos are native to Africa, while Sumatran, greater one-horned, and Javan rhinos are found in Asia. The Bronx Zoo exhibits two species; the southern white rhinos can be seen at Zoo Center, and the greater one-horned rhinoceros, Indian rhino, can be seen from the Wild Asia Monorail.    The rhino’s horn is comprised entirely of keratin – the same substance that makes up hair and nails.   Illegal poaching of rhinos for their horns is the greatest threat facing these animals. The white rhino is the only rhino species that is not listed as endangered, although the increased threat of poaching for the illegal sale of rhino horns threatens the future of these iconic animals. The Wildlife Conservation Society works throughout Africa to save wildlife and wild places, and the Sumatran rhinoceros is one of the species WCS is working to save in Asia.
