Update: Thanks to the more than 500 volunteers who participated in the 2010 loon census on July 17. Volunteers survey more than 300 lakes and ponds, up from 200 last year.
As part of an effort to better understand the status, structure and threats to the regional loon population, WCS initiated the loon census in 2001. One of the major findings of the 2010 census: The Adirondack loon population has almost doubled since the last pre-census analysis in the 1980s and now totals some 1,500–2,000 birds.

About the CensusOn the third Saturday of July, WCS conducts an annual loon census with the help of local Adirondack residents and visitor volunteers. This data provides a quick glimpse of the status of the breeding loon population in and around the Adirondack Park and across New York State. The results help guide management decisions and policies that affect loons. Observations made elsewhere in New York State are also welcome. Census volunteers sign up to monitor a lake from 8:00–9:00 a.m. on the census day, and report the number of adult loons, chicks, and immature loons they observe. Similar loon censuses are also conducted in other states throughout the Northeast at the same time on the same day, contributing to a thorough regional overview of the population’s current status.Volunteers will need to download the Lake Selection Table, the 2010 Loon Census Instructions, and fill out the 2010 Loon Census Form.
