The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is proud to announce conservation biologist Dr. John Weaver as the winner of the Wilburforce Foundation’s Conservation Leadership Award. The award recognizes Weaver’s many years of field research and conservation efforts in several areas of the Yellowstone-to-Yukon region. 

Most recently, Weaver conducted pioneering field studies on grizzly bears, Dall’s sheep, and woodland caribou in the remote area surrounding Nahanni National Park, a World Heritage Site in the Northwest Territories of Canada. His research and recommendations provided the scientific basis for the sevenfold expansion of the park in 2009. Thanks to his leadership, Nahanni is nearly four times larger than Yellowstone National Park and now ranks as the sixth largest national park in the world. 

The Wilburforce Foundation focuses on wildlife and wild lands protection  throughout western North America. Jennifer Miller, an officer with the group’s Yellowstone-to-Yukon Program, stated, “John’s research has highlighted the ecological values of key North American landscapes. We are honored to present this award to John as a way of recognizing his passion, commitment, and exemplary efforts in the field of conservation.”  

Weaver has worked at WCS since the mid-1990s. He has played a key role in conservation of wolves, grizzly bears, and wild cats in the U.S. and Canada and has authored numerous scientific publications.
