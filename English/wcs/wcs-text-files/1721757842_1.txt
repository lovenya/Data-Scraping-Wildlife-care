Immediate Call for High School Student Participants (Ages 14 - 17)
Application Deadline: Friday, December 11th, 2009  Brooklyn, NY – The New York Aquarium Teen Conservation Program’s Careers in Aquatic Research and Education (CARE) is a unique winter opportunity designed to introduce early high school students from various backgrounds and occupational interests to the vast and interdisciplinary nature of careers in the aquatic sciences and related fields, with a focus on careers options at living institutions such as the Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium. Interns will participate in a 10-day program where they will learn about the multi-faceted discipline of aquatic science and have the opportunity to interact with experts in various disciplines. While exposure to career opportunities in aquatic science and related fields will be the focus of the CARE program, participants will be involved also in several skill-building activities in order to prepare them for their career choices ahead. Activities will include, but will not be limited to: public speaking, bibliography generation, field observation and recording, basic research strategies, and presentation creation.   This is an unpaid internship program.  CARE interns must commit to participating in this 50-hour program, which will take place over the course of 10 days (Saturdays and a few weekdays) from January 16, 2010 to March 6th, 2010.
