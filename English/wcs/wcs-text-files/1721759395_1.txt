Since boyhood, Ben Han has witnessed sharp declines of amphibians in his patch of the world, a stretch of lush and misty mountains on the borderlands of China and Vietnam. He’s now on a mission to uncover what’s happening to the region’s wildlife. His eye is on one distinctive hopper in particular: the moustache toad. Facing threats of hunting and pollution, the future for these toads is fragile, according to Han. Since 2007, his research team won grant awards totaling $42,500 from the Conservation Leadership Program (CLP), a partnership between WCS and three other wildlife organizations that supports young scientists across the globe. Ben's work is one of 30 projects in 19 countries that received a 2011 CLP Conservation Award.
