"Today sends a signal. Mozambique will not tolerate poachers, traffickers and the organised criminals which employ and pay them to kill our wildlife and threaten our communities." said Minister Correia, after setting ablaze the pyre in central Maputo. He also said, "The ivory trade is driven by those beyond our shores but it is our citizens and our neighbours who pay the cost. In May, Government-led surveys undertaken in partnership with WCS as part of the larger Great Elephant Census showed a dramatic 48 per cent decline in Mozambique's elephant population in just the last five years. In Mozambique these surveys were funded by Paul G. Allen, USAID, and WCS. Mozambique lost its last rhino in 2013. The survey results and Mozambique's reputation as a known trafficking route for illegal trade have driven the Government's determination to act. In a sophisticated operation, Mozambican police recently seized 1.3 tons of ivory and rhino horn (65 pieces) in Matola - the largest amount of ivory seized in the country's history, and the largest ever rhino horn seizure. That seizure was part of what was destroyed today. On 22 May 2015 twelve of these rhino horns were stolen from the police warehouse, prompting the President of Mozambique, Filipe Nyussi, to remark “When policemen are caught in the gangs trafficking in rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, and various drugs, or facilitate these same crimes, I am unable to sleep.” At least four policemen have been arrested in connection with this theft and a senior Provincial police commander has been implicated in local press. “This event demonstrates the Republic's commitment to protecting its natural resources, and its zero-tolerance to poaching, trafficking and to the organised criminals behind this” said Dr Bartolomeu Soto, the Director-General of ANAC, in his letter announcing the event. “Carlos Lopes Pereira, Head of Law Enforcement and Anti-poaching for ANAC, said: "To reverse this situation, concerted action is needed right now - not in five years' time. Today's action is an important step in permanently putting ivory and horn beyond economic use, where it cannot leak into the black market. It follows a detailed inventory and management review in which samples were taken for DNA analysis. It also highlights the good work being done in prosecuting criminals under our new stronger wildlife laws." Alastair Nelson, the country director for WCS, who supported the inventory said “This shows a commitment from the leadership of Mozambique to tackle wildlife crime, associated corruption and organised criminal gangs. Mozambique’s new environmental police unit and the new law offer a real opportunity for change. In Niassa Reserve, where 7,500 elephant have been poached in three years we are working hand-in-hand with Government to combat poaching and strengthen law enforcement. The stand taken by Mozambique today gives us hope.” New measures to combat this wildlife crime in Mozambique include: ·         A new law the criminalises poaching and trafficking, ·         Deploying the new Mozambican environmental police unit to work with ANAC scouts to implement the new law and stop poaching and illegal logging, ·         Developing intelligence-led law enforcement capability, and improving training, equipping and leadership of protected-area scouts, including establishing specialist units that are properly equipped and armed, ·         Strengthening partnerships with international organizations, ·         Working with WCS and Stop Ivory to inventory ivory stocks, ·         MoU’s signed with Tanzania on 25 May 2015, and with South Africa in 2014, to strengthen cross-border collaboration to tackle poaching and trafficking. Alexander Rhodes, CEO of Stop Ivory, said "The figures released earlier this year baldly chalk up the imminent total liquidation of Mozambique's famous elephant populations.  The concept of the vast wilderness of Niassa without elephants is like an international rugby match without prop forwards: absurd, broken and unsustainable.  We are delighted to have been able to share with ANAC the expertise and experience of ivory inventory and management we have accrued working with WCS and other partners in many countries across Africa.  "We are delighted to be working with ANAC in partnership with WCS, in particular sharing our considerable expertise and experience in ivory inventory, governance and management.  In line with our support of the Elephant Protection Initiative, we strongly commend the Government's actions today and look forward to assisting with its efforts to implement the African Elephant Action plan." This destruction adds Mozambique's voice to the growing worldwide consensus that a future for elephants and rhinos is incompatible with trade in ivory and horn.  In the last three months the USA, the Republic of Congo, China, and UAE have all publicly destroyed their ivory stocks. The inventory and this destruction results will be officially reported to CITES.
