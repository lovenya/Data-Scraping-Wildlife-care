				Bronx, NY- June 12, 2009—The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its landmark exhibit and habitat, Congo Gorilla Forest.
		The exhibit, which has won numerous design awards, has raised nearly $10 million for conservation efforts through its 6.6 million visitors who donate their admission fees to protect gorillas, elephants, mandrills, and other flagship species. With these funds, WCS has worked to establish the first system of national parks in the Central African nation of Gabon, as well as create other protected areas in the vast Congo Basin. Last year, WCS scientists announced the discovery of 125,000 western lowland gorillas in the Republic of Congo. WCS works in more than 20 African nations to protect wildlife and wild lands.
		To mark the 10-year anniversary, WCS’ Bronx Zoo is hosting activities that highlight the impact it has had on visitors and on WCS conservation efforts in the Congo region of Africa.
		The celebratory activities are on Fridays and Saturdays for five weeks beginning the weekend of June 19h and 20th and extending through July 17th and 18th.
		The Congo Gorilla Forest Event Activities are sponsored by Bank of America.
