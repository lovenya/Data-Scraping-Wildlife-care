						KRAKOW, POLAND (July 3, 2017) WCS released today a position statement for the 41st session of the World Heritage Committee (41COM), currently being held in Krakow, Poland from through 12 July 2017.  This statement relates primarily to natural and mixed World Heritage sites that are on the 41COM agenda, at which WCS has a presence, and where we are working with the State Party concerned to support the management and protection of the property in question. WCS is currently working on the ground to support the protection of 32 natural and mixed World Heritage sites around the world. In some sites, we partner with States Parties in the direct management of protected areas. In others, we offer technical expertise for scientific monitoring, engage in capacity building for protected area managers, and provide other forms of support tailored to the specific needs of individual sites and countries. We are working at eight of the 19 natural and mixed sites inscribed on the World Heritage Sites in Danger list; we are working to conserve several other sites under review, and we also work in two of the sites that have been nominated for inscription as World Heritage.
