						NEW YORK (December 30, 2014) – WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) released today ten favorite camera trap images of 2014 taken by its scientists from around the world.  WCS uses camera traps as a non-invasive tool to estimate wildlife populations and species diversity in many of the wild places where it works.
