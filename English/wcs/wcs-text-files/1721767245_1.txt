The following statement was issued today by the Wildlife Conservation Society:

Due to the continuing air quality alert in New York City and concern for our staff, visitors and animals, our four zoos and our aquarium -- Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, New York Aquarium -- will remain closed. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene continue to recommend limiting outdoor activities and to stay inside when possible. Animals will remain indoors where possible. Our staff is taking precautions necessary for the animals, and we continue to monitor their health as always. At this time, no animals are showing adverse effects or having any issues related to the air quality. We thank all for understanding as we navigate through these challenging environmental conditions caused by the Canadian wildfires.
