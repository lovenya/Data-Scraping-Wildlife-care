These three African lion cubs at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo need names. Go to bronxzoo.com and help give them their identity. Here, the cubs playfully run around with each other, as mom, Sukari, and dad, M’wasi, closely watch. Born in January, these adorable cubs love exploring their African Plains exhibit. A recent study showed there are less than 29,000 lions left in Africa; most of these are living in protected areas and reserves.  WCS conservation field staff is on the ground working to protect wildlife and these wild lands in Africa and around the world. 

 

WCS’s Bronx Zoo is asking the public to help name the one male and two female cubs. Go to www.bronxzoo.com to submit your names and vote on the finalists before midnight May 8, this Saturday night.

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony. WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
