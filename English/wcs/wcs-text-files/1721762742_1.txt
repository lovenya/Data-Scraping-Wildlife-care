Transformation of Children’s Zoo at the Bronx Zoo sponsored by Canon U.S.A. Bronx, NY – May 27, 2015 – The Children’s Zoo at WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) Bronx Zoo has undergone a renovation and is officially reopening on Saturday, May 30 with a weekend-long celebration. “Originally opened at the Bronx Zoo in 1941, the Children’s Zoo is a historic part of any visit to the Bronx Zoo,” said Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director. “The Children’s Zoo is an experience people remember from their childhoods and represents many people’s first up-close encounter with wild animals. The new Children’s Zoo maintains the nostalgia from the past while creating new experiences and introducing a variety of different species to the exhibit.” Species new to the Children’s Zoo include giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), Linne’s Two- toed Sloth (Choloepus didactylus), South American coatimundi (Nasua nasua) and the world’s smallest deer: the pudu (Pudu puda). Other wildlife favorites returning to the children’s zoo include American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), and South American squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) which now live on an island habitat surrounded by wading Caribbean flamingoes (Phoenicopterus ruber) and other dabbing waterfowl. The exhibit improvements are substantial, but maintain the walk-through trail experience and key features such as the aviary, prairie dog tunnels, bird nests, turtle shells, and tree house slide that have become iconic and a source of nostalgia for many. WCS worked with author/ artist Brendan Wenzel on the new whimsically illustrated interpretive graphics that identify species, provide key facts about the animals, and educate about the species’ conservation needs in the wild. He will be on-site all weekend to sign his new book, Some Bugs. The Children’s Zoo will officially re-open on Saturday, May 30 with a weekend-long celebration. As part of the festivities, Peppa Pig, the world-famous star of the hit animated TV series airing daily on Nick Jr., will join families for a weekend full of fun at the zoo. Peppa will be greeting fans for photo opportunities on Saturday, May 30, and Sunday, May 31, at 11:30 am, 1:30 pm and 3:30 pm. In addition, kids can create their own Peppa mask and pick up a free bookmark (while supplies last) upon entering the zoo. Kipps Bay Boys and Girls Club, BombaYo Afro-Puerto Rican Youth Project, and Casita Maria Chorus from The Bronx will each perform music and dance numbers all weekend and to celebrate the grand re-opening. Between 11am and 3pm on May 30 and May 31, WCS’s Education Department will host “Children’s Zoo Quests” and the “Adventure Club” for kids and families, presented by Canon U.S.A. These daytime guided tours run every half hour, and will continue through November 1 on weekends, Wednesdays, and holidays. Canon has generously sponsored the transformation of the Children’s Zoo, including the enhanced animal exhibits, colorful updated graphics, and innovative play experiences.
