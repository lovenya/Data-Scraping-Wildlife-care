BOZEMAN (February 29, 2012) – A baby bear on stilts, perhaps?  Nope.  Conservationists with the Wildlife Conservation Society recently released this camera-trap photo of a wolverine retrieving bait placed in a tree in Montana. The frame upon which the animal climbs is designed so that the unique markings on the underside of the wolverine are revealed to the motion-sensing camera.   Scientists use these markings to identify individual animals and document their distribution and range. WCS’s eight-year study of wolverines in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has led to a better understanding of wolverine ecology and will help inform conservation strategies so that this rare species can survive despite the 21st century conservation challenges it faces. An estimated 250-300 wolverines remain in the “lower 48,” where they  occupy about half of their former range in high alpine peaks of the western United States.

  The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide.  We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo.  Together these activities change attitudes toward nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony.  WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
