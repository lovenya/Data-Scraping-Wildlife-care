						Bronx, NY – May 11, 2016 – WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) is bringing back the Bronx Zoo Birdathon on Saturday, May 14.  The Birdathon is a birding event during the peak of the spring migration season. This year’s Birdathon includes keeper chats, conservation experts, family activities, and a free-flying bird show presented by JetBlue Airways. The annual bird-watching event is open to birders of all skill levels, including families and novices. The Bronx Zoo is a birder’s paradise. The park sits on 265 acres of hardwood forest that is transected by the Bronx River – the only freshwater river in New York City. The diverse habitats and access to water make the zoo the perfect environment for dozens of migratory and resident bird species including warblers, vireos, thrushes, woodpeckers, ducks, wading birds, and more.  Many of these birds travel from as far away as South America and other areas of the tropics. Participants will receive a checklist of the bird species found in and around the zoo. Zoo staff will guide birders to areas of the zoo where they will most likely observe wild birds, and Bronx Zoo ornithology staff will be on hand to chat about how they care for birds at the zoo and work to save birds in the wild. Following the Birdathon activities, participants are encouraged enjoy the rest of the day at the Bronx Zoo and stop by Astor Court for “Birds in Flight” presented by JetBlue. Animal Behavior & Conservation Connections (ABCC) will be flying macaws, conures, falcons, hawks, vultures, owls and more to demonstrate their natural flight behaviors while the presenters teach onlookers about the conservation needs of the species. The live show will run twice a day at 11:30am and 2pm on weekends through June 19. Families can stop by the Dancing Crane Pavillion from 11am to 4pm where they can take a birdwatching lesson and learn to make their own binoculars – all in the spirit of the Birdathon celebration.
