						Coney Island, NY – May 2, 2017 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) New York Aquarium’s contest to design the new Education Hall mural along the Coney Island Boardwalk has moved on to the final public voting phase.    The aquarium asked local artists and art schools to submit designs that would raise awareness about the devastating effect of ocean plastics – the theme of this year’s World Oceans Day.    Of the 42 designs submitted, seven finalists have been chosen by a panel of judges for public vote. Those judges included: Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the New York Aquarium; Sue Chin, WCS Vice President of Planning and Design and Chief Architect; New York State Assemblywoman Pamela Harris; and Pam Pettyjohn, President of Coney Island Beautification Project. “We extend special thanks everyone who participated by submitting a mural design.” said Dohlin. “We received incredible submissions from artists all around the New York area who want to help transform our Education Hall boardwalk facade and inspire people to protect our waters. Now we need New Yorkers to help to choose the winner.” Anyone who wants to weigh in can see the seven design finalists and vote for their three favorites at www.nyaquarium.com/2017-mural-competition. The three winning designs will be installed and unveiled the week of World Ocean’s Day, June 8.   The issue of ocean plastic pollution is a growing problem-- and the theme of this year’s World Oceans Day. The New York Aquarium is working to inspire people to reduce the amount of plastic that makes its way to our oceans. More than eight million tons of plastic ends up in our rivers, streams and oceans, and are devastating to wildlife of all types. At the current rate, estimates indicate that the Earth’s oceans could contain more plastics than fish (by weight) by 2050.   Contest rules do apply.
