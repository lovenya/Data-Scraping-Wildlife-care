Three young, playful mountain coatimundi have a new home in the Tropic Zone exhibit at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo.  
Mountain coatis live in large groups in the mountains of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. They have long, flexible noses for sniffing and rooting out food from fallen leaves in the forest and they hold their striped tails up in the air while foraging.  

 

Coatis like to climb trees and are very acrobatic. These three males can often be seen bounding through the tree limbs in their exhibit and will engage with zoo-goers through the glass.Contact:

 The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild places worldwide. We do so through science, global conservation, education and the management of the world's largest system of urban wildlife parks, led by the flagship Bronx Zoo. Together these activities change attitudes towards nature and help people imagine wildlife and humans living in harmony.  WCS is committed to this mission because it is essential to the integrity of life on Earth.
