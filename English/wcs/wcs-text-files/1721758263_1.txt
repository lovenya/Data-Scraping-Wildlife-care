WHAT:                 
Topics for commentary: 

Critical habitats for whales (i.e. breeding grounds, feeding grounds, restricted migratory routes) need to be protected through effective national policies.Other factors such as climate change, habitat degradation, and marine pollution may also affect whale populations and need to be factored into the conservation and management decisions.The Southern Ocean Sanctuary (surrounding Antarctica) needs to be maintained by the IWC for the protection and recovery of whale populations in those waters.
