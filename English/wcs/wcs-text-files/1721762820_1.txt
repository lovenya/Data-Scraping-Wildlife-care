WASHINGTON (June 29, 2015) – The following statement was released today by WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs John Calvelli:
“The trade promotion authority legislation just signed by President Obama contains provisions that make holding U.S. trading partners accountable for enforcing their commitments under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and other multilateral environmental agreements principal negotiating objectives for future trade agreements.  WCS is heartened by the Obama Administration’s stated commitment to make environmental commitments fully enforceable in the core text of future agreements and believe this legislation now puts Congress on record as supporting the same goal. It is now the responsibility of the environmental community and the American public to hold them accountable for this promise.”###Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature. VISION: WCS envisions a world where wildlife thrives in healthy lands and seas, valued by societies that embrace and benefit from the diversity and integrity of life on earth. To achieve our mission, WCS, based at the Bronx Zoo, harnesses the power of its Global Conservation Program in more than 60 nations and in all the world’s oceans and its five wildlife parks in New York City,  visited by 4 million people annually.
