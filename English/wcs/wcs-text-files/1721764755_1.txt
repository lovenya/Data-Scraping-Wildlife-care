						The WCS’s (Wildlife Conservation Society) Queens Zoo and Prospect Park Zoo are celebrating the Year of the Dog with special activities to ring in the Lunar New Year.  Queens Zoo’s coyotes will be the featured canines for Lunar New Year activities on Saturday and Sunday, February 10 and 11. Activities include a self-guided, scavenger hunt, ribbon dancing, paper cutting and calligraphy workshops, story time, keeper chats, and other educational programming. Prospect Park Zoo’s resident canines, the dingos, will be the focal point for new year-themed self-guided scavenger hunts and keeper chats each weekend in February. On Saturday and Sunday February 17 and 18, Chinese Theatre Works will perform puppet shows and hold a calligraphy workshop for zoo guests of all ages. All activities are free with the paid admission. The full schedule of events and activities can be seen at the zoos’ respective websites: www.propectparkzoo.com and www.queenszoo.com.
