						Bronx, NY – Nov 23, 2021 – A Coquerel’s sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) born at the Bronx Zoo has made its public debut. 

The birth is the result of the hard work and husbandry expertise of the Bronx Zoo’s keepers and will be featured on this week’s episode of Animal Planet’s THE ZOO. The story follows the adult sifakas as they introduced for the first time in hopes that they will eventually mate. 

The baby is a male and was born over the summer. The Bronx Zoo breeds sifakas as part of the Species Survival Plan (SSP) program, a cooperative breeding program administered by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to maintain genetic diversity and demographic stability in zoo populations. 

Six species of lemurs, including Coquerel’s sifakas, can be seen in the zoo’s Madagascar! exhibit. Exhibit times for the baby may vary as it continues to acclimate and bond with its mother. 

Like all lemur species, Coquerel’s sifakas are found only on the island nation of Madagascar. The species is classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Numbers in the wild are decreasing due to deforestation and other human activities. 

THE ZOO, now in its fifth season, airs on Animal Planet on Saturdays 9pm ET/PT and is the first series to go behind the scenes at the world-famous Bronx Zoo. The powerful stories focus on the animals, their keepers, and the zoo’s contribution to conserving wildlife around the globe.
