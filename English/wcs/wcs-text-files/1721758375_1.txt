Volunteer docents and guides enhance zoo-going experience


		
 

Brooklyn, NY – August 10, 2010 – The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Prospect Park Zoo announced today that it is welcoming new applications for its Discovery Guide and Docent Programs, which educate the public about the zoo’s animals and WCS’s conservation mission. 

 

A basic volunteer training program, offered fall and winter, qualifies adults and teens to be Discovery Guides at the zoo. Once trained, guides will be able to answer questions about the zoo’s animals, present “biofacts” at Discovery Stations, assist in the interactive Discovery Center, work at special events, and teach visitors how to interact with alpacas, horses, and sheep in the barn area. 

 

Teen Discovery Guides are able to assist on group tours, staff birthday parties and educational programs, and enhance their public speaking skills.

 

Adults who enroll in the program will have the opportunity to advance to the docent level by completing the Interpretation and Animal Handling courses offered in the winter.  Docents help visitors by interpreting exhibits, leading group tours, and presenting Live Animal Encounters to the public that include teaching children and families about wildlife from the zoo’s collection of education animals.

 

WCS’s Prospect Park Zoo volunteers will have the opportunity to meet visitors from around the world, work with others who enjoy sharing their knowledge, and aid the Wildlife Conservation Society in their mission to save wildlife and wild places. 

 

The application deadline for the fall class is Thursday, September 9, 2010; the deadline for the winter courses is Thursday, January 6, 2011.
