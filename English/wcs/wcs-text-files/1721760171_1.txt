First camel born at Bronx Zoo since 1982 now on exhibit at Wild Asia												
												Bronx, NY – June 22, 2012 – A male dromedary camel calf at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo stays close to its mother in Wild Asia.
 
 This calf is the first camel born at the Bronx Zoo since 1982. It weighed approximately 80 pounds at birth on March 16, and could grow to be over 1,500 pounds as an adult. 
 
 Dromedary camels are native to Northern Africa and Arabic regions of Asia. They have one hump which easily distinguishes them from their two-humped cousin, the bactrian camel. 
 
 The Bronx Zoo has 12 dromedary camels and one bactrian camel. Although most camels are tan or brown, they can range from white to black. The new calf is the only white camel in the zoo’s herd. Visitors to WCS’s Bronx Zoo can ride one of the adult camels at Asia Plaza.
 
 The calf is now on exhibit at Wild Asia.
