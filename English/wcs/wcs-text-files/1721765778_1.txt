						COVID-19 is spreading globally through human-to-human transmission.The Veterinary Services of Hong Kong reported on two dogs that showed presence of the COVID-19 virus after sharing a common living space and contact with their owners who were positive for COVID-19.  However, there is no evidence that companion animals, such as dogs and cats can spread COVID-19 to people or other animals. There is also no evidence that they become sick from this virus.Irrespective of COVID-19, when caring for pets always maintain good hygiene.Helpful Sources on COVID-19 and Companion Animals:NY State Veterinary Medical SocietyWorld Organization for Animal HealthWorld Health OrganizationCDCFor all WCS Updates on COVID-19 go HERE.
