Bronx, NY – May 3, 2011 – A young Grevy’s zebra recently made its public debut in the African Plains exhibit at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo.

Born in early 2011, this young female is the first zebra born at the Bronx Zoo since 2003. She spends her time running around her exhibit but never strays too far from her mother and father. Zebras stripes are brown at birth and gradually turn black as the animal matures.

 

Grevy’s zebras are critically endangered in the wild and can be found in Northern Kenya. The Wildlife Conservation Society works to save wildlife and wild places around the world including the zebra’s African range.
