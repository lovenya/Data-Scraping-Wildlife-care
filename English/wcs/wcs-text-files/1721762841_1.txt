						The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Adirondack Program today announced a call for volunteers to help census loons on Adirondack lakes as part of the 15th Annual Adirondack Loon Census taking place from 8:00–9:00 a.m. on Saturday, July 18.   With the help of local Adirondack residents and visitor volunteers, the census enables WCS to collect important data on the status of the breeding loon population in and around the Adirondack Park and across New York State. The results help guide management decisions and policies affecting loons.  Volunteers report on the number of adult and immature loons and loon chicks that they observe during the hour-long census. Similar loon censuses will be conducted in other states throughout the Northeast simultaneously to inform a regional overview of the population’s current status.   Anyone interested in volunteering can get more information about how to sign up by visiting www.wcsadirondacks.org , by calling 518-891-8874, ext. 106, or by emailing accp@wcs.org.     “We gain an important regional picture of the loon population each year through the Annual Loon Census,” said Zoë Smith, Director of WCS’s Adirondack Program.  “We are indebted to the hundreds of volunteers who participate as citizen scientists in this important research.  Only through their participation and dedication are we able to assemble so much valuable information to help guide future management decisions.”   This year, WCS will be including an additional set of questions to gather information on the types and amount of on-water recreation occurring during the census period.  The Annual Loon Census is a project of the WCS Adirondack Program and is conducted in partnership with the BioDiversity Research Institute.
