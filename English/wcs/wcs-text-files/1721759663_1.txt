				New York, N.Y. –November 2, 2011– The holidays are right around the corner and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo is celebrating the season with Winterfest – a holiday celebration that includes special performances, holiday lighting displays, and presents for the animals. 

 

During the first three Fridays and Saturdays in December (Dec. 2-3, 9-10, 16-17) the zoo will stay open until 6:30 p.m. inviting visitors to stroll through the zoo and enjoy thousands of white lights, theater performances, and presents to the animals. 

 

Lights and festive greenery line the pathways to winter-themed activities. At Winterfest, the polar bear and penguins will receive presents filled with their favorite treats including fish-sickles and fruits.  Animal keepers and zoo guides will be available to talk to guests about the animals and answer questions.

 

Polar-themed performances by WCS’s Wildlife Theater and live animal encounters in the Zoo Gallery will headline this year’s Winterfest activities. Families can also make a special winter craft to take home.

 

The Central Park Zoo’s 4-D Theater will be showing The Polar Express™ 4-D Experience is based on the film from Warner Bros. Pictures and Shangri-La Entertainment and Planet Earth: Ice Worlds 4D Experience from BBC Earth.

 

For a break from the chilly air, the Central Park Zoo’s Tropic Zone is a steamy 80 degrees all year long. Home to tropical birds, lemurs, and more, it is the perfect place to take a break from the cold.
