Hatching of bird species is a significant husbandry success												
												Fewer than 40 crested couas live in U.S. zoos   Bronx, NY – Oct. 22, 2012 – ATTACHED PHOTO: A rare crested coua chick is hand-reared in an off-exhibit area at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Central Park Zoo. The chick displays the markings on the inside of its mouth as it prepares to receive food from its caretaker. These markings are unique for each individual chick and fade as the bird matures.    The markings on the inside of a coua chick’s beak are believed to be used by the parents for identification or as a target to aid in feeding.    Crested couas are a species of cuckoo native to the African island nation of Madagascar. Although widespread in their native range, they are rare in U.S. zoos, with fewer than 40 living in American zoos. The hatching is a significant achievement as WCS’s Central Park Zoo is only the fourth zoo in the U.S. to have successfully reared a coua chick.    The Wildlife Conservation Society has field conservation programs within the crested coua’s range in Madagascar – and in nearly 60 countries and all four of the world’s oceans.
