						The Cambridge Conservation Initiative (CCI) formally accepted the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) as its 11thpartner – the first new partner to join since the ground-breaking, multidisciplinary initiative was established 15 years ago.

Mel Heath, Chair of CCI formally welcomed WCS at a signing event at the Cambridge Museum of Zoology.

Joe Walston, Executive Vice President for WCS Global, who signed the partnership agreement, said: “CCI has proven itself to be an effective crucible for the melding of the talents of ten leading conservation organisations, out of which have come a unique set of collaborative initiatives at the cutting edge of global conservation efforts. We are proud to join the CCI in its ambitious efforts over the coming years, as it will take partnerships like this to unite the local and global efforts to reverse the decline in nature.”

The Wildlife Conservation Society has a long track record of delivering innovative, impactful conservation results at scale across the world’s oceans and in nearly 60 countries. Aligned with CCI’s values and mission, WCS is a science-based organisation with a mission to save wildlife and wild places. With this partnership, WCS will now open an office within the CCI conservation campus in the David Attenborough Building in Cambridge. Opened in 2015 by Sir David himself, the conservation campus is one of the great successes born out of the CCI partnership, seeing an old University building transformed into a vibrant hub for collaborative conservation.

Dr Mike Maunder, CCI Executive Director said, ‘We are thrilled to have the Wildlife Conservation Society join CCI at this pivotal time for nature. The WCS team brings a wealth of complementary expertise perfectly aligned to help deliver our ambitious ten-year strategy to protect and restore the natural world. From initial discussions, it is very clear that WCS will be an active partner that shares our sense of urgency.”

The CCI collaboration has formed a globally unique hub for conservation innovation that spans research, policy, data management and analysis, social sciences, and field delivery. The close relationship with the University of Cambridge Conservation Research Institute was a key factor in WCS joining CCI.
