By most accounts, tigers face an uncertain future. A century ago, an estimated 100,000 of these regal felines used to roam the planet, but countless threats have driven their numbers down to an estimated 3,200 wild individuals. In the midst of a global poaching and wildlife trade crisis, WCS reports significant progress in three separate landscapes.

Dr. Cristián Samper, WCS President and CEO, explains: “Victories like these give us the resolve to continue to battle for these magnificent big cats.
