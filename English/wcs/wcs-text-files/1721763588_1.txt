The marmoset trio was born in March to parents Gordon, a 4-year-old male, and Xing, a 5-year-old female. Triplet births are unusual in marmosets. Geoffroy’s marmosets, also known as white-fronted marmosets, are native to small fragments of Atlantic rainforest in eastern Brazil. While the species is not classified as endangered, they live in areas that are susceptible to deforestation which threatens their habitats. WCS works within this species’ range and in many South American countries to reconcile human development needs with conservation. The breeding of Geoffroy’s marmosets is part of the Species Survival Plan (SSP), a cooperative breeding program designed to enhance the genetic viability and demographic stability of animal populations in zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). A Geoffroy’s tamarin was born at Prospect Park Zoo in April and is the fifth baby successfully reared by parents Napoleon and Canoli. Geoffroy’s tamarins are native to central and eastern Panama and Columbia and are sensitive to deforestation and habitat loss. WCS works within this species’ range to protect local wildlife and habitat.    For more information or to speak with a WCS expert, contact Barbara Russo at 917-494-5493, 718-265-3428, or brusso@wcs.org.
