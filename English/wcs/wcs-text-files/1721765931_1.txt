						New York – July 18, 2020 – Based on new Phase 4 guidelines from the NY State Governor’s Office on Friday, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is moving forward with plans to reopen its four zoos but will postpone the reopening of the NY Aquarium until further guidance from the state. All outdoor exhibits and grounds at its four zoos (Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo) will be open while indoor exhibits will not open at this time. Governor Cuomo announced Friday that NY City would move into Phase 4 but this phase for this region will now not include indoor activity in malls, restaurants, or cultural institutions. As announced previously, all four zoos will be open Monday through Thursday this coming week, July 20-23 for WCS members only; and open to all guests beginning on Friday, July 24. All other details, including new safety protocols, from WCS’s earlier announcement on its parks reopening will remain the same. You can find the July 9 news announcement HERE. WCS is committed to following all guidelines from the state and city and ensuring that guests have a safe and enjoyable experience in its parks. All its zoos offer extensive outdoor exhibits and grounds that allow guests to have experiences with nature and wildlife.
