Update: As of June 1, 2012, 12.6 million Save Vanishing Species stamps have been sold, raising $1.35 million for conservation. 						
				It’s official: Thanks to your emails, calls, and letters advocating for a new U.S. Postal Service stamp to support wildlife conservation, the Save Vanishing Species stamp is now on sale at post offices across the country and online. The First Class stamp, which features a tiger cub illustration, costs 55 cents. Net proceeds—a total of 10 cents from the sale of each stamp—will go to tiger, rhino, great ape, marine turtle, and elephant conservation projects, including several led by WCS. These projects are supported by the Multinational Species Conservation Funds, which is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (Read more about the stamp’s background here.)
“The Save Vanishing Species tiger stamp represents a unique opportunity for all Americans to help conserve the world’s most iconic species,” said John Calvelli, WCS’s Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. “Buying this stamp is a small but meaningful investment in our worldwide conservation efforts and I encourage all of our zoo and aquarium visitors to take that important step.”
Today, only 3,200 tigers populate 42 source sites across 13 countries in Asia that are now the last hope and greatest priority for the conservation and recovery of the world’s largest cat. Source sites contain the majority of the world’s remaining breeding females—approximately 1,000 individuals—and have the potential to seed the recovery of tigers across wider landscapes. Multinational Species Conservation Funds, soon to be supplemented by proceeds from the stamp, provide critical support to programs that protect these last remaining tiger habitats.
