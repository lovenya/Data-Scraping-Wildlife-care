						Bronx, NY – Dec. 19, 2022 – On Saturday, Dec. 17, Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson and officials from the Bronx Zoo were joined by Santa and Mrs. Claus at the zoo to distribute toys to local Bronx military families in need this holiday season.

Spanning two BP administrations and now in its 14th year, this event has become a tradition in the Bronx.  The partnership between the Bronx Zoo and the BP Gibson is continuing to serve members of the community who have served their country but find it difficult to make ends meet during the holidays.

As a holiday treat for those in attendance at the Borough President’s toy giveaway event, Santa and Mrs. Claus was also on hand for photo opportunities and to help give away the toys.
