In "The Secret Language of Elephants," 60 Minutes’ reporter Bob Simon visits WCS conservationist Andrea Turkalo in the Central African Republic, where she studies elephants in the second largest rainforest on Earth. The world’s leading expert on forest elephants, Turkalo has been working in this wildlife haven for 19 years. 

Turkalo discusses the dictionary of elephant sounds that she is compiling by observing their behavior and recording their calls. She also explains how monitoring the elephants in their forest home allows her to keep track of the poachers who threaten their existence.

Watch "The Secret Language of Elephants" and meet the WCS conservationist who Simon calls the elephants' “guardian angel.”
