At WCS, we are committed to improving the conservation and management of lions in protected and game reserve areas and across the broader landscape. Better information on population numbers and their distribution are needed in many areas to improve management.  “We believe that listing the lion under the U.S. Endangered Species Act will encourage this better management of lion populations.  WCS recognizes that hunting programs provide an important source of revenue for conservation in some countries in Africa and supports the proposal by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the import of specimens but only if legally obtained and as part of a well-regulated, scientifically-sound management program.   “Lions face multiple threats: habitat loss, loss of their prey, poorly-regulated recreational hunting, and their killing after conflicts with local communities and their livestock. It is estimated there are only 25,000 to 30,000 remaining in the wild. Better science and better management on the ground can mean a recovery for the great, majestic lion.” ### WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) MISSION: WCS saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature.
