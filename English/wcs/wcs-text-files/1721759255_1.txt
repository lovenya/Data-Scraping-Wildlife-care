FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
  
 Comments from Jim Breheny, Director of the Bronx Zoo:
  
 “We thank our Bronx neighbors and the New York Police Department for helping us retrieve our peahen this morning. We recovered her in the garage of a local business where she was safely corralled. She has been examined by our veterinarians at our Wildlife Health Center where she is resting comfortably. Preliminary indications are that she is in good condition. We will keep our tradition of free-roaming peafowl at the Bronx Zoo. We are confident that after this peahen's recent adventure, she won't want to wander from her home at the zoo.”
