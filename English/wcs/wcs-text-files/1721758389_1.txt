Brooklyn
		, New York – Aug. 16, 2010 – Tazo, an orphaned northern sea otter pup found stranded this summer in Homer, Alaska, has found a new home at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s New York Aquarium. The two-month old pup will be bottle-fed a special sea otter formula and receive round-the-clock care until he can be weaned and moved into the aquarium’s sea otter exhibit later this year. Without his mother, Tazo would not have survived in the wild.
