They work within the facilities’ education department to interpret exhibits, interact with visitors, and assist with public events and activities.    Discovery Guides will be trained in public speaking and teaching methods to educate zoo and aquarium visitors about the biology and behavior of the wildlife on exhibit. While serving their community, teens in the program will also gain experience in filling out job applications and interviewing, developing a strong work ethic, public presentation skills, time management, working in teams, and leadership skills, all of which are vital to academic and professional success.  Students can also receive community service credit for their work. Applications for the Discovery Guide program will be accepted until Thursday, April 30. Candidates must be available for all training sessions taking place in June and July. More information can be found on each facilities web site.   Volunteer shifts are available every day of the week. Those interested in applying should visit www.wcs.org/volunteer.     National Volunteer Week was started in 1974 by Points of Light, an organization that encourages people to take action on the causes they care about.     The Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays, 5:30 p.m. weekends from April to October; 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m November to March.
