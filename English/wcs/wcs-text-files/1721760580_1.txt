Nov. 2, 2012CONTACT: MARY DIXON, mdixon@wcs.org, 347-840-1242 (texts and emails are best) From Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President of Zoos and Aquarium, Director of the Bronx Zoo:We have restored power to three-quarters of the exhbits and holding quarters at the aquarium. Work progresses in restoring power to the last large exhibit building at WCSâ€™s New York Aquarium, Explore the Shore. Progress to restore this power is slower than we anticipated due to the adverse conditions and extensive damage to electrical and mechanical equipment caused by contact with salt water. We remain optimistic that we can restore power to the life support systems of this exhibit in the next several hours.  Many of you have asked about the status of the collection. Our walruses, sea lions, seals, sea otters, sea turtles and sharks are all fine.  We did have some losses in the fish collection, most of which were confined to one exhibit tank that we could not access immediately after the storm hit.  The rest of our exhibit and holding tanks and the fish that are housed there are all doing well.  As the health and well-being of our collection is our most important concern, we will ask area aquariums who volunteered to help with any necessary fish relocation to stand by throughout the weekend in the event we are unsuccessful in our efforts to restore power to this one remaining area.  Our marine mammals will remain at the aquarium as we assess the full impact of the damages inflicted by Hurricane Sandy. The results of this study will provide the blueprint as we proceed and what if any species have to be temporarily relocated as we move forward with the restoration and re-opening of the New York Aquarium on Coney Island.  We have had many people ask how they can help. Supporters can go to nyaquarium.com to help us restore our facilities.
