A new study on wolverine behavior shines light on why these weasels depend upon icy mountaintops: food refrigeration. 
 
 When it’s plentiful, wolverines harvest and store meat, burying it into snow packs and cold mountain crevices- the human equivalent of stocking the freezer. By refrigerating their food, these foragers guard against bacteria and would-be scavengers. They also guarantee a supply of nutrition through lean times and when females need it most: during cub-rearing.
