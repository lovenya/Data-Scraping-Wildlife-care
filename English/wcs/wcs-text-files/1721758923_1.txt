				Owls and other nocturnal animals welcome Winter Solstice
				

		
		

		
New York, Dec. 20, 2010 – Winter Solstice is the official start of winter and the shortest day of the year, but for the snowy owl at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo the conditions don’t get any better. 

 

Hedwig, the Bronx Zoo’s snowy owl, resides at the zoo’s Birds of Prey exhibit. Snowy owls are typically found in the Arctic. They enjoy the cold weather and are most active at night.  

 

The Wildlife Conservation Society works around the globe and across the snowy owl’s range to save wildlife and wild places. Climate change is just one of many factors that could prove detrimental to the snowy owl as the change in global temperatures adversely affects food sources and habitat.
