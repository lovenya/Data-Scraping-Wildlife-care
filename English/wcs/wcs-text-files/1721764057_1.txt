Canada lynx are medium-sized cats that have thick grayish-brown coats and pointed tufts on their ears.  Their oversized paws are covered in dense fur and act as snowshoes to prevent them from sinking in deep snow in their native habitats. Their range spans Alaska, Canada, and portions of the northern and western United States. Canada lynx populations are healthy in some portions of their historic range. They are classified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species of Least Concern. In the United States, they are protected under the Endangered Species Act as a threatened species.  Their numbers have declined due to trapping for their coats and timber harvesting which has altered habitat and significantly reduced the population of the snowshoe hare, the primary prey.  WCS works around the world and within the lynx’s North American range to save wildlife and their habitats.
