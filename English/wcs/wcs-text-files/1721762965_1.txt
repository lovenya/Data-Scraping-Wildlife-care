						The Aceh Tenggara District Police (Polres Aceh Tenggara), the Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP) rangers, and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS’s) Wildlife Crimes Unit (WCU) announced today the arrest of a wildlife poacher and a trader for trading body parts of a Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae).   The arrest occurred in Kutacane, Aceh on September 9, 2015, and was led by Second Police Inspector (Ipda) Bustani, four policemen and two GLNP forest rangers. The operation involved a transaction for one fresh tiger skin, two kilograms of tiger bones, including one tiger skull, and four tiger fangs. The two perpetrators allegedly poached and traded tiger parts in Aceh in 2015.  According to their confessions, the suspects recently sold a fresh tiger skin and bones from a tiger snared in mid-August in Gayo Lues forest.  Additionally, skins and bones from eight tigers have been sold by the two since 2011.  The poachers confessed to also having bought tiger skins and other body parts from local villagers. Based on the initial interrogation conducted by the police, the two perpetrators are connected to four poachers and traders that were arrested by Aceh Police on August 6, 2015. The Sumatran tiger is a Critically Endangered tiger sub-species and can only be found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

We will work with GLNP and civil society to combat tiger poaching in the Leuser Landscape.” Andi Basrul, the Head of Gunung Leuser National Park said, “This arrest shows our commitment in protecting Gunung Leuser National Park’s ecosystem which had been mandated to us to be managed.
