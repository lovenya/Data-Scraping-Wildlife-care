						  The World Economic Forum has selected Dr. Krithi K. Karanth, an Associate Conservation Scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, as a 2015 Young Global Leader (YGL). The prestigious honour was announced today and recognizes Dr. Karanth as one of 187 distinguished leaders below the age of 40 from around the world.   The Forum of Young Global Leaders is a community made up of the world’s most outstanding next-generation leaders who commit both their time and talent to make the world a better place. Upon nomination, YGLs already have a proven record of extraordinary personal achievement, and the Forum helps YGLs build collaborations, learn and take actions to positively impact global challenges through innovative solutions. Former YGLs include prominent personalities like Vishwanathan Anand, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Anderson Cooper, among many others. WCS’s Executive Vice President for Conservation and Science Dr. John Robinson said, “We are grateful to the World Economic Forum for recognizing the achievements of Krithi Karanth, and her efforts to understand how to effect conservation in a human-dominated world.  Her work provides insights in how to protect nature while addressing human needs and aspirations.” "Being selected as part of the YGL program is an incredible honour and provides me with a unique opportunity to engage with a broader network of entrepreneurs, business leaders, politicians and change-makers in society. I hope to develop a stronger constituency for wildlife conservation in India and globally," says Dr. Karanth. In addition to Dr. Karanth, this year’s list of honourees includes 12 Indians: Aditya Ghosh, Ameera Shah, Ashish Goyal, Gaurav Gogoi, Kiran Kumar Grandhi, Neha Kirpal, Prashant Sarin, Shalini Puchalapalli, Shweta Punj, Smrithi Zubin Irani and Vijaya Gadde.  Indian wildlife faces daunting challenges as do conservation scientists in balancing the needs of people and wildlife. These challenges will only continue to intensify if appropriate and innovative interventions are not implemented.  Dr. Karanth has been working for almost two decades to understand and effectively address these challenges.  Working with research and conservation colleagues from the WCS India Program, Dr. Karanth has implemented over 25 projects and involved over 500 citizen science volunteers. She holds a Master’s degree from Yale University, and a Doctorate from Duke University. She has carried out extensive research on Indian wildlife, particularly human dimensions of wildlife conservation, publishing over 60 scientific and popular articles.   YGL is the latest of numerous honours that Krithi has been bestowed with for her contributions to society. She was declared National Geographic Society's 10,000th grantee in 2011 and selected as an Emerging Explorer in 2012. She was selected among India’s Power Women by Femina (2012), Women of the Year by Elle India (2013) and INK Fellow (2013).   Dr. Karanth has not only helped advance wildlife research and innovations in conservation, but has also shaped numerous conservationists to take the cause ahead. She holds an Adjunct Assistant Professorship at the Duke University (USA) and is a Teaching Faculty at the premier National Centre for Biological Sciences, India.   In a letter congratulating her on her nomination, Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman and Founder of The Forum of YGL said, “Your nomination is in recognition of your record of professional accomplishments, your commitment to society and your potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world through your inspiring leadership.”  The World Economic Forum is an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.
