Statement from The Bronx Zoo “This afternoon the Bronx Zoo was contacted by the Animal Care Centers of NYC, regarding a young male wallaby that it had received earlier today from a private individual who could not provide proper care for it. Wallabies are mid-sized marsupials native to Australia and New Guinea.  “The wallaby was taken to the Bronx Zoo’s Wildlife Health Center where it will undergo a routine 30-day quarantine so that the zoo’s veterinarians can assess its overall health.  “The Bronx Zoo considered this situation to be an animal welfare issue and agreed to take the wallaby because it has the resources and expertise to provide for the animal’s needs. The situation with this animal is a classic example of why exotic animals do not make good pets.”
