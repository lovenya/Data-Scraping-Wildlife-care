Coney Island, Brooklyn, May 25, 2013 -- The Wildlife Conservation Society welcomed a large crowd this morning at the WCS New York Aquarium as it opened for the first time since Hurricane Sandy.

The line began to build 30 minutes before the 10 a.m. opening, and visitors continued to stream in throughout the day.

The aquarium is an anchor in the Coney Island community, pumping more than $58 million into the local economy annually and serving as an education center for more than 120,000 school children each year.

"The beaches were cold but the warm welcome at the WCS New York Aquarium brought in the crowds," said Jon Forrest Dohlin, WCS Vice President and Director of the WCS New York Aquarium. "We are excited to be back open for Coney Island, Brooklyn and conservation."

Wildlife Conservation Society's New York Aquarium is open every day of the year. Summer hours are May 25 - Sept. 2, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is $9.95 per person; children under 3 years of age are admitted free. Fridays after 4 p.m. in the summer and after 3 p.m. in the fall, admission is by pay-what-you-wish donation.
