The team members left Mysore on Wednesday, and will be reaching Gujarat. Vice-chairman of the Wildlife Board and former skipper of Indian cricket team, Anil Kumble who was supposed to join the team cancelled his visit at the eleventh hour, following ongoing Ranji matches being played in Mysore.

Sources told Deccan Herald that the authorities of Gir Sanctuary have come forward to spare the lions against the gaur and some exotic birds. 

The lions, which are presently housed in the Mysore zoo, are hybrid. What they are planning to get from the Gir sanctuary are pure breed. The purpose of getting them here is for breeding. 

This deal is almost through thanks to the initiative of Anil Kumble, who held talks with the Chief Minister of Gujarat as well as with the senior officials of that Government.

Decks cleared

The sources said the team members would be selecting the pair on Thursday and then make necessary arrangements. Almost all the decks are cleared for the deal and the lions may arrive in Mysore within one month. 

It would be proud for the Mysore Zoo to display the pure breed of the Asiatic Lions.

Cheetah

Two pairs of hunting Cheetahs are expected to arrive within a couple of weeks. At present, a zoo near the Gir Sanctuary, has the hunting Cheetah. Mysore Zoo would become the second zoo in the country to have them. 

The team would also visit that zoo to see the pattern of enclosure being made for the Cheetah. A similar arrangement would be made here too, the sources noted. In the world, Mysore Zoo enjoys a high reputation both in India and abroad. The zoo has procured several species of animals and birds on the exchange programme. 

Besides, Mysore Zoo has carved a niche for itself in breeding of exotic animals and birds.
