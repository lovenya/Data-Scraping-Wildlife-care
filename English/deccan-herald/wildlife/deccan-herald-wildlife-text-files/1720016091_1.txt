Jayakumar is the 4th Indian to have been honoured with both the awards. The other three are M Y Ghorpade, P N A Perumal and B Srinivasa. 

Incidentally, the twin distinction of FRPS and MFIAP for Nature Photography to an individual has come after 21 years. It was last received by B Srinivas in 1989.

Both these awards are given for nature photography. Jayakumar has been a wildlife photographer for the last two decades and has won several national and international awards.
