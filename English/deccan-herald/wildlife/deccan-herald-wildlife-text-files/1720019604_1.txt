The work was handed over to Chennai based B B Hills Wind Farm Development. When this move of the government was known, the environmentalists and wildlife activists in 2005 started a movement demanding withdrawal of the order keeping in the mind the sensitive features of the region.

Manish Kumar and others moved to the court against the project. Petitions were filed at the Civil Court seeking stay order against the same. 

The Corporation challenged the stay order at the High Court, which in turn directed the Corporation to settle the matter at the lower court.

Meanwhile a High Level Committee of the Supreme Court said that since the land in question is a ‘Shola Forest’, it should not be used for any other activity. Using the land for any industrial or development purpose will be the violation of Forest Act, the Committee said recommending cancellation of the lease.

Citing the Committee’s recommendation, Deputy Conservator of Forest had written to the Deputy Commissioner to cancel the lease and take the land under government control. 
It is learnt that though the DC had written to the Corporation, there has been no reply from the authorities, which compelled the DC to withdraw the order and take the land under Government control. 

Meanwhile D V Girish from Bhadra Vanya Jeevi Samrakshana Samsthe, Sridev Hulikere from Wild Cat-C, G Veeresh from Nature Conservation Guild and other wildlife activitists have welcomed the move.ADVERTISEMENT
