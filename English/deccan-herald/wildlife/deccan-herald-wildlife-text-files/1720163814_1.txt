City-based wildlife photographer H S Byakod has bagged the prestigious Oklahoma International Exhibition of Photography award for his breathtaking photograph of a bird preying on a bee.

ADVERTISEMENTSharing his joy with Deccan Herald, the 35-year-old photographer, who has been in the field for more than 15 years, said, “ I was not expecting to win as many senior photographers, including those from National Geographic, took part in the exhibition. I shot the award-winning photo in Mysuru about a year ago with a Nikon D300 camera.”

As many as 3,194 contestants  from about 50 countries across the world participated in the exhibition conducted by the Oklahoma Camera Club. Byakod had sent four entries for the competition in February and was declared the winner in May, this year. The picture that won the attention of the judges is the 'Bee eater with Feed’.  There were a total of 960 entries in the wildlife section. 

 The same photograph also won an award at the World Photographic Championship organised by the Newton Abbot Photographic Club last year. 

The three other remaining entries which he sent to Oklahoma Club  were 'Rat Snake', ' Flamingos' and ‘Small Blue Kingfisher with Feed'. 

“I remember using a camera soon after completing my SSLC. My father was a nature lover and even I was intrigued by nature and its surroundings. I plan to hold nature awareness programmes and photography workshops in the coming days,” he added. 

Byakod’s pictures have been displayed at exhibitions in America, China, Australia, Russia (Siberia), Sri Lanka among other countries. He has more than 50 international awards in his kitty.
