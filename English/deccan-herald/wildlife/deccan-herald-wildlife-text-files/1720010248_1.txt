Typically about 10 percent of the flock dies off.ADVERTISEMENTStehn says including new births, this year's flock is expected to drop by about 20 birds from last year's 270 when counted in the fall.The whooping crane numbered just 15 in 1941 but now numbers 539 and is considered a success story by conservationists.
