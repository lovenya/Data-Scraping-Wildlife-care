The emblematic birds may be forced to travel further afield to find food."It is a very active area for algae growth, especially in springtime," explained Dr Neal Young from the Australia-based Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Co-operative Research Centre.

"There are emperor penguin colonies about 200-300 km away to the west. They come to this area to feed and seals in the area also come to get access to the open water," he told BBC News.

He suggested that a change in the availability of open water could affect the rate of food production, which would have an impact on the amount of wildlife it could sustain.
"If the area gets choked up (with ice), then they would have to go elsewhere and look for food."

The calving of the iceberg, which has an estimated mass of 700-800 bn tonnes, has changed the shape of the local geography, Dr Young explained.

"We have got two massive icebergs that - end to end - create a fence of about 180 km. So the area's geography has changed from a situation where we effectively had a box in which two sides were open ocean," he said.ADVERTISEMENT
