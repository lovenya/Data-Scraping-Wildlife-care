The government on Friday honoured 50 forest personnel for their exceptional services in conservation, from recognising pit vipers to preventing man-animal conflict as well as two personnel who played a role in operations against Veerappan.ADVERTISEMENTChief Minister Siddaramaiah, who honoured the personnel, praised their contribution and stressed the need to protect forests and wildlife. "The forest area must be expanded to 33% from the current 20% of the total land area to reduce climate extremes. We are facing many problems due to scarcity of rain, which has damaged 50% of crops in 40 lakh hectares of land," he said.Forest guard M Santosh Kumar and driver M Ramachandra, two personnel who played a major role in the Veerappan case, were belatedly recognised for their role. "The awards were set up in 2017. Those in the police service have been honoured, but forest personnel were not recognised. It's a small gesture to ensure their service is not forgotten," sources in the department said.The department made a special mention of M Ramachandra's work with the police. "During the crackdown on Veerappan's associate, Ramachandra escaped from the forest brigand several times," a note on Ramachandra read.The other personnel included forest watcher Mohan Kumar K G, who rescued more than 20 leopards in conflict situations, Deputy Range Forest officer G Balakrishna for his role in mitigating the man-elephant conflict on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, Range Forest Officer (RFO) Sunita T who thwarted illegal mining, RFO Srinivas Naik who conducted research on macaques and RFO Amrut Desai for his role in developing and implementation of timber auction software.
