But at Dockside Green, a 15-acre mixed-use development being built just north of Victoria’s (British Columbia) downtown harbour, neighbourhood utilities are less a cause for alarm than part of the amenity package. 

“These are our best-selling units,” said Joe Van Belleghem, a local developer who won a city-sponsored competition in 2004 to develop Dockside Green. Recently, Van Belleghem was on site, pointing to ground-floor condominiums with decks jutting over a network of ponds and waterways containing native plants, otters and ducks. The artificial creek circulates wastewater from an adjacent underground sewage treatment plant. That water is also used to flush toilets and irrigate the landscape, a closed system that helps reduce water bills for residents, provides a refuge for wildlife and “improves the marketability of the space,” Van Belleghem said.  “So it’s all integrated: the economic, the environmental, the social,” he added. 

Holistic design
The holistic design is the hallmark of Dockside Green, which will eventually encompass 1.3 million square feet, including 26 buildings and 2,500 residents. The project’s first neighbourhood, Dockside Wharf, was completed last year and has 266 market-rate apartments, 253 of which have sold; 26 “affordable” units; 32,600 square feet of office space; and 5,881 square feet of retail. 

The development also includes an $8 million Canadian heating plant that converts locally sourced wood waste into a clean-burning gas that produces all the community’s heat and hot water. The system, which eliminates the need to use fossil fuels as a heat source, illustrates Dockside’s neighbourhood-based approach to environmentally friendly design, said Robert Drew, a project architect and an associate principal with Busby Perkins & Will.  Dockside also reflects Victoria’s interest in maintaining the industrial character of the city as it redevelops waterfront land, said Deborah Day, the city’s director of planning.
“There is an effort to incorporate residential mixed use in balance with preserving a working harbour, which is very much a part of Victoria’s tradition and economic engine,” she said.

At the southern end of Vancouver Island overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Victoria, population 330,000, is the capital of British Columbia. A former logging and shipbuilding outpost, the city is known for its large population of retirees and for tourist attractions like the Fairmont Empress Hotel and the Royal BC Museum.ADVERTISEMENTLast year, the Clinton Climate Initiative selected Dockside Green as one of the founding ‘Climate Positive Developments’ around the world. The programme showcases urban developments that aim for negative carbon emissions. The Canadian Home Builders’ Association also awarded Dockside Green a top honour last year as one of the most innovative projects in Canada. 

Among the signs of Dockside’s environmental sensibility are rooftop wind turbines and awnings that double as solar panels. There are also windows that showcase the hustle and bustle outside: kayaks in the harbour, the Point Hope Shipyard and mountains of rock courtesy of the local asphalt plant.

In addition to the project’s green features, the commission’s staff welcomes Dockside’s proximity to downtown and amenities like the more than 30-mile Galloping Goose cycling and pedestrian trail that runs by the development, said Alex Ferguson, the commission’s chief executive. He noted that the provincial government required any building it leased to meet LEED gold standards, and that reducing fossil fuel usage would also save money.

Reducing energy use
A passive solar design, fresh air ventilation and efficient appliances help reduce energy use in Dockside Green buildings about 50 percent compared with conventional buildings, Drew said. Units have sensors that allow residents to monitor daily energy and water use.

Because wood waste is considered a zero emission fuel, Dockside Green residents are not charged a carbon tax for heat and hot water.  

The provincial tax, among the first of its kind in North America, is about 20 Canadian dollars per ton of carbon dioxide emissions and is set to rise to $30 per ton by 2012. (The tax typically shows up at the gasoline pump and in utility bills.) In June, Dockside Green Energy, the utility that operates the thermal plant, began selling excess heating capacity to a nearby hotel, the Delta Victoria Ocean Pointe Resort Hotel and Spa. The deal allows the hotel to idle its natural gas-powered boilers, and Drew said that was the reason Dockside was considered a carbon positive project. 

Several other large projects are in progress in downtown Victoria, including the Atrium, a 200,000-square-foot office building; a homeless shelter; and the Hudson, a mixed-use renovation of a former department store. 

Over the last 20 years, about 2,000 housing units have also been built on onetime industrial lands, Day said. Of those revitalisation initiatives, Dockside Green comes closest to recreating, in 21st-century form, the city’s century-old land-use pattern, she said. * Dockside Green, a 15-acre mixed-use development being built just north of Victoria’s (British Columbia) downtown harbour.
