Even though a complaint has been submitted against a former deputy conservator of forests and other officials for submitting some tampered documents to the high court, no action has been initiated, Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust managing trustee D V Girish said.ADVERTISEMENTThe then Assistant Conservator of Forests G Venkatesh had filed a complaint against the illegal activities, such as encroachment of forest area, construction of road and building at Bhadra Tiger reserve, by a wildlife watcher.Based on a newspaper report, the high court had registered a suo motu complaint and had ordered the forest department to submit a report.Accordingly, a report was prepared by ACF Shashidhar and team. But the report lacked proper details of the road construction and the encroached area.The then assistant conservator of forests of the forest department mobile squad had mentioned an objection by writing a remark in the report and signing his name. But, when the record was submitted to the high court, the page containing the remarks by Venkatesh was removed. The document was later signed by the Director of Tiger Reserve Venkateshan. The court was informed that the encroachment has been cleared, he said.In a press release, Girish has urged to initiate stern action against the wrongdoers.Even though a complaint has been submitted to the regional forest division, no action has been initiated yet, he said.
