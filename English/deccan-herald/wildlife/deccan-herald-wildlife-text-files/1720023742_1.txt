The Chambal-dominated Hadoti region of Rajasthan wears a very green look during the monsoons. The place has varied wildlife ranging from small insects to huge animals and is a wild treat during the monsoons. The gurgling music at innumerable places like Bhimlat Falls, Rameshwar Falls, Geparnath, Kota Barrage, Guda, Parajhar Mahadev, Gararia Mahadev and Cholia Falls is evidence of natureâ€™s splendour.

The animals found here include the wolf, sloth bear, sambar, caracal and panther. The graceful Chambal river glides through a thickly wooded forest area, adjacent to the hills. The Jawahar Sagar Sanctuary has panthers, wild boars and some birds of prey. Sorsan was once famous for black buck, crane and other wild animals. The cool weather makes the forest more lively. 

Similarly, the Ramgarh Sanctuary in Bundi is a single, compact and large ecosystem in this zone. It is a corridor to Ranthambore. Wild species visit the area quite often for breeding. The Talwas Lake and Kanak Sagar are home to many migratory and resident birds. 

A taste of the local maize roasted in a coal oven and served with salt and lemon in the rainy season always gives you a special feel of deluge. The presence of many bhutta sellers near the picnic spots is also a special feature of the monsoons here. The locals celebrate this season. Pilgrimages and festivities go together with special devotion to Lord Shiva. The womenfolk also celebrate shravani amavasya, haryali teej and other festivals during this season. 

These less frequented sanctuaries have, in a way, grown well because of low human intervention . To view wildlife in its natural cover, these sanctuaries offer a decent range of sightseeing options .
