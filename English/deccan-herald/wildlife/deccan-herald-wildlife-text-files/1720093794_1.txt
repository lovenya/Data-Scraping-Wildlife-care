There is a new attraction on the outskirts of Dharwad — a frog park, perhaps the first of its kind in the state. The park has been built with the intention of helping frog enthusiasts conduct research on amphibians. It will also serve as a breeding spot and help to increase the population of some rare species. The park is situated at Nature First Eco-Village, an eco-education centre, in Halligeri. ADVERTISEMENTEnvironmentalists were encouraged to set up the park after a recent survey conducted at the Karnatak University Dharwad and Nature First Eco-Village saw the participation of 41 citizen scientists, who identified 19 species of frogs that are rare to this region.Also Read:Study reveals impact of mining conveyor systems on wildlife in Ballari forestsAlso Read:Study reveals impact of mining conveyor systems on wildlife in Ballari forests<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2023-08%2F14d916dc-694a-4274-ac79-97a064681ce8%2Ffile7r99gl1acc8klsph55g.jpg?w=1200" alt="Fungoid frog "/>Fungoid frog Credit: DH Photo Bengaluru-based batrachologist KV Gururaj said, “Nowadays, citizen scientists are playing a crucial role at the community level. Dharwad citizens, too, have joined in this initiative. Such grassroots-level documentation helps research in the long run.”The frog species documented by the team include Duttaphrynus melanostictus, Raorchestes bombayensis, Hoplobatrachus tigerinus, Minervarya caperata, Microhyla rubra, Microhyla ornata, the common toad, Ferguson’s toad and the common skittering frog.<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2023-08%2F47b84424-784e-47d3-b891-6f792efff924%2Ffile7r99gazzkpt17u2y78g4.jpg?w=1200" alt="Citizen scientists document frog species at Halligeri village on the outskirts of Dharwad.

Zoologists will also benefit from the batracharium (frog park). “We will also launch micro-grants and fellowships for citizen scientists who do field work and submit a report,” Hiremath said.
