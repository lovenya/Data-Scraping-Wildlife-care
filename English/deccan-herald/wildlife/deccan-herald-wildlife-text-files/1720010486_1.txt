Night safari at Bannerghatta

The State Cabinet also decided to start night safari at Bannerghatta National Park. Acharya said once the Rs 178 crore project is in place nature lovers can take a ride through a night safari to sight nocturnal wildlife.

The infrastructure at the park would be refurbished and developed into one of the best night safari venues in the world.

For the record, the project was first mooted in 2002 and various models for development have since been doing the rounds, butÂ  nothing concrete has emerged so far.ADVERTISEMENT
