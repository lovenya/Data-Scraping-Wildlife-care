The High Court said on Tuesday that it would not interfere in matter of the golden howdah being carried by a elephant in the Dasara procession, if there is no violation of any law. ADVERTISEMENTThe court’s observation comes a day after it suggested the government to think of having a lighter howdah, instead of the 750-kg gold howdah. 

Hearing a suo motu PIL about man-elephant conflicts, a division bench comprising of Chief Justice D H Waghela and Justice B V Nagarathna directed the government to submit an affidavit that there will be no violation of Section 12 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act during the Dasara procession. The bench observed that it was the primary duty of the person in charge of the festival to protect the elephants.

The bench said that it is important to avoid human-elephant conflicts and to implement projects to protect the elephants.  There must be no problem caused to the elephants due to humans and vice-versa, the bench observed. The bench also directed the government to submit a report on action to be taken to avert human-elephant conflict and the precautionary measures to be taken.Government counsel Ravindra Kolle submitted to the court that there was no burden on the elephant as carrying the howdah is a customary practice and a religious and cultural ritual. 

Earlier, the Maharaja of Mysore was being carried on the howdah and taken on a procession, now the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari is taken on a procession. It is no problem or torture to an elephant weighing 4,000-5,000 kg to carry the howdah weighing 750 kg, the counsel submitted.
