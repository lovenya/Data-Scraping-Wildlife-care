Kundapur Forest Division had taken action based on the complaint from Janapara Vedike State Secretary Sriram Diwana which stated, “Swamiji had caged the deer, which should have been living freely in its natural habitat, for the last three months, violating the Wildlife Protection Act.”

As per the Vedike Swamiji had committed a crime by rearing deer in the mutt, much against the Act which prohibits it. 

Vedike informed that Swamiji in the past had brought a turtle to the mutt and the animal was later released to the ocean based on a complaint filed by a voluntary organisation.
