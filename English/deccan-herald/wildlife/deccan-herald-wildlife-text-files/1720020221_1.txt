The best teachers teach from the heart, not from the book. Would you agree?

While most of them chose “safe” professional courses like Medicine and Engineering, there were a few who were rather original. For example, young Sumeet said, without batting an eyelid, that he wanted to become the President of India. Plucky Yogesh wanted to be an astronaut, while tall Shashwitha said she wanted to be an air hostess.

I was a trifle dismayed that not one student had mentioned that he or she wanted to become a teacher. Teaching has always been regarded as an overworked job, but on the bright side it is also one of the noblest professions in the world.

I thought of all the wonderful teachers who inspired me when I was a child.I remember my Class VII class teacher, Miss Susheela Mani, who took us to the movie, ‘To Sir, With Love’, starring Sydney Poiter as Mr Braithwaite. I remember how we wept copiously when the title song was played (‘Those school days of telling tales and biting nails are gone/ but in my mind they live on and on’) Finally, when Mr Braithwaite leaves the school after winning countless hearts, I am sure there was not one dry eye in the entire audience.
Other movies, such as ‘Educating Rita’, ‘Taare Zameen Par’ and ‘Sur’, also tell one a great deal about the intrinsic worth of caring teachers.

I see teaching as a way of moulding minds like clay and chiseling perfect attitudes, like a sculptor sculpting a statue. 

Young minds can be shaped to be cheerful and calm, and enlightened about the difference between right and wrong, and weak and strong.

A good teacher can bring a classroom to life and transport students to forests teeming with wildlife, vast expanses of the Thar Desert or white ice floes of the Arctic Circle! A good teacher can take students back in time to the Revolt of 1857, the Dandi March of 1931, or the Chauri Chaura incident of 1942.

A good teacher can inspire love for the written word too.

Remember the movie, ‘Mona Lisa Smile’? Julia Roberts, the protagonist, is a charming Art History teacher. She takes her students to museums in Europe, showing them colourful slides and even making them paint yellow lilies like Van Gogh did. As a teacher, she made them ‘beautiful-at-heart’ human beings. Yes, that is what teaching is all about.
