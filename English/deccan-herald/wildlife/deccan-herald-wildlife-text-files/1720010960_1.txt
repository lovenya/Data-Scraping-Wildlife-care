The island was one of three sites in Louisiana where they were reintroduced after pesticides erased them in the state in the 1960s. 

But recently, 29 of the birds, their feathers so coated in thick brown sludge that their natural white and gray colouring was totally obscured, were airlifted to a bird rehabilitation centre in Fort Jackson, the latest victims of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Another dozen were taken to other rescue centres. Six more pelicans were brought there a day later, and as visitors to the centre looked on, the birds huddled together in makeshift plywood cages and, in their unnatural stillness, looked as if the gooey muck had frozen them solid. The 29 pelicans were being treated in hot rooms by workers in protective clothing. “The pelicans are in dire trouble,” said Doug Inkley, a senior scientist with the National Wildlife Federation, who worried that the oil spill could put an end to the bird’s recovery in Louisiana. 

Reminiscent of Exxon disaster
The images of oil-covered birds – pelicans, northern gannets, laughing gulls and others – are eerily reminiscent of the Exxon Valdez disaster 21 years ago and in recent days have become the most vivid symbol of the damage wrought by the hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil that have poured into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20.  

Since the spill, 612 damaged birds had been catalogued, most dead but some alive and drenched in oil, Federal officials said. Yet the brown pelican, because of its history of robust recovery in the face of extreme peril, has a special significance for the public. The birds were once so common on the coastline here that they grace the state flag. They were frequent companions for fishermen, who shared their waters and admired their skill at spotting fish from afar and diving from great heights to scoop them up in their bills. At the turn of the 20th century, observers estimated the brown pelican population in Louisiana at close to 50,000. 

But by 1961, no nesting pair could be spotted along the state’s entire coast, according to LaCoast, a Coast Guard website. Like another subspecies of the brown pelican found in California, the local birds had been hard hit by DDT and other pesticides, which acted to thin the shells of their eggs. The eggs were crushed when the adults sat on them. (DDT was banned in the United States in 1972.) In 1968, Louisiana took birds from a surviving Florida colony and reintroduced them along the state’s southern coast in three spots. One was Queen Bess Island, which had been the site of one of the last breeding pairs before extinction, said Kerry St. Pe, program director of the nearby Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program. Still, the birds struggled, threatened by the loss of their habitat.  Queen Bess was going under as well until 1990, when a coastal restoration project financed a rock barrier around the island, which stabilised it. The pelican colony began to flourish, St. Pe said. 

Not on endangered species list
Last year, the birds were officially taken off the endangered species list. But the oil spill, experts said, could change that. Like all birds, pelicans are sensitive to oil, said Melanie Driscolldirector of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society’s Louisiana Coastal Initiative. It prevents them from regulating their body temperature when it gets on their feathers, she said, and in Louisiana the pelicans are subject to overheating. It can also poison the fish the pelicans feed on and seep through the shells of pelican eggs, killing the embryos. 

At the rescue centre set up by the International Bird Rescue Research Center with BP and federal and state officials, most of the birds were so thoroughly coated in crude that they could not stand up. Workers wiped off thick globs of oil with towels, gave them fluids and fed them a fish slurry. The pelicans were placed in plywood pens covered with blankets. Workers cleaned them with hot water and Dawn, a mild dish detergent. So far, even the most heavily oiled pelicans have survived. Had they not been treated immediately, however, they would have almost certainly drowned or died of starvation or exposure.
