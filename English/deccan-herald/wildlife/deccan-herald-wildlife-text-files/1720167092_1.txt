Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention to persuade the neighbouring Karnataka to declare the area around two wildlife sanctuaries in that state as eco-sensitive zones.

He has also alleged that the Congress-ruled Karnataka was "destroying" the ecology of Western Ghats.

"In a letter to the PM on July 18 I have requested for his intervention to ask Karnataka to declare area up to ten kilometres around the wildlife sanctuaries as eco-sensitive zones," Parsekar told PTI.

"We are concerned about the environmental degradation around Mhadeyi and Bhimgad wildlife sanctuaries which adjoin Goa," he said.

The two states are locked in a dispute over diversion of Mhadeyi river waters. The Goa cabinet had recently said Karnataka was constructing canals in the area around the two sanctuaries to divert the river water.

"I wish to draw your kind attention to the ongoing massive destruction of Western Ghats by Karnataka...," the CM said in the letter, alleging that Karnataka was also violating the wildlife and environmental laws.

Parsekar said he had requested the PM that the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest should ensure declaration of at least ten kilometres of eco-sensitive zone in and around both the sanctuaries.
