The work on  400 kv high-tension line at Lingadapura in Maldare forest commenced on Saturday. 

ADVERTISEMENTA team of 15 labourers felled trees using machines. The 400-kv high-tension line will be a part of wheeling power from Kudankulam nuclear power project. In the backdrop of protest, as a precautionary measure, the police had beefed up security at Forest Check Post in Maldare. Only Power Grid officials and labourers were allowed to enter inside the forest. The power line will pass through 1,750 metre inside the forest. As many as 600 trees are likely to be felled en route, said DFO Dhananjay. 

Power Grid officials said “additional labourers will be deployed to accelerate the work.” 
Virajpet Tahsildar Hanumanthappa, ACF Nagaraj, Kushalnagar RFO Acchappa, Revenue Officer Srinivas and others were present. 

Opposition

Members of Field Marshal Cariappa-General Thimmaiah Forum, Coorg Wildlife Society and Kaveri Sene have opposed the proposed work on high-tension line. 

Addressing a press meet, Major (retd) B A Nanjappa said that several trees will be felled. This will have an impact on the environment. 

River Cauvery depends on rain to quench the thirst of residents of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. Deforestation will result in imbalance in the nature. He said “at the same time, the project will affect Elephant Corridor. The government should suspend the work immediately.” 

He said instead of 400 kv high-tension line, the 230 kv line which passes through H D Kote-Bandipura-Nagarahole can be upgraded to 400 kv capacity.
