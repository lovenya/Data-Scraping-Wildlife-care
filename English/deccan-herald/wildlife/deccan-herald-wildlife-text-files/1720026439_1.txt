Continuing with its conservation education programme, Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens for its second chapter of the programme has decided to share expertise on ‘Natural History of Wild Dogs and India Grey Wolf and their role in eco-system’ on November 6 at 3 pm at its auditorium in the city.

ADVERTISEMENTRenowned wildlife photographers duo Krupakar and Senani, who have also won Green Oscar for their documentary ‘The Pack’ on ‘Dhol’ (wild dogs), will be speaking on the subject.

Mega carnivores like tiger, lion and leopard always attract a lot of attention and interest, however lesser carnivores like wild dogs, wolf, jackal, etc, have not been discussed very often. Even general public are less exposed to facts and behaviour of very important animals. It is a known fact that all animals have an important role to play in the eco-system. 
So it is an opportunity to learn from the distinguished field ecologists. 

Owing to space constraint, participation is limited for 200 persons on first come first serve basis with prior registration — free of cost — at zoomysore@gmail.com or through telephone (0821-2520302) on or before November 3, said a release from executive director of Zoo B P Ravi.
