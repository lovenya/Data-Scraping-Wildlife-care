The donation to the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary was made in the name of their eldest biological child, daughter Shiloh, who was born in the African country in 2006.

They returned this Christmas with Shiloh and her five siblings to the sanctuary, which looks after orphaned and injured animals, including lions, leopards, cheetahs and baboons.
The sanctuary, run by Dr Rudie van Vuuren and wife Marlice, were given the money through the couple's Jolie-Pitt Foundation, reported Daily Mirror online.

"We have known Rudie and Marlice for many years and continue to be impressed by their hard work and dedication to the people and conservation of the land and wildlife of Namibia," said 35-year-old Jolie in a press statement.

During their holiday, the couple's children helped the staff at the lodge to feed and care for baby baboons, foxes and saw a leopard released into the wild.ADVERTISEMENT
