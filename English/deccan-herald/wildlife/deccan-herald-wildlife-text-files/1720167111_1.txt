Madras Engineer Group (MEG) of Indian Army has been called in by the Chief Wildlife Warden to construct an improvised shelter to provide treatment for ailing elephant, Sidda. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe wild elephant has been unable to move due to its injury at the Manchanbele dam in Ramanagaram district.

A special task force, comprising an officer, a junior commissioned officer and 40 non-commissioned officers, was deployed at Averi Halli near Manchanbele dam on Monday to construct a shelter. 

The team was mobilised with large amount of stores including a contraption for lifting the elephant and keeping him standing to administer medicines and to assist during feeding.  Chief Wildlife Warden W B Hosmat said that this is one of the last efforts that the Forest department is making based on the request made by the wildlife vets treating Sidda. 

“Forest department cannot go on treating all wild elephants. Nature normally takes care of these animals. By chemical intervention through medicines, we have disturbed the nature’s flow and the animal’s metabolism. We are doing what is best for the animal, shifting the animal away from the public glare may cause more harm,” he added. Sidda fell into a trench and injured himself on August 29 in Kollur village while walking and was driven by the forest guards for nearly 15 km, only to ensure that he does not attack any locals.  

After having walked with a broken leg for 15 km, he entered the waters of Manchanbele Dam and refused to come out until he was lured with food.  He was pulled out of the waters and has been under treatment since October 21.
