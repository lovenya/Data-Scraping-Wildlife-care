The overflowing water bodies particularly in Cuddalore and Chidambaram taluks are also pushing these  crocodiles in fairly large numbers into heavily inundated areas by night, making them perilous guests to humans and cattle alike, reports reaching the State headquarters said here on Monday night. 

People are scared to wade through waist-deep water in the worst-affected pockets of Cuddalore and Chidambaram, lest they might be dragged away by these croocodiles. People in the affected villages have been sending “SOS” to the Wildlife Department to swing into action to trap these crocodiles and cart them away to safe forest areas. 

Meanwhile, Chief Minister  M Karunanidhi, who reviewed the flood situation in the State at a top-level officials meeting here on Monday evening, ordered the immediate release of Rs 3 lakhs to each of the family of the 103 pople killed by the heavy rain and floods so far. These will be disbursed from the National Calamity Relief Fund and Chief Minister's Public Relief Fund.ADVERTISEMENT
