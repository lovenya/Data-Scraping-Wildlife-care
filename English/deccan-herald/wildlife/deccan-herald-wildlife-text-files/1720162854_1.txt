With 60 per cent of the water bodies drying up in the month of March itself, people in rural areas are dependent on the water supplied through water tankers for the rest of the summer.

ADVERTISEMENTAdding to this is the power shortage. Rural areas are provided power only for three hours a day. According to ZP officials, it is not possible to fill the tanks and others in such a short time.

The depletion of water table is a cause for concern. About 5,000 litres of water was available from borewells per day, which has now reduced to 2,000 litres, having an impact on the people and livestock.

According to officials, no village in the district is facing acute shortage of water, but the water cannot be used due to load shedding. There are 5,441 borewells and 2,004 minor drinking water supply units in the district.

Currently, there are problems in Harave and Gundlupet and the ZP has made arrangements to supply water through tankers, officials said.

The water shortage has hit not only the people and livestock, but also wild animals in Bandipur National Park, Biligiriranganatha Tiger Reserve, Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, as water sources are turning dry.
