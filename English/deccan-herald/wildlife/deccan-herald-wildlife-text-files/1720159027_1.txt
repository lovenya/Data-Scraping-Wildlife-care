A group of around 10 suspected Naxals ransacked a forest checkpost at Tanikodu in the limits of the Kudremukh National Park near here, in the early hours of Monday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe ultras are reported to have fired two rounds in the air, before asking the staff inside to come out with their hands up. They then took away mobile phones in the possession of Veeresh, Shivaram and Mahesh, who were on duty at the checkpost. 

Four of the naxals’ group, including three women, then barged into the checkpost, brought out the records they could lay their hands on and set them on fire. The ultras then damaged lights, glass windowpanes and CCTV cameras. 

 The Maoists distributed pamphlets, containing slogans and a demand that the ‘harassment’ by forest officers on the residents of the National Park should stop. Suspected Naxals had set off a blast in the same checkpost in 2005. Sudarshan, Superintendent of Police of the Anti-Naxal Force, Srinath Kadolkar, range forest officer of the wildlife division, and other officers visited the spot. The dog squad also visited the spot.
