It also expressed fears that declaring wild boar as vermin may hit the existence of the species.As per 2002 data, the number of wild boars in Kerala was 60,940 and it came down to 48,034 in 2011, which was the last wild animal census by the Kerala forest department, FIAPO pointed out.In a representation sent to Union Forest Minister Prakash Javadekar and other top officials, the FIAPO suggested that instead of declaring wild boar as vermin, more focus should be given on setting up fences, digging well-replenished watering holes deep inside forests and providing enough feed to pre-empt wild animals from foraying into habitation centres during summer.
