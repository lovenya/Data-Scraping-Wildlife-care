Journalist Sunil Heggaravalli recorded his statement before the 14th Metropolitan Magistrate in Bengaluru on Thursday in connection with a case of 'Hi Bangalore' editor Ravi Belagere allegedly hiring hitman to eliminate him.ADVERTISEMENTHeggaravalli recorded his statement for nearly one hour. Later, speaking to reporters, he said that he gave some crucial details to the magistrate, which he can not revel to the media in the interest of the investigation.He said that he is not happy with the CCB's investigation into the case and alleged that they are under pressure from Belagere and not conducting thorough investigation.Heggaravalli said that when the CCB police raided Belagere's office-cum-house in Padmanabhanagar, they found deer skin and tortoise shell. But, the CCB police have not registered a case and are giving lame excuses that they have sent them to the Forest department lab for testing. Forest department has also not sent a report to the CCB. Earlier, the CCB had registered cases under Wildlife Protection Act in such cases, but are lenient now, he alleged.
