The Bear Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Bannerghatta National Park has received a female sloth bear and her cub, which were rescued from the City outskirts.

ADVERTISEMENTThe mother bear is being treated for grievous injuries.

Two teams of rescuers from the Forest Department and Wildlife SOS, a non-governmental organisation, rescued the mother bear trapped in a snare near Honnayyanapalya Bukkapatna in Tumkur district, recently. 

The trap had bitten into the left leg of the bear causing it grievous injuries. The cub was found unhurt by the side of the mother bear.

According to Tumkur Deputy Conservator of Forests, Amarnath, it took them an hour to free the bear from the trap.   
   “There are extensive bruises and fractures on the mother bear’s left arm and intensive treatment is going on,” said Dr Arun A Sha, senior veterinarian at the Bannerghatta Rescue Vet Centre.

“The injury has exposed bony fragments around the wound. We have been treating her at the Veterinary College, Hebbal. There are irreparable fractures and dislocations. All this is sure to leave the bear with a permanent disability and we have no choice but to rehabilitate the animal. The chances of releasing it into the wild is minimal,” he added.

Amputation

While all efforts are on to save the injured limb, doctors are considering amputation, if it does not heal, Sha said.

“We have invited a team from the surgery department of the Veterinary College, Hebbal, to look into the wounds. We hope we can avoid removing the limb. However, we will have to examine all possibilities,” Dr Arun said.  

With this addition, the centre houses 82 adult bears and two bear cubs.
