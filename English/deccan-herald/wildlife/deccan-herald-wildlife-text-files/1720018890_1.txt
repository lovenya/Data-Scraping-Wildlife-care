"The carcasses of 18 peacocks were found in the village on March 21. We suspect all these deaths took place due to poisoning but only autopsy report can confirm it", a senior official said.

A high level inquiry has also been ordered into the matter and the farmers on whose fields the carcasses have been found have been detained, the official said. Killing of peacocks, the national bird, is prohibited under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.ADVERTISEMENT
