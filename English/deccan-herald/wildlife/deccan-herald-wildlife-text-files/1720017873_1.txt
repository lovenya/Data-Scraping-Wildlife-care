The project, which incurred  the wrath of  environmentalists,  had also sparked off controversy with the BJP government in Gujarat putting the blame squarely on the UPA government for the 11-year delay.

Politicis apart, it was the visit of Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh to the site that   led to the speedy approval of the project, with some conditions to address the concerns of the environmentalists. 

The project will have to meet six specific conditions that include minimum disturbance for the Girnari Giddh habitat, a cafeteria for vultures, increase in height of two towers along the ropeway and cess on ticket revenue turnover for conservation related activities. The matter of construction of the ropeway from Bhavnath Taleti to Ambaji Temple in the Girnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Junagarh was under the consideration of the Ministry of Environment and Forests for over an year. 

Earlier, a technical group of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife   had raised concerns that the project might lead to the  extinction of the “Girnari Giddh,” an endangered species. After a visit to the site in last December, the committee advised against the construction of  ropeway.
