In a meeting convened by District-in-Charge Minister Suresh Kumar at Kudremukh on Friday night, a delegation led by Taluk Panchayat member Sheshagiri appealed the minister on the same. 

They said the people had lot of confusion when Kudremukh National Park was declared. “If the government gives World Heritage Site tag to Kudremukh National Park without consulting the locals, then we will have to start a struggle against it,” they said. 

The minister held talks on eco tourism in Kudremukh with the KIOCL President and senior officials.  The locals said about 3,400 hectare land has been declared as deemed forest in Kalasa hobli. The declaration has created problems to the people. They urged the minister to withdraw the declaration. The Minister promised to take suitable decision at a meeting with the Deputy Commissioner on April 29.  

The Elaneeru villagers said that the government has not developed Samse-Elaneeru-Belthangady road. When the locals said that the forest department is coming in the way of the construction of a bridge on Kudremukh-Karkala state highway, the Minister visited the spot on Saturday and directed Kudremukh Wildlife division ACF not to come in the way of the construction of the bridge.
