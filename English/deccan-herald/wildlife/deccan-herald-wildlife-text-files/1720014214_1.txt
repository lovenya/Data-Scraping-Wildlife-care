"Seahorses, found mainly in shallow tropical temperate waters, prefer to live in sheltered area, and are being exploited for a variety of purpose including medicinal," the officials said adding the species was considered to be an important component of Chinese country medicine.

Pollution, trawling and exploitation for commercial purpose and habitat destruction had led to a steep fall in the population of seahorse. Seahorse captive culture was taken up in order to increase their population. Though sea horse breeding was not a complex one, there was need to provide sufficient quantities of nutritionally balanced live food, the officials said.

The forest Department took up the project at a cost of Rs 1.5 lakh and funded it on a trial basis. Wildlife Warden of Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Research and National Park Sundarakumar said priority was being given to the project to enhance the depleted population of seahorses. The fishermen were also being requested to protect the seahorse, which are also used for ornamental purpose.ADVERTISEMENT
