The birth of an Asiatic lion cub at the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens in the City on July 29 was a cause for joy.

On Thursday, there was more bad news in store. A cheetah cub died at the zoo. Gowri and Shankara are the proud parents of the newborn lion cub. 

The lions had been brought to the city last year from Shakkar Bagh zoo at Junagarh in Gujarat by ex-cricketer, Anil Kumble, as part of an animal exchange programme. 

Kumble, who is also the vice-chairman of Karnataka Wildlife Board, had taken the help of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in getting the lions. 

In exchange, the Mysore zoo sent a pair of Indian Gaurs and birds to the Gujarat zoo. 

Asiatic lions are currently on the endangered list. Their habitat is restricted to the Gir forest in Gujarat. With the birth of the cub, however, zoo veterinarians expressed confidence that the Mysore climate may be conducive for future breeding.

Deaths

The Capuchin monkey, which had been brought from the Czech Republic five months ago, died of the injuries it sustained in a fall. Its young one, born recently, also died as it was deprived of the mother’s milk. 

The cheetah cub which died on Thursday was one of the surviving cubs of Maya, a cheetah which had died of a nervous problem a few months ago. Two of its five siblings had died previously, forcing the zoo to bring in an expert, Dr G Pampapathi of Bangalore.

Pampapathi said there were two possible reasons for the deaths: nutritional deficiency or a nervous weakness. 

“Nervous system-related diseases usually lead to a fatal brain tumour,” Pampapathi said.

Following the spate of deaths at the zoo, authorities have taken precautions to ensure that Gowri and her cub remain in good health.
