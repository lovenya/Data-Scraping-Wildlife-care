In a new move, the Forest Department has decided to insure its lower division staff for the remainder of their life. Previously, many of these employees had been ineligible for incentives or welfare measures.

ADVERTISEMENTThe State Wildlife Board, headed by Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar on Saturday, cleared the forest department’s proposal to mandatorily insure guards, watchers, rangers and foresters working in the five tiger divisions and wildlife sanctuaries in Karnataka.

 While the Project Tiger Foundation will bear the expenses for its staff serving in tiger reserves, the forest department will take on the task of insuring its staff in the other wildlife ranges. 

As many as 2,500 forest officials will be insured for a sum of Rs 2 lakh each. Already, some 471 officials in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve have been insured by the Oriental Insurance company. Proposals have been made to adopt the measures in the other divisions as well. 

Forest Minister C P Yogeeshwara, who announced this, also said that the chief minister had approved the recruitment of 300 new watchers, and that the file had been moved to the Finance Department for its approval. “The department is serious about evicting resorts and mini-hydel projects in the protected forest areas,” he added.

Anil Kumble, the vice-chairman of the Board said that the Board had discussed the issue of man-animal conflict plaguing the State, and that a team of officials will be sent to South Africa to study measures adopted there.
