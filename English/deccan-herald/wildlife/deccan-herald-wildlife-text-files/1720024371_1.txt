The scientific community has stressed that the Unesco heritage tag for 39 sites in the Western Ghats should further boost conservation efforts.

With 7,95,315 hectares declared “heritage”, experts say the onus is now on the government to protect the sites, as the whole world looks towards it now. “We welcome the declartion. But we don’t want the government to sit on the report. The government has said it is committed to conserving forests... We only hope for it,” said senior ecologist Madhav Gadgil.

Dr K Ullas Karanth, a leading wildlife biologist who has worked in Kudremukh National Park on the conservation of lion-tailed macaque, and tiger conservation in various places in the region, expressed concern that despite the unique biodiversity value of the region, it was not recognised by the local people.

The rapid economic growth has endangered the region, he said. “Highway projects and attempts to push power projects in the region have put the unique biodiversity to great danger. But the world heritage tag can surely bring about some changes,” he said.

Dr M D Subhash Chandran, a senior scientist who has worked on conservation of primeval forests in the Western Ghats, hopes that reckless development in the region will be stopped.ADVERTISEMENTMany rivers originate in the Western Ghats, he said. There is a need to protect the forest patch and the Unesco world heritage tag will definitely do the needful, he added.

Sanjay Gubbi, a wildlife expert says, “It (the tag) will get enhanced recognition for the conservation of tiger, lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri tahr and scores of other species. It will now be important for the governments to recognise the fact that we should continue to protect and sustain the only World Heritage site in the whole of South India.”
