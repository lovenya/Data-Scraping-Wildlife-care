This book was released recently in the City too.

‘On Safari: The Tiger and the Baobab Tree’ richly illustrates the finest of wildlife photography in India and Africa. The book consists of breathtaking shots by the author on the rugged terrains of Kanha, Ranthambore, Bandhavgarh, Corbett, Nepal and the Sunderbans. It also has pictures of lions, cheetahs, buffaloes, rhinos, elephants and other animals captured in Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa over the last two decades.

“Photographing wildlife, especially dangerous species in their natural environment, has always been my passion. ‘On Safari : The Tiger and the Baobab Tree’ reflects the many years of my adventure in the wilderness of Africa and the jungles of India.

 My wife Tina undertook the production of this book and selectively chose the photographs from my archival collection of thousands and thousands of photographs, both emulsion and digital. Every photograph taken is firmly etched in my memory and I relive every moment even as I go through my book,” said Babi Nobis.

“The book is a collection of memories. To me, these photographs are awe-inspiring and putting the book together has been not only been terribly exciting but a labour of love. I am my husband’s biggest fan and critic,” said Tina Nobis.

Speaking on the launch, Keertan Adhyanthaya, Managing Director, National Geographic Channel Network (India) said, “Nat Geo Wild is pleased to associate with Babi Nobis in his endeavour to showcase the stunning wildlife of our planet. ‘On Safari...’, like the shows on Nat Geo Wild, encourages people to care about our animal kingdom through the use of spectacular visuals and compelling storytelling. 

Uniting with like-minded causes such as this helps the channel engage and inspire all to preserve the amazing creatures that inhabit our world.”
