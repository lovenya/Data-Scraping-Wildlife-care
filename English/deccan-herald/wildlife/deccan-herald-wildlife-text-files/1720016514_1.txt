Crop destroyed

According to villagers, a herd of elephants raided a agriculture field and destroyed standing maize crop on the wee hours of Thursday. 

It is suspected that the elephant might have succumbed on the spot when a aggrieved person or a farmer opened fire on the herd using a pistol. Conservator of Forest Hosamath, DCF Keshav, forest officer Ravi and others visited the spot.

Dr Srinivas who conducted the autopsy on the elephant carcass said a bullet was removed from the head portion of the carcass. 

Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife Warden B K Singh said that the tusker was shot from a close range and had died instantly. The massive beast strayed out of the forest for the first time.

There have been number of instances of elephants straying out of forest and getting killed in the State.
