It has been seven years since a drinking water project was announced to Kalasa. But not a single drop of water has reached the people of this town. The residents of Kalasa town are eagerly waiting for water supply from Honnekadu stream, to quench their thirst.

ADVERTISEMENTThe proposal for the Honnekadu water project was prepared in 2007. In the first phase, the work on dam and pipelines at an estimated cost of Rs 2.62 crore was taken up. However, the work was stalled after the forest department raised objections stating that the work site where the dam was constructed belongs to the wildlife division.

Even after four years of stalling the work, the work has not commenced. The residents have staged several protests demanding the completion of the water project.

The ZP Engineering division has written a letter to the wildlife division of the forest department seeking permission to restart the work. However, the officials are yet to get clearance for the work. 

The disruption in supply of electricity in the last few days has aggravated the water crisis in Kalasa. At present, water is lifted from Bhadra river to supply water to the residents. However, during summer, water is supplied on alternate days. 

“If Honnekadu water project is materialised, then the residents will get water throughout the year,” said the residents.  The people of Kalasa attribute to the lack of foresight of the engineering department and elected representatives in completing the work.  Kalasa is a major tourist hub and hundreds of visitors visit the town daily. Without the supply of water, public toilets have been emanating staunch smell. Supplying water to cook mid-day meals have become a challenge for the teachers in anganwadi centres and schools.
