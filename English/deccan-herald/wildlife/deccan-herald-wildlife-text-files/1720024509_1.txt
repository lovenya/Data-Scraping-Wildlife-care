The fun and frolic by tourists at Muthodi nature camp in Bhadra Tiger Reserve has finally been curtailed. 

ADVERTISEMENTIn response to the report on the parties ‘Nature camp turns into ‘messy’ that was published in Deccan Herald on Monday, Bhadra Wildlife Reserve Department Conservator of Forest Krishna Udupudi has ordered for a ban on any human activities within Muthodi nature camp zone with effect from July 22, in accordance with the Supreme Court order.

Responding to the report, Krishna Udupudi said that the report has opened the Department’s eyes. “We regret that such activities were taking place in the eco-sensitive zone like Muthodi. 

Though we used to check the visitors before letting them inside the nature camp, a few visitors used to gain entry without the notice of the forest officers and staff. We will ensure that such activities would not repeat again,” he has assured. 

He has further stated that no activities should take place in Muthodi which is in the heart of the reserve forest. “As it is our responsibility to create a congenial atmosphere for the animals, we had written a letter to the higher officials requesting for the ban on human activities in the region.

 Now with the Supreme Court ordering for the ban on tourism and safari in tiger reserves across the nation with an objective to save the tigers, our decision has received a strength,” he said.

“The Department has realised that as Muthodi core of the reserve forest, it is not right on our part to operate nature camps, Department quarters and offices here. The process of shifting the nature camp from Muthodi region has started and will be carried out in different phases. We are looking out for land outside the core area,” said the officer.

In response to the Department’s decision, wild life activist G Veeresh has urged the Department to stop the tourism activities completely. The order should not be limited to words, but it should be brought in to action.
