Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens is organising a two-day teachers training programme for PU and High School teachers from August 26 to create awareness about the conservation activities and captive management techniques.

ADVERTISEMENTProf K S Rangappa, Vice-chancellor, University of Mysore will inaugurate the programme. Member Secretary, Zoo Authority of Karnataka, R S Suresh, will preside.

A release from Executive Director of Zoo B P Ravi stated that the conservation of natural resources and wildlife requires correct understanding and awareness of issues related to forests, wildlife and environment. 

“The best way to spread the message of conservation is to organize intensive orientation programmes. Teachers play an important and integral role in creating awareness at school and college level about conservation of natural resources and wildlife. Zoos are the centers of ex-situ conservation, and act as the store house of biodiversity,” the release stated.

The zoo here houses more than 165 animal species belonging to five continents. Exposure to these animal species with their housing, food habits, and landscape, would help the participants relate theoretical aspects more effectively.

Special initiatives like plastic eradication, rain water harvesting, vermicompost, solid waste management and information on flora and fauna of the western ghats found in the Zoo, would be discussed and demonstrated, to help analyse the strategies of practical conservation measures which could be repeated elsewhere.
