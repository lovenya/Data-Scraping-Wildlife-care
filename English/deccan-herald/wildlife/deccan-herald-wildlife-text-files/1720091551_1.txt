The team returned to the field and placed the cubs in a safe box. In the early hours of Friday morning, camera traps installed to monitor the cubs captured the mother leopard approaching the safe box and reuniting with her cubs.Dr Chandan Sawne, Veterinary Officer, Wildlife SOS said: “We conducted a clinical examination to rule out any abnormality or disease. Following protocol, we also carefully implant each cub with a microchip before the release. This is an excellent measure of identifying leopards in the wild and allows us to study the range and territory of the majestic big cats.”Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS said: “Community-based conservation is the most important tool for mitigating human-wildlife conflict. Thus, the awareness of the local community plays a huge role here in avoiding any kind of mishap and ensuring that these cubs are safely reunited with their mothers.”
