We have sanctioned development projects worth over Rs 1 lakh crore for the state," Modi said."The previous governments did not have this thinking. Be it in Uttarakhand or elsewhere, the previous government only thought of filling their own coffers."Modi talked about the implementation of 'one rank, one pension' for ex-servicemen, buying modern weapons for the armed forces and giving a fitting reply to terrorists. He also spoke about how his government had built hundreds of kilometres of border roads.Assembly polls in Uttarakhand are slated for early next year. Check out DH's latest videos
