Going sightseeing in Bengaluru and its surroundings is now hassle-free. The Tourism Department and the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) are offering customised local sightseeing trips under the banner ‘Bengaluru detours’.

The first-of-a- kind initiative includes picking up guests at their doorstep, provision of tour guides, refreshments and lunch. The KSTDC will also work exclusively with cab aggregator Ola in this initiative.

Launched on a pilot basis, KSTDC is offering two types of city tour packages - ‘Bengaluru-Nandi Tour’ and ‘Wildlife of Bengaluru’ to Nandi Hills and Bannerghatta Biological Park with jungle safari, respectively.

Depending on the size of the group of tourists, customers can book sedans or SUVs. Bookings should be done at least two days in advance, so as to enable proper car and guide support. The bookings can be made on KSTDC’s official website — www.kstdc.co, officials said.

Also available are outstation detours which include Bengaluru-Mysuru-Madikeri and back, Bengaluru-Ooty via Mysuru, Bengaluru-Hampi via Chitradurga, Bengaluru-Shravanabelagola-Belur-Halebid and back.

Tourism Minister Priyank Kharge said: “This is for the first time that the corporation has taken the initiative to bring tourism to the doorstep of tourists and help them plan their journey, choose the most suitable package and experience the curated tour which adds value to their holiday.”ADVERTISEMENT
