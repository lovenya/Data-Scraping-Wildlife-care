“Fahrenheit is a series of intensely fought competitions that we look forward to each year and epitomises the action, thrill and intelligence we associate with the ever 
popular fictional character James Bond,” say the students enthusiastically.

The range of competitions were varied and diverse and encompassed different genres. It began with an inaugural dance that set the mood for the rest of the events to follow. The inaugural presentation gave the gathering a glimpse into what was to come in the next two days.

Kicking off the cultural panorama was instrumental fusion – which was won by Vinod Shyam and Narayan Sharma. 

Next came the ever popular dumb charades that kept the audience guessing as much as the participants.

A wonderfully enlightening presentation ‘Pugmark’ helped raise an awareness of the audience on the crisis situation that our highly endangered national animal is facing. 
The presentation was well-researched and put together with inputs from well-known wildlife experts and sources in the country. 

Western vocals kept the mood and the tempo upbeat. The first place in the competition went to Namitha.

 JAM (Science-O- Talk) had students showcasing their indepth knowledge on science related topics. Rohith, Nihal and Abhilash emerged ultimate winners after several well-contested rounds.

A series of crowd-pleasing contests had Varsha winning the title of Jain College Idol and Malini getting the prize for the Indian Filmi dance contest.

“We put a lot of effort into keeping up the spirit and tempo of Fahrenheit 007 and are delighted to see that it has grown each year from strength to strength,” says Charith, a final year BCom student and part of the organising committee. 

“The group dance and ethnic show have been some of the most popular events of the fest. We took a lot of trouble with the colourful costumes and styles. Students from 
various departments of the college were given an opportunity to showcase their talents and prepare for the forthcoming inter-collegiate festival.”ADVERTISEMENT
