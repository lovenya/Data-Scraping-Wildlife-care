The Anti-naxal Force (ANF) personnel exchanged fire with suspected naxals during combing operations at Palligadde in Kulkunda near Subramanya on Sunday evening. The ultras are said to have fled following the skirmishes.

ADVERTISEMENTThe ANF had intensified search operations following reports that the naxals visited a few homes in the forest on Saturday. The people in Kulkunda are terrified and many are fleeing for the homes of relatives.

 Those left behind are staying indoors. The naxals oppose the formation of the Pushpagiri wildlife sanctuary and demand that those with more than 10 acres of land should share it with the poor.

Their other demands include that Forest department should give forest produce to the locals. 

Meanwhile, ANF commander Alok Kumar has confirmed the exchange of fire between the ANF personnel and naxals.

He told Deccan Herald that the ANF personnel confronted a group of about five naxals. The naxals opened fired at the ANF personnel first, following which the ANF retaliated.

 “As the exchange of gun fire took place amidst thick forest and it was late evening, the ANF could not trace the naxals who fled from the spot.

 No ANF personnel was injured in the incident and there is no information about injuries to naxals. We will get a detailed picture Monday morning. After that I will visit the spot,” he said.
