He called on countries to come up with strategies, and cooperate with international agencies such as Interpol, to end poaching and illegal trade in tiger products.
"We must admit that we have failed miserably," Wijnstekers said at the two-week conference in the Gulf state of Qatar.

"Although the tiger has been prized throughout history ... it is now literally on the verge of extinction."Tigers are poached for their skins and parts of their bodies are prized for decoration and traditional medicine.Delegates at the UN conference will also consider the spike in rhino poaching and ways to combat criminal networks involved in the illegal trade in horns in parts of Africa and Asia.ADVERTISEMENT
