To attract the IT crowd, eco-tourism units will be set up in forests surrounding Bangalore, like Turahalli, to serve as getaways for them, said Minister V S Acharya. 

ADVERTISEMENTBriefing reporters after the State Cabinet gave its nod to constitute Karnataka Eco-Tourism Development Board to develop and operate eco-tourism and wildlife tourism, here on Thursday, he said the Board, to be headed by the Forest Minister, will develop eco-tourism hubs across the State and frame guidelines to ensure that these hubs do not disturb wildlife or ecological balance.

 The aim is to curtail disturbances in the protected areas and will help the Forest department check encroachment. 

He said the board would raise funds through certifying eco-tourism units, encourage private participation in eco-tourism and collect entry fees,  which in turn could be utilised by the forest department to provide facilities and take up conservation activities. 

Additional Chief Secretary, Forests, Kaushik Mukherjee, said the Board will regulate  eco-camps, resorts and even home stays.
