What took researcher Samira Agnihotri to BR Hills? One bird, the greater racket-tailed drongo, and its song. Her quest brought her face-to-face with the Soligas, whose help she took to track the drongo’s movements, reports Lakshman T Naik

Samira walks the forest relentlessly till noon, listening to birdsong. Her ears and eyes are all focussed on one bird, the greater racket-tailed drongo.

The moment she spots the bird perching on one of the branches, she records its song. 

She also discretely shoots pictures of the bird. Every move of the bird is under close watch, from what it feeds on, to when it eats. The relationship between her and the bird is so close that at times, one is not sure whether the bird is tracking her or vice-versa.
 
Deep into the forest

Samira has been following the bird from the last five years, and as she herself admits, it will take another two decades if she has to feel fully satisfied about her work.

As my friend Manju and I walked the road that pierces through BR Hills and provides connectivity to Chamarajanagar, the researcher and conservationist signalled to us not to raise our voices, and led us to the tree where the bird was busy feeding its young. 

Samira not once averted her gaze from the bird. Even the Soligas and other tribals in the region are wonderstruck by the woman’s love for the drongo. Samira, who hails from Vadodra in Gujarat, has been researching bio-diversity in the dense Western Ghats region. It has been five years since she has been tracking the bird. Her research thesis is entitled ‘Acoustic adaptation hypothesis in birds’. 

Samira is originally from Uttar Pradesh, though she was raised in Vadodra. Her father Arun Agnihotri is a well-known artist. Samira first came to Bangalore to pursue her post-graduation at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in 2004. During her post-graduation, she attended a two-week workshop on biodiversity conservation organised by ATREE. It was during this workshop that she caught a glimpse of the greater racket-tailed drongo, also called karali by Soligas and dodda karali by Girijanas of the region. Samira was smitten by the bird, ever since. Following the completion of the workshop, she headed to the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, where she decided to pursue her Ph D. It was in 2007 that Samira went to BR Hills to pursue her research, aided by ATREE. She hired two people to help her, both from the local communities.

Why this bird...

Why she chose this bird is a question one is compelled to ask Samira. The greater racket-tailed drongo is mostly spotted in the rainforests of the Western Ghats. The BR Hills has at least 900 of these birds, which can also be spotted in Honnavar, Bandipur, Dandeli and Sirsi.

What attracted Samira to the bird was its sound and behaviour. The bird is said to make 38 different types of sounds, sometimes mimicking other species, according to Samira. 
Samira says there is a strong reason why the bird makes so many sounds. On of them is self-defence. The other is to look for food.

This search for the drongo has also brought Samira in close association with the Soligas and the locals. 

Samira can speak Kannada well; well enough to put even a true-blue Kannadiga to shame. 

EARLY ADVENTURES

* Those were early days in Samira’s hunt for the drongo. Her guide, Jadeswamy, led her into the forest, gesticulating to her as he walked. 

The two of them had traversed half the forest, when they came face-to-face with a huge and aggressive elephant. Samira didn’t know how to climb a tree, and Jadeswamy was in no position to desert her and flee the scene. The elephant started to chase them, as they made their way through the bushes. As they reached the main door, they came face to face with a herd of elephants. The lone tusker retracted and the duo somehow managed to reach safety.

* BRT Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected reserve under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Because it is at the confluence of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats, the sanctuary is home to eco-systems that are special to both the regions. 

* The site was declared a Tiger Reserve in December 2010. This region has traditionally been home to the Soligas, a tribe. 

* The Soligas are traditionally known to be nature worshippers and hold a large ‘champaka’ tree (called ‘dodda sampige’) in the local language in great esteem.
