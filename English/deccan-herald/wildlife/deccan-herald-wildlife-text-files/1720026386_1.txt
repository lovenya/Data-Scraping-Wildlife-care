The road at Aanechowkur is in deplorable condition with huge potholes welcoming the visitors. The road is situated between Hanasoor and Gonikoppa.

ADVERTISEMENT It passes through Aanechowkoor reserve forest and Nagarahole Wildlife sanctuary. 

The road is crying for attention with the sheer negligence of the elected representatives. There is no road from Alloor of Piriyapattana taluk to the border of Aanechowkoor. The 10-km stretch is filled with potholes. 

Without any alternative, hundreds of vehicle users use the stretch daily.

The road has not seen any development for the last 20 years. The authorities fill the potholes by dumping mud during summer.

Â However, the road gets converted into a slushy field during monsoon. 

The road is the gateway for South Kodagu.

 The residents of Gonikoppa, Ponnampet, Srimangala, Virajpet use the road. The road provides connectivity to Kannur, Talacherry, Iritti as well.
