A tiger attacked and killed a farmer at Vadayanapura near Hediyala in the Nanjangud taluk, outside the Bandipur Tiger Reserve, on Tuesday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe deceased has been identified as Nagaraju (40), alias Javaraiah. 

Locals said Nagaraju, accompanied by Shivanna and Venkatesh, was grazing cattle on a field, when the tiger pounced on him and dragged him by the neck towards a nearby forest.
Shivanna and Venkatesh shooed the tiger back into the forest. Nagaraju sustained injuries on his neck, face and ear, and later died. He is survived by wife Chennamma, daughter Ashwini and son Harshan. 

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Ravi Ralph told Deccan Herald the incident occurred around 11 am 50 metres outside the Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The tiger strayed outside the forest, which has a high tiger population, in search of cattle. There have been cases of tiger attacks on cattle in the region in the past, he added. 

Though the Forest Department has dug a 15-foot feed trench and erected a solar fence, wild animals stray into the village as the fence is damaged.
