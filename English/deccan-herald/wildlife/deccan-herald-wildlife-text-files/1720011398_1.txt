“Immediate steps will be taken to stop the works. The issue will be discussed with the Forest officials of Dakshina Kannada also. I will personally conduct a spot inspection. A case will be booked against the people behind the act under Forest Conservation Act 1980,” he said.

“Whoever has done the road work, it is wrong. One cannot touch even a single plant in the reserve forest area without the department’s permission. If a road is constructed without bringing the same to the notice of the department, it is certainly an offense. They will definitely face the consequences,” the AFC warned.

3-km road

Reports had been published in a section of the media on Wednesday that road works were being held near Bairapura Nanyabhairaveshwara Temple in Balur reserve forest of Mudigere taluk for the past few days, regarding which the Forest department had no information. The 3-km long road cames under Balur and Miyar reserve forests.

The Supreme Court has clearly ruled that no non-forest activity can be allowed inside a forest. If some activity should be carried out inevitably, then, prior permission should be obtained from the State and the Central Environment and Forest Ministries.

However, Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust’s D V Girish and Mudigere Nature Club’s Dhanjay alleged that such guidelines have not been followed in the present case. Several environmentalists questioned that how could a road project be taken up in a reserve forest without the knowledge of the Forest officials.

“The protection and maintenance of reserve forests is the responsibility of the Forest department. The Forest officials of Chikmagalur and Dakshina Kannada districts have completely failed in delivering their service. Disciplinary actions should be taken against them,” urged Sridev Hulikere of ‘WildCat C’.

The Balur-Miyar reserve forest is usually identified as a corridor connecting the coastal belt and Malnad geographically. The forest here is so dense that the sun rays do not touch the surface of the earth in any time of the year. They are evergreen, cool and thick.
Environmentalist Veeresh said the evergreen forests will be destroyed completely one day if the present trend of non-forest activities continue in the forest areas. The trend will directly affect the water resources of Netravathi and that of Dakshina Kannada, he worried.
