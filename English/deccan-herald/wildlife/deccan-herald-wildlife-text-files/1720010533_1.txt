Addressing the inaugural of the 53rd wildlife week at the nature camp here on Saturday, he said Kudremukh should be protected if Bhadra, the lifeline of Karnataka, should continue to flow. One should be careful enough about the people looting the forests in the name of the tribal members. Tribals have not remained mere tribals these days. The form of knowledge has changed from generation to generations. One should think in a novel way regarding the welfare of tribals at least from now onwards, he observed.

“The lower level staff in the Forest department should be provided with good remuneration, insurance coverage and medical facilities. It is not proper that the government neglects the Forest department on the one hand and provides good facilities to the anti-Naxal forces on the other,” Girijashankar said.ADVERTISEMENT
