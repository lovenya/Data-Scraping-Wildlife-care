Taking a cue from the closure of road through Bandipur and Nagarhole Tiger Reserves, conservationists want a similar ban on some more such roads.

According to Wildlife Biologist Sanjay Gubbi, mitigation measures need to be introduced on NH-4A which passes through Hemadge-Khanapur, the State Highway through Shiradi Ghat, the roads through Bisle Ghat and Agumbe Ghat. He was speaking to Deccan Herald on the sidelines of screening of the film 'Finding the Middle Path’- which deals with closure of the road through Bandipur Tiger Reserve during night time and a discussion on the importance of such measures.

Admitting that the closure of road through Bandipur Tiger Reserve was not being implemented strictly, Gubbi said that the State government had asked an expert committee to study the impact of road closure and submit a report on August 2015. The panel has already submitted its report and it has been forwarded to the Union government. 

Former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, B K Singh admitted that there were cases of forest officials being lenient and allowing vehicles to pass through Bandipur even at night. He said that it amounts to violation of the Karnataka High Court ban on the movement of vehicles on the said stretch between 9 pm and 6 am. “People should take up such issues and make a complaint to the authorities concerned,” he said. Singh suggested installation of CCTV cameras for tracking movement of vehicles.

Prajavani Editor K N Shantha Kumar said that media played a vital role in spreading the message of conservation and more efforts need to be made in creating awareness. 

Also present on the occasion was P Anu Chengappa, the advocate who fought for ban on movement of vehicles through Bandipur Tiger Reserve during night time.
