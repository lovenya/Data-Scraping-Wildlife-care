Engineers rushed to repair the damage, filling and repaving a washed-out stretch of roadway here and building a bridge over a newly formed inlet a few miles to the north. The road reopened in October.

But the winds and waves that shape the coast were already gnawing at the new bridge. By January, engineers were reinforcing its southern approach with sandbags and rock trucked in from the mainland in hopes of keeping the road open until a more permanent fix could be designed and built. The Outer Banks are home to some of the US’ most celebrated beach communities. The road that links them offers an extreme example of the difficulty of maintaining houses, condos, roads and other infrastructure in the face of a climate-driven rise in sea level. 

Ocean coastline affected

By some estimates, at least 70 per cent of the ocean coastline of the lower 48 states is threatened by erosion. In 2009, a federal report on erosion in the Middle Atlantic states predicted that if the sea level rises two feet this century – an estimate that many experts call optimistic – “it is likely that some barrier islands in this region will cross a threshold” and begin to break up.

The report, produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Geological Survey and other agencies, said the Outer Banks were particularly threatened. Already, Highway 12 floods repeatedly and is often cut by storms. Maintaining it “is totally a lost cause,” said Stanley R Riggs, a coastal scientist at East Carolina University who is an author of a new book, “The Battle for North Carolina’s Coast,” which describes in depressing detail the difficulties of keeping the road open.

Irene’s attack on Highway 12 came as North Carolina was already confronting a number of issues relating to the fate of the Outer Banks. There was an “advanced deterioration” of the Herbert C Bonner Bridge, which carries the highway from Nags Head to the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge, on the north end of Hatteras Island. Some geologists suggested replacing the bridge with a system of ferries from the mainland. Others suggested maintaining a road link with a causeway or “long bridge,” looping into Pamlico Sound, an idea that the federal Fish and Wildlife Service endorsed as the best long-term option. 

Robert S Young, a coastal geologist who is head of the ‘Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines’ at Western Carolina University, calls the project “our own little bridge to nowhere.” “They can engineer that bridge so well that it can withstand a Category 3 or 4 hurricane,” Young said. 

North Carolina has long been a leader in coastal protection through its ban on coastal armour – like seawalls and revetments – which, while it may protect a particular house or condo, almost inevitably degrades or even destroys sandy beaches. Young is among the coastal scientists who have been recruited to help assess beach damage caused by the groins, a prospect he said was “just so depressing.”Efforts continue to maintain beaches by dredging up sand and pumping it onshore, a chronic activity on the Banks and elsewhere on the coast. When Irene struck, a project was under way in Nags Head, where houses routinely end up in the surf when a storm passes. As expected, Irene washed some of the new sand away. Barrier islands like the Outer Banks are inherently unstable. Waves typically strike these islands at a slight angle, creating currents that pick up sand and carry it along the coast. The wave energy along the Outer Banks is unusually strong; by some estimates 700,000 cubic yards of sand, enough to fill 70,000 average-size dump trucks, moves along that stretch of coast every year. 

Man vs nature

In nature, barrier islands respond to rising seas by gradually moving inland. They erode on the ocean side but expand on the bay side, as storms wash sand across them or as inlets form and the current carries sand toward the bay. Since the middle of the 20th century, though, people here have done a lot to thwart this process. During the Depression, an artificial dune was built that survives today along much of the length of the Banks, blocking the overwash of sand. 

When the islands do wash over, leaving Highway 12 covered in sand, people bulldoze the sand back to the beach. When inlets form, they are filled. The results have been predictable: Eroding on the ocean side and unable to move inland, Hatteras Island has narrowed. “Every year and every storm, the vulnerability just increases,” Young said. Andrew S Coburn, associate director of the shoreline programme at Western Carolina University, noted that Irene was barely hurricane strength when it struck the Banks. 

“It was a pretty weak storm, but that’s not discussed,” he said. 

NC-20, an organisation of government bodies and business people from 20 waterfront counties, acknowledges that sea level has risen about seven inches in the past 100 years but rejects the idea that the situation is worsening. In 2010, however, a panel of experts convened by the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission concluded that a sea level rise of about three feet is likely and should be “adopted as the amount of anticipated rise by 2100, for policy development and planning purposes.”
