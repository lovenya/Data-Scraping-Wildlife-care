The first day of ‘Jewels of the Wild’, a photography exhibition-cum-sale at the Chitrakala Parishat proved that wildlife photography has grown from passion to profession.


ADVERTISEMENTThe event, organised by the Indian Wildlife Rescue Trust (IWRT), was inaugurated by noted photographers T N Perumal and Sudhir Shivaram, and Surendra Verma, scientist from the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation, on Sunday.

Speaking on the occasion, IWRT Founder-Trustee Valish Vasuki said they had organised a common competition for wildlife photographers and the public as well. The idea behind the event was to involve the public in wildlife conservation. 


“Though there were no sales of wildlife photographs on the first day, we aim to sell as many frames as possible to use the money for wildlife conservation, rescue and rehabilitation through the Trust,” he said.

As many as 64 frames by 30 noted Indian photographers are on display at the exhibition. Among them, three best photographs were chosen and awarded on the first day of the three-day event.

Blooming wild flowers in the Himalayas by Manju Mohan bagged the first place in the ‘Nature’ category. A fight between two peacocks captured by Ramu Mastaiah bagged the first place in the ‘Birds’ category and in the ‘Mammals’ category, a wild dog with kill captured by Ramakanth, bagged the first place. Photographs captured by wildlife enthusiast and noted photographer, the late E Hanumantha Rao, between 1940 and 50s are also on display, as part of the event. Wildlife photographers Sathyanarayan C R, K S Manju Mohan, among others, were present on the occasion.
