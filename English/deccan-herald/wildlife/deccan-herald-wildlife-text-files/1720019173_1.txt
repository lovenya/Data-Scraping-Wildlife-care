Colourful handmade puppets adorned with rich jewellery can easily get you engrossed in an epic performance of dance and classical music. 

However, bombe aata, a puppet art form of Yakshagana, is on the brink of extinction with only a few artistes continuing with the tradition of folk art. Although many enjoy watching the performances, learning the art has become a challenge with not many training centres. ADVERTISEMENTFor K V Ramesh who has been a puppeteer since 1981 in Kasargod, bombe aata means more than just entertainment with stories of Mahabharatha and Ramayana infused in it. Although he set out to give Yakshagana a new twist by making wooden puppets on six strings, the roots of the dance are very important to him as it has been nurtured in his family for ten generations. He says, “I have been a puppeteer for 30 years and Yakshagana has been passed on to me by my family. You cannot perform bombe aata without learning Yakshagana.”

The puppeteer never thought that bombe aata would lose its importance over the years. Ramesh says, “Nobody wants to make it a career because of very little or no income at all.” The multi-award winner and his team have performed in countries like Paris, Prague, Dubai and Pakistan that hold annual puppetry shows. “I have brought it to the notice of the State government about its extinction and cultural value. This art form can only be preserved by passing it on to those who want to learn. My team is working on preserving the art form by teaching school children,” says Ramesh, who makes the puppets himself. 

He feels that children are most attracted to puppets and they find the art form fascinating.

A charming town by the Kali

Dandeli in Uttara Kannada district is situated at about 473 meters (1551 ft) and has a cosmopolitan population. There is much to see in and around Dandeli including wildlife, adventure sports and eco-tourism. Old Dandeli town has ancient buildings and a temple dedicated to Dandelappa, a loyal servant of the Mirashi landlords. The town is said to be named after him. Another version is that the town was so named after King Dandakanayaka who passed through it. The River Kali is the main attraction of the town.

 It is fascinating to watch the river in full flow under the road bridge and through clusters of islands with greenery. The town is home to a paper factory because of the availability of forest produce like bamboo and river. There are two hydroelectric power stations near by utilising the waters of River Kali, one at Ambikanagar and the other at Ganeshgudi. Dandeli is the gateway to the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary, Anshi National Park and Kulgi Nature camp. Dandeli can be reached by road from Dharwad or Sirsi via Yellapur. 

The nearest railhead is at Dharwad. The sanctuary is about 12 km from Dandeli. Dandeli has a few lodges for the convenience of tourists.
