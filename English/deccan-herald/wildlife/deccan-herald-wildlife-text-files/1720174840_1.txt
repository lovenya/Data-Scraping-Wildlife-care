He was digging the earth for tubers in the forest near Sebinakolli hamlet on Thursday evening when the tiger pounced on him. Kencha died instantly. The tiger also tried to attack a boy, Ballu, who was with Kencha. However, Ballu climbed a tree and escaped. He said he tried to chase the tiger away by throwing a rod.Accusing the Forest department of failing to trap the tiger, angry villagers staged a protest, blocking the Mysuru-Mananthavadi road. Principal Chief Conservator (Wildlife) Jayaram said the Forest department will take appropriate action after consulting officials and experts. Jayaram told DH from Thimmanahosahalli that he visited the spot and has spoken to officials.Earlier, a high-level officers’ meeting was held in Bengaluru on Thursday evening. K M Narayanaswamy, director, Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, told DH that Jayaram will visit Mysuru district to inspect the spot. “A decision on the next course of action will be taken on Friday morning,” he said.Villagers say one Nanjunda who had been to attend a nature’s call at Machuri village escaped narrowly from the tiger attack on Thursday morning. One Madhu was killed by the wild cat at Manimole tribal hamlet on December 24, 2018. Chinnappa of Gundumetlu village was mauled to death by a tiger on January 28.Officials who launched a search for the tiger after Chinnappa’s death, had to return as camp elephants Arjuna and Abhimanyu were allegedly in masth (a condition marked by aggressive behaviour). Officials received information of a tiger sighting near the Ashram School at Anemala but were unable to investigate due to the elephants’ masth.
