Ask her about her favourite holiday destination and she says, “My favourite holiday destinations are the places I have never been to and am planning to visit. Amongst those are New Zealand, Egypt and Chile.”

New Zealand for instance is now extremely popular amongst tourists and adventure junkies alike. The country’s beautiful landscapes, lush forests, amazing wildlife and pleasant climate make it a haven for many outdoor activities, and a great place to unwind. Egypt on the other hand is well-known for its rich culture and history while tourism in Chile has been growing by leaps and bounds recently. The country is blessed with natural beauty including natural landscapes, the Atacama Desert to Patagonia, the Andes of the Central Valley and the old-growth forests of the Lakes District. Chile is home to 32 national parks, 48 natural reserves and 15 natural monuments. Reason enough why millions visit the country every year.
