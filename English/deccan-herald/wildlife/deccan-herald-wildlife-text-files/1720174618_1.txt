Officials, who searched the area in Nyahururu district for Martha Nduta, found only a human skull and a few scraps of bone last Friday, The Sun reported Tuesday.

Relatives identified the 58-year-old's body from the remains of her ripped clothes and a shoe found at the scene.

Francio Nyamatari, Laikipia West police chief, said Kenya Wildlife Service rangers will hunt down the male lion as panic-stricken villagers fear it may strike again.

It is believed the rogue animal escaped through a broken fence at the private Laikipia Nature Conservancy before entering a nearby village, about 177 km north of Nairobi, where it killed the woman.ADVERTISEMENT
