The High Court on Friday questioned the State government as to how a resort was allowed to be built inside the Bhadra protected forest. 

ADVERTISEMENTHearing a suo motu PIL on a report published in Deccan Herald about Satish Gowda D S, a wildlife warden who constructed a resort inside the protected forest in Chikkamagaluru district, a division bench comprising Chief Justice D H Waghela and Justice Ram Mohan Reddy lambasted the government. The bench asked when and how an area in the middle of a protected forest became private land. 

How the wildlife warden was allowed to buy the land and who granted permission for the same, were some of the questions raised. The government counsel responded that the resort was constructed on revenue land. To this, the bench demanded who granted the permission to construct the road leading to the resort. 

FIR by Forest dept 

The petition was about the FIR filed by the Forest department against Gowda, an honorary wildlife warden of the Bhadra Protected Forest who illegally constructed a resort for Rs two crore in flagrant violation of the forest and wildlife Acts. Gowda owns seven acres of land in survey No 216 in Sirivase village, which is adjacent to the Bhadra and Masagali protected forests. 

The report says that Gowda has been constructing a huge building on three fourths of an acre—situated between Bhadra Protected Forest and Masagali Reserve Forest—without obtaining permission or a no-objection certificate from the Forest department or the district administration.

Gowda did not obtain permission for change in land use (land conversion), but secured a building licence from the gram panchayat for constructing a farmhouse on the agricultural land. 

The bench directed the government to submit all documents pertaining to the said resort including photographs, maps and khatas in the next hearing on June 5.
