The jungles of Savanadurga, now a wildlife sanctuary, has been home for millennia to forest dwelling communities such as Iruliga, Soliga, Shillekyatha, Kadugolla and others. Amid the thickly wooded hills of the forest, the communities have been living as they have done for centuries, retaining their traditions and culture. 

Lack of political clout has meant complete lack of amenities for these communities.
Jodugatte, a hamlet of Iruligas is located on the road from Magadi to Ramanagara. In the foothills of Jenugudda is the Iruliga colony comprising 55 huts. A tubewell sunk years ago does not yield water anymore as the pump has not been working as long as one can remember. 

There are no toilets in the colony, and the families are too scared to use the land outside their colony for defecation for fear of rousing the wrath of owners of land adjacent to the colony.

Women have it the worst, and have to relieve themselves either before dawn or after dusk.

“We live in fear, insecurity and utter poverty. Now that Indiramma (Indira Gandhi) is dead, there is none to bother about us,” says Muniyamma, now in her seventies, wiping tears off her leathery face.

The colony has been allocated a residential school, but till now, it remains a mirage. The Social Welfare Department officers dismiss pleas of parents with the excuse that there is no land to locate the school.

“Can’t blame anyone. We are cursed,”says an Iruliga elder. That lack of hope is born out of defeated efforts to secure their basic rights. When they tried to build houses on a small plot of land in the forest, officers virtually hounded them out, and filed criminal cases against them.

“We, who have protected forests for  thousands of years are now hunted like wild animals. But everyday, huge trees being cut down on the sly and smuggled out. But we are punished if we enter the forest to collect non-timber forest produce, such as dried wood for fuel or fruits. The forest officers have decided to drive us out, so that such activities can continue unhindered,” says an Iruliga.ADVERTISEMENT
