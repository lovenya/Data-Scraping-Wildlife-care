Custom departmentâ€™s sleuths seized a consignment of over 300 kg of pangolin scales on Saturday night, they said.

On June 17, two bags containing ten kg of tiger bones and nearly 200 kg of pangolin scales were seized from the airport, they said, adding two persons have been arrested in this connection.

Both the consignments were meant to be sent to West Imphal via Dimapur.

The value of pangolin scale is estimated to be around Rs 70,000 per kg, while ten gms of tiger bone fetches about $200 in the international market, customs department officials said.

Pangolin, found widely in the forests of North-Eastern region, is targeted for its scales which are prized for its high medicinal value in China and other South East Asian countries.
Forest officials have not ruled out the possibility of poaching in wildlife sanctuaries of the state.
