Green Matrix, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) involved with wildlife, and Samhita Academy have been roped in to spread awareness about the animals and wildlife to a larger spectrum of people.

The adoption drive, scheduled between August 4 and October 4, will see school children participating in different activities, Park authorities said. 

While on the one hand it will help several school students get educated about the habitat, and food habits of animals, it will help the park’s endeavour of creating awareness and generating people to adopt animals in the park.

Speaking to Deccan Herald Bannerghatta Biological Park Executive Director Millo Tago said: “The adoption drive has been happening for several years now. This time we thought we’ll extend it to people beyond the regular group as also spread awareness to a larger group of people. Therefore, we’ve roped in  the two organisations and hope it will help meeting our objective.”

The programme will see over 70 school children from schools including Samhita Academy participating in the event, wherein they and the general public can adopt an animal in the Park for a day, a week, a month or years.

The name of the person adopting the animal would be put up for public view. Also there would be a painting competition for school children with the theme –– wildlife conservation –– and they will also be taken on a safari ride.

Samhita Academy Principal  Kamakshi Jayaram said that this is just an extension of the several initiatives that the school has for the year in relation to wildlife and nature.
She said that this will not be a one time affair for the school. The children will take up projects of educating the villages around Bannerghatta, and the public in general. “The impact is larger when children educate adults over issues that need immediate attention.”
