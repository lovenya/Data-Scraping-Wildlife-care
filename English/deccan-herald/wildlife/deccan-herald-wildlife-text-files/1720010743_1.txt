The restrictions on the sale of land or property in Gudalur, Pandalur and Udaghamandalam revenue divisions in the district have hit the common people most “who have complained” of being unable to sell their land or property as a consequence, she said. 

On the one hand, Jayalalitha alleged in a statement here that the ruling DMK was taking steps to “evict” people from lands adjoining the Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary, asking them to shift their houses saying the present government has declared it a tiger reserve area.  

On the other, people in urgent need to sell their property/land had to contend with unreasonable restrictions under the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forests Act, she said, adding it was a violation of human rights.   

To protest against the issue, Semmalai, the AIADMK MP from Salem,  will lead a demonstration before the Gudalur Revenue Divisional Office on November 9.ADVERTISEMENT
