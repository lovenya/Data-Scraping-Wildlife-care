Wildlife, Environment and Fisheries Minister J Krishna Palemar told reporters in Kolar on Wednesday that the scheme was planned to check littering of garbage on the roadsides.
A toll-free number will be launched to facilitate the public to inform when they spot a vehicle disposing garbage on the roadside or in public places, he said.  

“The onus of waste management is on the local administration authorities. But, they have not been able to check the trend. Action will be taken against the local administrations too for their failure,” the minister said. 

Lake development

A new pilot project will be taken up in association with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, to ensure pollution-free lakes across the State, beginning with the 120-acre Agaram lake in Bangalore, he said. 

Besides, the Government will soon identify a village to implement its pilot project  ‘pollution-free village’, he added.

A sum of Rs 254 crore is expected to be mobilised through the environment cess on those using private land for mining and other purposes. Already, Rs 50 crore has been collected, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
