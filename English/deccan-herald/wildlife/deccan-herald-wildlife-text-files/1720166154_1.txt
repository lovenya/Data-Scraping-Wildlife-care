Two Indian star Tortoises of a protected species were found abandoned in an east Delhi park, following which they were rescued by a wildlife NGO.

ADVERTISEMENTA distress call was placed to the 24-hour-rescue helpline of NGO Wildlife SOS by one Sanjeev Gandhi about the tortoises at the Millennium Indraprastha Park on the Outer Ring Road in East Delhi.

“I saw some crows creating a ruckus near a bush and out of curiosity, decided to take a closer look. I was surprised to find two tortoises behind the bush. After taking the Wildlife SOS helpline number from a friend, I contacted their helpline for assistance,” said Sanjeev Gandhi.

Responding to the call, the Wildlife SOS’ Rapid Response Unit reached the spot and identified them as Indian star tortoises (Geochelone elegans), a species found in India, South-eastern Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

This species is quite popular in the exotic pet trade despite being protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. They are also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), which regulates the international trade of wildlife species.

“We believe that the tortoises were abandoned in the park. This species is often kept as ‘exotic’ pets or for spiritual purposes. In India, it is illegal to possess and commercially trade protected tortoise species. A large number of specimens of the Indian star tortoise are found in the illegal wildlife pet trade due to their high demand in the international black market,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder of Wildlife SOS.

The reptiles are currently under the care of the organisation, which is one of the largest rescue and conversation charities in South Asia.
