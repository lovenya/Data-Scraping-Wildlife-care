In the wake of this, the plastic had already been banned from February 2011. 

The devotees have been asked not to carry plastic items to the hills and the department had put boards in this regard. The checking at the entry point has been tightened. The peopleâ€™s cooperation was equally important for the implementation of such an order.

He said despite the orders, still the plastic items were strewn in the temple premises and surrounding places. Last week, a team of officials led by Deputy Commissioner K Amaranarayan undertook a massive cleanliness drive in the whole area. The DC also held discussion with the temple priests and has taken some steps. Accordingly, no shop will be allowed to be put in the surroundings of Gopalaswamy Hills. The offering to be brought by devotees in plastic bags would be transferred to clothe bags to be made available at the check points at very reasonable price. The devotees should voluntarily handover the plastic bags to the personnel at the check points and carry the items only in clothe bags.

Hosmath said the tahsildhar of Gundlupet taluk has promised to make drinking water arrangement atop the hills. In the wake of this, the devotees have to show the bottled water at the check point and then take them. Even food items packed in plastic would not be allowed atop the hills. All these measures were aimed to protecting flora and fauna in the region, he noted.
