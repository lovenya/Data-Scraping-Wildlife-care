Asha had purchased 3.32 acres of land (survey 497/1 ofBachalli village), which was converted for personal residential purpose vide order ALN/CR/146/2007-08 dated September 17, 2009. However, a resort cropped up there in violation of condition number two of the Government Order, which states the land was to be used only for residential purpose.

The Government Order, in condition number nine, also mentions that if any condition of the Order was violated, illegal buildings would be demolished. The cost for the work would be borne by land owners, according to Section 96 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964.

Interestingly, the owner of the resort had filed an affidavit on September 19, 2009, with the DC stating that in case of a violation, the government was free to demolish illegal buildings on the land.

The Chamarajnagar DC, based on a letter dated August 22, 2011, by the Deputy Conservator of Forests of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (AL/BVD/ECO-SENSITIVEZONE/aaka/2010-11), withdrew the land conversion order on August 26, 2011.

However, even six months after the land conversion was cancelled by the DC, the illegal buildings (nearly 30 cottages and other buildings) of the resort have not been demolished and it is business as usual there. “The word ‘residency’ has been added to show that the land is used for residential purposes and hoodwink the law,” said sources.

According to visitors, the resort is marketed on the website http://www.jungleresortbandipur.com, and any guest who calls up the resort for booking is asked to deposit money in account number 012107300000097 of South India Bank, Coonoor, Tamil Nadu, at Rs 3,000/person/ night.

The resort, according to wildlife experts, falls in a crucial elephant and other large mammal corridor between Bandipur and Mudumalai Tiger Reserves and obstructs the movement of wildlife. The area has recently been declared an eco-sensitive zone and it is illegal to run a resort here, according to the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

“To make matters worse, there is a waterhole right next to the resort, and animals do not have any other water source for several kilometres. The resort blocks wild animals from using water,” said an expert, on condition of anonymity.
