A lone tusker, which had trampled a man to death and had destroyed crops, worth lakhs of rupees, was successfully captured by a team of Forest department personnel, here, on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe rogue elephant was giving sleepless nights to the people in Dinnalli, Kothuguli, Hoogyam and Minyam villages for past several days. It had attacked a farmer, who was guarding the crops, and had killed him. The jumbo had also destroyed standing crops, causing heavy loss to farmers.
