KPCL MD S M Jaamdar said that each of the hydel plants are set in a scenic location, but they had never considered using it for tourism earlier. 

“We will divide the area in two zones. Prohibited and permitted area. The power plant will be in the prohibited area and no one will be allowed access into this place,” he said. The permitted area will be used for tourism and related activities. In places like Doddamakali, there is no power plant, but a large tract of land that has remained unused. With six dams in Western ghats, KPCL is set to maximise the use of these plants, which are being increasingly seen as ideal tourist destinations.

PPP model

Sources in KPCL said that the tourist venture would be developed through Public Private Partnership (PPP) and talks are on with Mahindra and Mahindra, Jungle Lodges and Orange County for chalking out the details. No decision is said to be made on sharing of revenue yet, although these details are likely to be finalised shortly. Activities like water sports, boating and building of accommodation will figure in the plans for developing these places.

Security reasons

The Shimsha area which has dense forests and rich flora will also have a museum. Jaamdar said they are not considering smaller players because of the  security threats to all the power plants. Shivanasamudra was closed to tourists in 1993 due to threats from LTTE. The 100-year -old power station was reopened in 2004, but closed down almost immediately due to continuing security concerns. Even with the opening of areas in the vicinity of power plants for tourism, the plants will continue to be strictly off limits to the public.

Some of the areas opening up to tourism are Kadra, Supa and Nagjhari around Kali; Agumbe ghats, Vanake-Abbey falls, Kudlu Theertha falls around river Varahi and Sharavati Wildlife sanctuary, Someshwara Wildlife sanctuary and Kodchadri around river Sharavati.
