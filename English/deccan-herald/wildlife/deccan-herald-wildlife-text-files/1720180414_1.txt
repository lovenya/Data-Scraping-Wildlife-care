After a wait of six months, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has finally got a chairman.ADVERTISEMENTThe state government on Tuesday appointed C Jayaram, retired principal chief conservator of forests, wildlife, to the post. He has been directed to take charge with immediate effect on March 6.“I will have a meeting and understand things. I also have Manoj Kumar as member secretary,” said Jayaram, who retired from the post of principal chief conservator of forests on February 28.The state government had faced severe criticism from all quarters on the increasing pollution in city lakes.The government had also faced flak over the credentials of the chairman to be appointed.Following this, it had set some rules for the selection process — like someone with sound environmental knowledge, no inclination to any realtor, builder or company and no political connection.That was the reason why many MLAs were not given the plum post, said an official.
