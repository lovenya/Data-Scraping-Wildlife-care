It is said quarrying is being undertaken for the past two years, but it was stopped for a while. However, it resumed a month ago. 

The Forest Department has lodged a complaint against illegal quarrying with the police.  The Bandipur-Nagarahole National Parks are home to deer, gaurs and sambars. 

Black bucks are spotted very rarely here. Omkara Wildlife Division is among a very few places in south Karnataka where the endangered species is found. Besides, Omkara Wildlife Division is also categorised as an elephant corridor. 

It is said at least 12 black bucks were identified earlier, now there are only nine. Black bucks, which are generally very sensitive and shy, are finding it difficult due to the explosives used in quarrying and are moving towards villages located on the fringes, thus becoming easy targets for poachers. 

What the law says 
According to Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, a 10-km area around national parks and reserved forests can be declared ecologically-sensitive. Since Bandipur National Park is declared ecologically sensitive, mining is totally banned there. 

A directive issued by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (March 15, 2011) has made it mandatory to seek permission from the National Wildlife Advisory Board to take up projects within a 10-km radius of national parks and reserved forests. But the Revenue and Mining departments seem to have ignored the order in this case.

When Nanjangud Tahsildar, Navin Joseph, was contacted, he said: “The area does not come under Nanjangud, but belongs to Gundlupet taluk”.  But Gundlupet Tahsildar, G N Manjunath, says the mining area is in Nanjangud taluk. While the officers are in denial mode, it is a mystery as to who issued permits for illegal quarrying in the forest area.
