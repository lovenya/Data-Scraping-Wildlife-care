Greg Heffley considers middle school to be the dumbest idea ever invented. To survive the never-endering ordeal of middle school, Greg devises an endless series of schemes, all of which don’t go to plan. He puts it all down in his diary, or a journal as he terms it, filling it with his thoughts, stories and tales of trials and tribulations of his everyday life. “One day when I’m famous,” writes Greg, “I’ll have better things to do than answer people’s stupid questions all day!”
