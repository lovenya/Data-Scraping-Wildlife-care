The scheme – Adopt an Animal – aims at connecting the common man with wildlife and generating awareness on the proper upkeep of animals and birds at the Patna zoo.

“We want the common man’s involvement in wildlife conservation. Hence we have submitted a proposal to the state government which would entitle any individual, organisation or a corporate group to adopt an animal, a group of animals or the entire zoo,” said Abhay Kumar, director of the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park.

The proposal, which is likely to be cleared by September, will not only help generate revenue but allow people to join the elite club of celebrities who have adopted animals at different zoos.

While actress Priyanka Chopra has adopted a white tigress at Birsa Munda zoo in Ranchi, Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan have adopted a giraffe and a tiger respectively. Recently, Dhoni adopted a Royal Bengal Tiger — Agasthya —at Mysore zoo where he donated Rs 1 lakh as the annual sponsorship fee.

As per the proposal sent here, an elephant can be adopted for a month for a sponsorship fee of Rs 35,000, while  for a giraffe it would be Rs 25,000. For a tiger or a lion, the sponsorship fee is Rs 15,000, while for rhino its Rs 18,000. A leopard or a zebra could be sponsored for Rs 6,000, but for a bear it would cost you Rs 12,000.
“All payments related to animal adoption will be exempted from tax under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act,” said the zoo director. 

“However, the adoption will not give the person any right to handle, play or touch the animals inside the enclosure, or change their dietary habits,” he added.

Under the proposed scheme, a signboard with the company’s logo or the name of the person adopting the animal will be displayed outside the enclosure.The person (or the company) can expect incentives like certificates, gifts, special invitations, free entry passes to children’s park or a ride on the toy train.

 “For special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries, one can adopt the entire zoo for a day for nominal sum of Rs 25,000,” said the director.
