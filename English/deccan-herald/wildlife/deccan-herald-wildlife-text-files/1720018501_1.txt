M R Anandaram, son of M S Ramaiah, has purchased 25.23 acres of land in Kebbepura village of Hangala Hobli (survey numbers 123, 124, 126, 129/1, 129/2, 143 and 144). 

According to Wildlife Matters Trust (WMT), Anandram has got the land alienated by the deputy commissioner (order no ALNCR 116 24-07-2010) for establishing a nature and ayurveda tourism resort.

Incidentally, Anandram’s son A Jagadeeshram has also bought 28.25 acres of land in Bachally village (survey nos. 475/1, 475/2, 476, 478/1, 501, 510 and 511) for establishing a nature and ayurveda tourism resort called Tropical Wilderness and Wellness Village Private Limited.

Permission to buy the land was given during the Global Investors Meet vide Government Order no. LRF/PR/08/2010-11 dated December 10, 2010.

Both these lands are in critical wildlife corridors that connect Bandipur to Lokkere and Heggavadi forests, which are further connected to Mudhumalai and Satyamangalam sanctuaries in Tamilnadu, and the opinion of the Forest Department has not been sought in both cases.

Multiple resorts

The Forest Department had booked a forest offence case against A Jagadeeshram on October 10, 2010, for illegally clearing forests on this land (FOC no 50/10-11) and seized about two tonnes of trees that grow in the wild. In spite of this, the Revenue Department has still given them permission to establish multiple resorts in the same area.

The Forest Department has now taken a serious note of these violations and has written to Revenue Department saying no land should be alienated for constructing tourism resorts in the critical wildlife corridor around Bandipur (in Mangala, Kaniyanpura, Kebbepura, Yelchetti, Bachalli, Heggavadi and other surrounding villages which contain natural forests).

“According to a Supreme Court order in writ petition numbers 202/1996, these villages around Bandipur tiger reserve have natural forests, described as ‘deemed forests’ and cannot be cut without the permission of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. But the Revenue Department continues to alienate land in violation of the Supreme Court’s order,“ members of the WMT alleged.

Incidentally, the principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden had written to principal secretary on April 2, 2011, seeking a transfer of 42.73 sq km area of land spread across six reserve forests in Chamrajanagar district to the Forest Department from Revenue Department. However, no action has been taken so far.

Guruprasad Thimmapur, a representative of WMT, points out that if these two resorts came up they would permanently cut off the critical elephant corridor in this area. “If the State Government is serious about reducing human-elephant conflict and loss of human lives, it has to prevent the Revenue Department from permitting the construction of resorts in this area, “ he said.ADVERTISEMENT
