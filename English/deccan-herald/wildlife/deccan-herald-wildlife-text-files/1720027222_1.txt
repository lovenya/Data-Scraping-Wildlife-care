The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and the Chief Wildlife Warden have issued no-objection certificate (NoC)) to bring two female elephants to the City from Trichy, Tamil Nadu, for 45 days to participate in the religious ceremonies at different Ayyappa temples. 

However, it is alleged that the permission and the 45-day duration granted by the PCCF was in violation of the law. The NOC was issued to N Shekhar, the owner of the two elephants, Rani and Suma, which are being hired to temples in the City for a price. ADVERTISEMENTPriest of a Ayyappa temple told Deccan Herald that he had booked one of the elephants to participate in the pooja and procession on January 4 for Rs 20,000 per day.
  
The Wildlife (Protection) Act categorises Indian elephants as Schedule I animals in terms of degree of protection. They are not to be used for commercial purposes. Section 43 of the Act says transfer by way of sale or offer for sale or by any other mode of consideration of commercial nature is not permitted.  

The elephants have a fixed booking from December 2 till January 14 and will visit 14 temples. A complaint by Sharath Babu R, Wildlife Warden, Bangalore Urban, to the PCCF said the elephants were on a whirlwind tour being rented for Rs 25,000 per hour.

 He also said: “People were busy buying elephant tail hair from the mahouts.” Following the complaint, a range forest officer was asked to conduct an inspection. He submitted a report that the facilities for the animals were fine.

Appu Rao, deputy conservator of forest, Bangalore Urban, said: “It is PCCF’s discretion to issue NoC to bring elephants for religious purposes. However, 45 days is a long period and is definitely a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act.”
