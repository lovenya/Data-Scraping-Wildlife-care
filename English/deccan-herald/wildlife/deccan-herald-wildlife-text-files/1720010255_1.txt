The state government two days ago called for expressions of interest from national and international landscape consultants and architects for developing a concept plan for “Smruthi Vanam” or memorial in Vegodu reserve forest at Srisailam, which is a part of the Nagarjunasagar tiger reserve.

Opposition

Amidst opposition from environmentalists who claim that the project spread over 1,140 sq km would cause destruction to valuable wildlife in the region, the National Tiger Conservation Authority had asked the Andhra Pradesh government to submit the details of proposed memorial.

A memorial stupa, a trekking path to the accident site, breeding centres, nature interpretation centre besides a peacock park is proposed at the Rs 3.5 crore YSR Memorial Park, to be ready by next September.

The report was sought after non-official members of the National Board for Wildlife such as Brijendra Singh, Valmik Thapar and Asad Rahmani wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying that the construction of “Smruti Vanam” was in violation of the Wildlife and Forest Act as the habitat has flora and fauna.

However, rejecting the allegations, the state officials have contended that “Smruthi Vanam” will not only contribute to the conservation of the area but also convey the conservation message to the public through interpretive signages and guiding system.
