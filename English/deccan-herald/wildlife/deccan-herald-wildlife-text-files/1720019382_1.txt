Talking to reporters after a meeting with senior forest department officials here, he said the forest department became handicapped due to dearth of forest personnel in lower cadres like watchers, guards and foresters. ADVERTISEMENT“There is a big difference between the staff and the forest cover area in state. The disproportionate ratio between the two has led to many problems – looting, poaching and wildlife menace. The existing guards and watchers are also ageing. We need to recruit thousands of youth to deal with these woes. A proposal will soon be prepared for it,” the minister said.He said a special force will be established in Mysore to deal with wild jumbo menace in villages surrounding forest fringes in state. 

The force will be prepared to act and bring to control the wild animals like elephants anytime and anywhere. Farmers can seek help if elephants strays into their village or farm field. The special force would act swiftly to provide them a relief,” he said.
