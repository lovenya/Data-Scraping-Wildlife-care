A photography exhibition that will help people suffering from multiple sclerosis is being held at Chitrakala Parishath in the city. 

‘Thank God it’s Saturday’ (TGiS), a city-based photography group, has displayed the photographs shot by its members at its fifth exhibition this year. 

The six-day exhibition began on June 1. All the proceeds from the exhibition will be donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of India (MSSI). Themed around ‘JagaChitra,’ which means wonder of the universe, the exhibition has a collection of about 110 pictures, shortlisted from 500 submissions. 

In keeping with the theme, TGiS members shot photographs from around the world, showcasing scenic locales, culture, wildlife, nature and people. Apart from India, the images are from Bruges, the Swiss Alps, Arizona, Krabi Islands, London, Cambodia, Angkor Wat etc. 

The TGiS comprises members who have attended photography workshops headed by celebrated photographer Anand Sharan.

TGiS has been associated with MSSI. Last year, it generated Rs 7 lakh from the sale of 100 frames and the proceeds were donated to MSSI. 

Multiple sclerosis is often a disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. 

The donation last year helped in treating many patients from below the poverty line.
