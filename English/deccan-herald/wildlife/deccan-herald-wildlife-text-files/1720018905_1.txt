A meeting with officials of the department too has been scheduled for Monday to chalk out the translocation plan.

However, according to sources in the MoEF, the ministry is opposed to the idea of shifting all the 25 elephants at one go. A senior official said the recent Mysore incident where two elephants ran amuck in the heritage city killing one person, had made the ministry “very nervous.” The failure of translocation experiment of two elephants from Alur to the Bandipur range too put the ministry in a spot. 

In view of not so encouraging precedents, the MoEF has asked the Forest department to shift the elephants in a phased manner. In the event of any pachyderm returning to its original habitat, the ministry would direct the department to drop the exercise. Sources told Deccan Herald that no permission had been granted for translocation and the State Government is required to revise its proposal on the concerns expressed by the MoEF.

Expensive task

Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Dr Swaminath N H said capturing elephants is an expensive and time-consuming task. The department spent over Rs eight lakh to capture and shift an elephant from Savandurga and the process took about 10 days.

The exercise of capturing an elephant costs anywhere between Rs three to five lakh. In other words, the proposed plan entails an expenditure of anywhere between Rs 75 lakh to Rs one crore.

Field Director, Project Elephant, Karnataka, Ajay Mishra said this time around the authorities were hoping that the shifting exercise would be a success.

“Yes, the previous experiment was a failure. However, this time we are hoping that things will be different. As the entire herd will be shifted, the elephants will not miss members of their herd and stray back into Alur. Moreover, the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, about 260 km from Alur, has around 500 elephants, which are not used to cross into the Hassan forest range. Hopefully the elephants from Alur will also get used to the routes and home ranges of the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary elephants,” he said. Mishra also said that the department’s other option of taming the elephants and setting up a camp for them, would only come as a last resort.

Officials also said in case of stiff opposition to relocation, the elephants may be tamed and sent to Madhya Pradesh. Yogeeshwara had said that the Madhya Pradesh and Odisha governments have sought 10  jumbos each and the request would be honoured in the interest of promoting tourism.ADVERTISEMENT
