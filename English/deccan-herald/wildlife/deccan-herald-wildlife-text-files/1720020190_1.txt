Many such ditches have been dug in Yedthore area to prevent the elephants from barging into coffee estates. It is said that the female elephant which died in the incident, had come to the area in search of food. While crossing the ditch it fell into the ditch. As the elephant fell on its head, it got suffocated and died, say the forest sources.

Mud thrown inside the narrow ditch suggests that the elephant had fiercely tried to rescue itself from the ditch.

Deputy Conservator of Forest Vijay Ranjan Singh, Assistant Conservator of Forest Bellyappa among others inspected the spot. 

The corpse of the jumbo was lifted using a crane. Dr Umashankar from the wildlife Division conducted the post mortem and then the corpse was burnt.
