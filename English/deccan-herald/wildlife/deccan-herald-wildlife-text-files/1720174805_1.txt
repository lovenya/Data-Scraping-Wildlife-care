Gajapayana, the march of elephants to the city from the jungle camps to participate in Dasara, has been postponed in the wake of natural calamity in Kodagu district. The Gajapayana was scheduled for August 23.ADVERTISEMENTDeputy Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Sidramappa Chalkapure said, Gajapayana, the first leg of Dasara festival, had been postponed and the next date would be announced soon. Dasara 2018 commences on October 10 and the Jamboo Savari will be held on October 19, on Vijayadashami Day.The Gajapayana commences at Veeranahosahalli near Nagapura hamlet on the outskirts of Nagarahole National Park, Hunsur taluk, Mysuru district.Following the natural disaster in Kodagu, Mysuru Dasara is likely to be a low-key affair this year. However, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has to take a call in this regard.It may be mentioned that the chief minister, during the preliminary meeting of the high-power committee on July 11, had asked the authorities concerned to make all arrangements to celebrate Dasara-2018 in a grand manner as the state received good rainfall.The district administration too had held several meetings and planned a variety of programmes and events in this regard. There were plans to invite Indian Armed Forces to organise an air show ahead of Dasara to attract more number of tourists.Earlier too, the state had decided for a low-key Dasara due to calamities and other occurrences. The celebration was a simple affair in 2001 and 2002 due to massive earthquake in Gujarat and drought situation in the state, respectively. Dasara-2011 was also celebrated in a simple and significant manner and the ‘Jamboo Savari’ was restricted to the precincts of Mysuru Palace. Similarly, Dasara 2015 was scaled down in view of drought and a spate of farmers’ suicides in the state. Progressive farmer from H D Kote, M Puttaiah, inaugurated Dasara-2015.
