Four lions - Kesari, Dhananjay, Prema and Radha - housed at the zoological park safari have acclimatised well.Deputy Conservator of Forests, Sonal Vrishni, told DH, "The maximum temperature at Gir hovers in the range of 40 to 45 degrees Celsius while it is 38 to 42 degrees in Bilikal reserve forest. Hillocks dotted with bushes here are perfect for lions. The area is just tailor-made for breeding of the endangered species. Hence, we are planning to start a breeding centre for captive lions."In a first for North Karnataka, the zoological park will soon get a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre. The works for the centre are underway and are expected to get over in a month or two, she informed."There are several zoos/zoological parks in north Karnataka.
