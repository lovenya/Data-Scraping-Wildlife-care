Fire lines will be created across the national highways passing through Tiger Reserve, main roads, safari route, and viewpoints. Bandipur Range Forest Officer Srinivas said, “With summer around the corner, the bushes and grass have started drying. A small spark may turn into a wildfire. Hence, the dry grass and bushes on the roadsides are being burnt with the help of tribals. The fire lines would be 30 metres wide on the main road, safari road, viewpoint and 10 metres on the sides of the walking path. The fire lines cover around 2,500 km.” Tribals were engaged for getting the weeds, lantana bushes and dried grass removed from both sides of the roads. Each group comprised 25 members. Awareness is being created among the vehicle drivers against smoking. Patrolling will also be intensified in the area, Srinivas said.
