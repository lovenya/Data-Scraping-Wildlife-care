Sulvadi Maramma temple in Hanur taluk, where prasadam, laced with pesticides, was distributed among devotees, has a history of over six centuries. The village is 28 km from Hanur town.ADVERTISEMENTThe deity is considered divine among devotees. The village ‘Sulvadi’ (lie) got its name as Maramma lied to Shravana Dore, an evil king of the region, to end his era.The villagers believe that centuries ago, Shravana Dore had occupied the region. Even Maramma, was under his control. Mahadeshwara, who is now considered as god, wanted to kill Shravana for the well-being of the people. Thus, he convinced Maramma to support him.“Shravana Dore had great faith in Maramma as she had divine powers. The demon used to ask her about his good and bad times. Once, Mahadeshwara convinced Maramma to lie to Shravana and killed him. Thus the village got its name ‘Sulvadi’,” explains Mahadesh, a devotee. Later, Mahadeshwara settled in MM Hills, while Maramma stayed in Sulvadi, he adds.Initially, villagers used to worship a stone under a tree as Maramma. Four decades ago, a temple was constructed. Now, the temple is popular among devotees from Tamil Nadu and people from neighbouring villages. The devotees sacrifice sheep to fulfill their vows. For the past three years, the villagers have been organising Jatramahotsava, he said.Maramma temple, located a kilometre away from the village inside the forest, is more popular than the two temples, which are inside the village.Chamarajanagar Police have taken three persons into custody for questioning. Temple trustee Chinnappi, his follower Murugesh, and a priest, have been taken into custody for questioning.Forest department officials said that they have collected samples of 27 crows and one maina bird in the forest region, near the temple.Muttegowda, Assistant Conservator of Forests, Ramapur Range, MM Hill Wildlife Sanctuary, said, “We have sent the samples to the lab and the cause for the death will be established, based on the lab report.”
