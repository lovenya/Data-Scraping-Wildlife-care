The Rajasthan forest department on Tuesday  ordered a probe into alleged violation of Wildlife Protection Act by a noted private school of Jhunjhunu district in the state.

ADVERTISEMENTThe department asked a senior official to look into a complaint made by a Haryana based organisation, working for animal protection, accusing the school management of having specimen of rare reptiles and animals in its possession.

“On receiving the complaint, forest official of Jhunjhunu was directed today to go to the school and look into the matter and recover the illegal specimen, if any,” an official said.

The complainant Naresh Kadyan, chairman of People for Animals, alleged that 
despite a ban the school 
has preserved specimen of endangered animals in display cases in the school’s laboratory.

“CBSE issued guidelines in 2010 for schools for discontinuing use of rare/endangered wild animals dead or alive in laboratories. 

I obtained information through RTI from CBSC that this school has not informed the CBSE about preserving endangered animal specimen but a picture of the same is available on the school’s website in which specimen of rare reptiles, animals are seen,” he said.

“We demand legal action against those found guilty in the matter including the school management, poacher and trader who made available the specimen to the school,” he said.The school authorities could not be contacted for comments.
