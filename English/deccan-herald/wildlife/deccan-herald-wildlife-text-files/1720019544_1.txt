The Rann Utsav will be taking a visitor around the place while introducing him or her to the indigenous and ethnic flavour of the Kutch region. During the Rann Utsav, the Tourism Corporation organises various activities for the tourists like Rann Safari, ‘Kutch Carnival’ and cultural programmes including folk music and dance performances in moonlight, optional tours, visit to a typical Kutch village and adventure sports. 

The Tourism Corporation offers two packages — a three-night-and-four-day package which costs Rs 9,500 per person for AC and Rs 8,000 for non-AC tents and a two-night-three-day package which is priced at Rs 7,000 per person. These packages cover meals, sightseeing, drop facilities etc. 

From December 25 to 31, there will be a ‘Para Gliding Festival’ in Saputara, the only hill station in Gujarat. The main attractions of the festival will be paragliding, paraplane, paramotoring, parasailing, water sports and artificial rock climbing. This year too, the Tourism Corporation is organising an ‘International Kite Festival’ from January 10 to 15 which draws people from all over the world.

To add to the charm of this tourism fest, the ‘Global Bird Watcher’s Conference’ is also organised from January 19 to 22 in Ahmedabad. “Gujarat is blessed with rich culture and geography. By organising this festival, we have been trying to showcase its cultural heritage and modern opportunities. 

Thus, we have blended culture tourism where one can explore Kutch village and its cuisine and also enjoy a ride in the hot air balloon, desert trekking and camel rides. There are many reasons for why one should visit Gujarat. Our packages are not very expensive and the beauty of Gujarat is yet to be discovered. Nature-lovers should keep in mind that Gujarat has 22 sanctuaries and four national parks,” said Sanjay Kaul, MD, Tourism Corporation of Gujarat (TCGL).  Biswas, the marketing manager was also present at the event.
