Ramani, a 13-year-old female elephant, died after a brief illness at Balle elephant camp under D B Kuppe Wildlife range in the taluk under Nagarahole National Park limits on Thursday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe deceased elephant was pregnant and had taken ill since five days. Ramani’s health had deteriorated on Thursday. It failed to respond to the treatment and succumbed.

Veterinarian Dr Umashankar was treating the elephant. Speaking to reporters, Dr Umashankar said the 16-month-female foetus, Ramani was carrying, could not be saved, as there was no amniotic fluid in the uterus. Postmortem was conducted and the carcass was burnt.

Ramani’s mother is Mary of Mathigoodu elephant camp. Mary, which was in Balle camp, was shifted to Mathigoodu three years ago, it is said. 

It was emotional moments for kavadi Doddappaji and others, who said, they had taken care of Ramani like their own child. ACF Sridhar visited the spot.
