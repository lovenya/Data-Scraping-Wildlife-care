As many as 25 blackbucks were found dead after having reportedly consumed pesticide and fertiliser used for maize crop in Mahabubnagar district of Telangana, forest officials said today.

Villagers of Gummadam, on the banks of river Krishna in Mahabubnagar district, yesterday noticed the blackbucks dead and informed the matter to forest officials.

"A total of 25 blackbucks have died...we took samples from every carcass and will send it for forensic examination to know the exact reason of their deaths," Reddy told PTI over phone, adding all preventive and precautionary measures have been undertaken to ensure that such incidents do not recur.

The maize crop has been destroyed, he said.
