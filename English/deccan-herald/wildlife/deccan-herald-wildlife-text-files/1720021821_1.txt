The students have set-up a stall for People For Animals (PFA), which has been working to create a strong network of committed people who will protect animals against cruelty and work to bring about a change in attitudes, laws and lifestyles towards improving conditions for animals.

Speaking to City Herald, PFA volunteer admin Vashista S R said about 30 volunteers visit the animal care facility located near Roopa Nagar on Sundays and national holidays to care for the pets. Being students of SJCE, they have decided to set-up the stall in order to raise funds needed for the upkeep of animals. He said volunteers have contributed to sell t-shirts, pens and keychains to support PFA. “The stall has been put-up to improve awareness among youth on how they can contribute to PFA,” he added.

Vasishta said volunteers would be involved in taking care of pets. Those who are afraid of animals can participate in gardening and also help administrative staff in the maintenance of the facility. On becoming a volunteer mentor, they can train new volunteers at the facility. They can also participate in fund-raising events.

Those who wish to donate can sponsor food items such as rice, ragi, oats, milk, fruits and vegetables or salary of any of the employees for a month. People who wish to own a pet but are unable to do so can help PFA by adopting an animal at the shelter. As sponsors you can visit the PFA whenever you wish to and spend time with the animals. Facilities at PFA.
