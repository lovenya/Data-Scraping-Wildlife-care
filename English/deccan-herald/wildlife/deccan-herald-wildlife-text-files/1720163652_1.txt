Governor Vajubhai Vala on Wednesday has urged the Forest department to ask industries to take up large-scale afforestation.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking at the valedictory function of the 61st Wildlife Week celebrations here, he said industries should maintain saplings for at least five years, after which, based on the survival of trees, the government should financially reward them.

This is the need of hour as the number of trees per acre in the State is dwindling. The governor, along with Forest, Environment and Ecology Minister Ramanath Rai, presented awards to students who took part in painting and essay-writing competitions.

The first-prize winners of the painting competition in different categories were — Prajwal P V, Himanshu Jyothi Kala Peetha; Kyathi Chembeti, Presidency School; and Apeksha Pai, VPS School. The essay-writing competition first-prize winners under the Kannada and English categories were Shashank S Kulkarni, Government Boys’ High School; Ape-ksha Pai, VPS; Yatheesh Kum-ar M, Government FG College; and Pavithra U S from M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology. Five forest officials — Manjunath P O, Vinod Gowda S, Prashanth H C, Shivaraj S and Siddaraju Nayak — were honoured, too.

Informer arrested

On the sidelines of the event, Rai said he wasn’t aware of the recent arrest of Forest department informer Selvakumar in the BRT Tiger Reserve and that six kg of tiger bones were seized from him. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Ravi Ralph said the investigation was under way.

Rai said the forest department would hire more frontline staff and was working to hike the hardship allowance. It is also considering hiring ex-servicemen to give arms training to ground staff, he added.
