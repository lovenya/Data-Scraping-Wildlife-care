Quarantine

Although the animals had arrived at the zoo some days ago, they had been kept quarantined to enable them to acclimatise to the new environment.

After two decades

Speaking with reporters, Kumble thanked Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for sparing the lions in an exchange programme. The lions had been brought to the zoo after a gap of nearly 20 years.

 “The lions of Gujarat had not gone out of that state for many decades. This is for the first time Modi has agreed to spare the lions to a zoo outside Gujarat. We are indebted to him,” he said. 

The former leggie said he would request Vijay Mallya to help the Mysore Zoo to procure zebras from South Africa.

 “The zebras here are old. We have to add exotic animals and birds to the zoo for which he will use his good offices,” he said.

Expansion of zoo

Replying to a question, Kumble stressed on the need to expand the zoo. However, it was left to the State government to hand over the Race Course land for the purpose, he said. 

“I cannot comment on this as the decision has to come from the government,” he added. The presence of Kumble at the zoo surprised many a visitor from other States. Some took photographs of the cricketer on their mobile phones and a few took his autograph.

He also stopped by at a shop in the premises of the Zoo where his children purchased toys.

M N Jayakumar, member-secretary, Zoo Authority of Karnataka, K B Markandaiah, executive director, and Vijaykumar, deputy director of the Mysore Zoo were present.ADVERTISEMENT
