Traps were laid at different places close to the footpath last week. And the male leopard walked into one of the traps kept near Sri Prasanna Hanuman statue on the hillsÂ  on Saturday morning, officials said.

Tirumala residents said more than half a dozen leopards, including a female with three cubs, were on the prowl in the forest areas near Balaji Nagar, Narayanagiri Hills and ghat roads.
Two girls were injured in separate incidents when they were attacked by leopards on the footpath while passing through forest, following which the path was closed during nights.ADVERTISEMENT
