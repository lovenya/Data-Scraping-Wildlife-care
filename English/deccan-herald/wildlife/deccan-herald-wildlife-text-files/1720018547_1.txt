Taking into consideration the increasing man-animal conflict and the impact on the fragile eco-system of Western Ghats, the officer has cancelled permission granted by Maruti Powergen Limited, a City-based private power generating company on April 15, 2010 (order no.MAG/2/2010-11) to dig a 1.6-km tunnel through the Western Ghats. 

The tunnel is part of a mini-hydel project. Huge quantities of ammonium nitrate prills were being used as explosives for tunnel construction. 

“Several villagers around this forest range have been complaining of tremors and the noise of explosion for a long time. This will have a serious impact on the wildlife especially elephants,” says Hari Somashekar of Wildlife Matters Trust, a City-based organisation that was instrumental in cancellation of this permission.

Wildlife experts say that elephants being sensitive animals, can hear noises from long distances. “They tend to avoid the areas where blasting is carried out leading to shrinkage in their home ranges. This will force the animals to new areas and thereby human habitations,” says Hari.

Pointing out that Hassan is one of the districts in the country which frequently witnesses human-elephant conflict, Hari says that such projects are bane to the wildlife and its habitat.

“The region is home to the Gundia Indian frog and the Kottigehara bush frog. These frogs are critically endangered, we therefore welcome the bold decision taken by the deputy commissioner,” adds Hari.

This area is also home to some of the highly endangered wildlife, including the recently discovered Travancore flying squirrel (established by H N Kumara and others in 2006), noctorunal bird Ceylon frogmouth, lion-tailed macaque, slender loris, Nilgiri marten and other arboreal creatures.
