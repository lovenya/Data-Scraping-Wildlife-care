Kodagu Zone Chief Conservator of Forest Jagmohan Sharma has submitted a report to the State government that permission should not be given to proposed Ezhimal-Bengaluru inter-state road which would pass through Talacauvery Wildlife Sanctuary.

ADVERTISEMENTThe proposed project (Ezhimal- Vellur- Padiyottuchal- Cherupuzha-Pulingome-Talacauvery) would pass through Mundrotu- Talacauvery- Bhagamandala, which is a part of the wildlife sanctuary known for biological diversity.

 The officer, in his letter to the government on September 2, has said that the region is part of the Western Ghats, with evergreen forests and grasslands. The road construction, allowing public intervention would adversely affect the wildlife, and the government should reject the proposal of the Kerala government, the letter states.

Madikeri Division Deputy Conservator of Forest Shivashankar also opined the same. The road from Mundrotu to Talacauvery comes under Padinaalku Naadu reserve forest, where there is a rough stretch with a width of 7 to 10 feet.

 To convert it as an inter-state road, it should be widened. In many places, new roads will have to be constructed between the mountains. It would impact the wildlife. Also, theft of trees would increase, the DCF has mentioned.

There is an alternative road to the proposed road already between Bhagamandala- Karike-Â  Mundrotu. However, the only problem was that commuters would have to travel 39 km more than the proposed plan. Just to cut the distance, it was not fair to construct an inter-state road, which would cause danger to the ecology, he has opined.

Speaking to Deccan Herald, Shivashankar said that the report was submitted by DCF Hanumanthappa to the government before his transfer from the district.
