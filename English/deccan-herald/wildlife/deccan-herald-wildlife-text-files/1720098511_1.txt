Karnataka leads other states in conservation of elephants, tigers, lion-tailed macaque and leopards in India, said Forest Minister B Ramanath Rai.ADVERTISEMENTHe was speaking after inaugurating the three-day 4th Hakki Habba (bird fest) organised under the aegis of State Eco Tourism Development Board and Forest Department at Town Hall on Friday."The bird fest was started four years ago in Ranganathittu. Amateur bird-watchers and professional ornithologists will have an opportunity to observe the different species of birds during the three-day Hakki Habba," said Rai."People are aware of the need to conserve animals, especially after the Wildlife Act came into force, yet animals are being killed for various reasons. There was a time when human beings took shelter in caves for protection from animals, today the roles are reversed. People should avoid killing animals as far as possible, but there is a decline in killing wild animals for food to a great extent," he said.Rai also unveiled a sticker, pamphlet and tourism map pertaining to birds.The main attraction of the event will be Pelagic birding, shore birding, estuary and riverine birding. The aim is to draw the attention of enthusiastic conservationists and explain about the various types of birds and their ecological importance.Soon after the inaugural, enthusiasts were taken to watch birds. Five boats were arranged for pelagic birding and will be taken early morning. Bird movements will be watched in the backwaters too.Drawing & quiz contestDrawing and quiz contest will be held for schoolchildren on birds, at Pilkula Science Centre on February 10.
