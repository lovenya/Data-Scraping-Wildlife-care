The role of locals is suspected in the recent death of a tiger, which was found with its paws and jaws missing at Bandipur Tiger Reserve, Gundre Wildlife Range in H D Kote taluk. 

ADVERTISEMENTA 10-year-old male tiger was found dead on Monday evening with its paws and teeth removed and prima facie it seems the big cat was killed for its claws and teeth. 

Experts suspect the role of locals since professional poachers would not have spared the tiger pelt which is worth lakhs of rupees. 

A similar case was reported about 10 years ago when a tiger in the region was killed for its claws and teeth. 

A black panther and its two cubs were also poisoned to death in a similar manner in Hanchipura village, Omkar forest range, Bandipur forest limits, in July. A dog’s carcass was reportedly used to poison the panther.

Poisoned

A calf’s head and legs were found near the carcass of the tiger. A Forest Department official, on condition of anonymity, told DH that the calf might have been killed and used as a bait. He said miscreants might have tracked the tiger’s movements and may have killed the calf and laced it with poison before using it as a bait. The tiger consumed the carcass and might have died within a few minutes. Poachers then removed its paws and jaws and escaped, he said.

The expert said habitual poachers usually kill tigers by shooting them down and are not likely to adopt the elaborate process of poisoning a calf to kill a tiger in a populated area.

International mafia

There is also a suspicion that international poachers or wildlife mafia are involved in the act. Experts believe that such poachers may have lured locals with money to kill the tiger. The wildlife mafia is believed to have become tech savvy by switching to online trading to rope in international customers as there is great demand for tiger parts in China and South Korea.
