The Forest department officials have not found any camera trap evidence confirming the presence of a wild tiger inside the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), since last few days.

ADVERTISEMENTOfficials opine that the tiger sighted at the Bannerghatta Biological Park safari area might have moved to Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS) or to Hosur in Tamil Nadu.

Sunil Panwar, director, BNP, told Deccan Herald that after the tiger was directly spotted on Saturday (July 4), and more pug marks found on Sunday (July 5), no other evidence has been reported.

It can be recalled that on Saturday, a group of safari visitors and a BBP safari driver sighted a wild tiger at the BBP Mulegundekere safari area (near animal rescue centre), which is a part of BNP, located 37 km from the City centre. Camera traps were laid at these locations to gather photographic evidence.

“We have still not got any camera trap details of the presence of tiger. Neither, are there any signs of fresh pug marks or kills. It is possible that the wild cat might have returned the way it came or might have strayed further south,” Panwar said.

With a number residences and commercial units in the vicinity, residents fear that the tiger might wander out of forest area and harm them, in the absence of a proper buffer zone. They want the tiger to be either captured or relocated. They are demanding the Forest department to issue safety guidelines and warnings. There were also reports of tiger pug marks being sighted near Chaverakal last month end.

K V Vasantha Reddy, deputy conservator of forests, CWS, said Chaverakal is located at the north-west tip of CWS which connects BNP. 

It could have been possible that the tiger might have strayed from Chaverakal. The location where the pug marks were sighted last month did not have camera traps.
