For the first time, Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) celebrated the birthday of two hippos and hosted a party for visitors. 
On Friday, BBP celebrated the birthday of hippos Naga (14) and Karthik (25) by cutting cakes made of hay, banana, grass and watermelon. While many visitors took photographs of the celebrations, the most delighted among them were 180 children of grade one and two from School of India. 

“This is the first time such an event has been organised and we aim to do it regularly. It is part of the awareness and educational programme which BBP has initiated. The zoo management has decided to celebrate all occasions including birthdays of animals. This will increase footfall to the park and also generate interest among visitors,” said BBP executive director Santosh Kumar. 

By organising birthdays of animals, visitors will learn about the species and the animals housed in the zoo. Not many knew that Naga is Kathik’s son. He was the first child of Karthik and Sita. Karthik was brought from Mysuru zoo in 1999 under the animal exchange programme, Kumar said. 

The day also coincided with Lion’s Day, where visitors, especially children, were taught how to identify the pug marks of different felines. A short film on lions was also screened. 

BBP aims to create awareness about all threatened species through interactive activities catering to all age groups. The zoo management also organises guided tours for school and college groups visiting BBP to involve them in wildlife and nature conservation, Kumar said.
