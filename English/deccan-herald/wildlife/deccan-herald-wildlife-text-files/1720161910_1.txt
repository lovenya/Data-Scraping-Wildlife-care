The tiger which had raised fears among the residents of Hirehalli village, in H D Kote taluk of the district, claimed the life of a cattle on Tuesday. Following the incident, Forest department officials have set up a cage to capture the tiger.

ADVERTISEMENTDuring the day, the tiger killed a cattle belonging to Kempegowda, a resident of the village. However, the tiger soon abandoned its prey and hid in a sugarcane field after villagers raised an alarm. On Monday, the tiger had attacked a cattle in the village during noon, and had attacked bulls on a bullock cart during the night. No persons were injured in the incidents. The village shares it border with Metikuppe wildlife range, of Rajiv Gandhi National Park, Nagarhole. 

Cage
Speaking to Deccan Herald, Director of the Park, R Gokul said that a cage had been set up at a field in the village, with a sheep as bait. “Staff of the department have been deputed in the village and a temporary camp has been set up to capture the tiger,” he said.
  
On Monday, crackers were used to drive the tiger away into the forests. Since, the method had not worked, cage has been set up, he said.

Gokul ruled out the possibility of using department elephants in the operation to capture the tiger. “The tiger is hiding in the fields, which are ready for harvesting. Using elephants for the operation might damage the standing crops, such as sugarcane and plantain,” he said.

During the day, residents of the village vented their ire against Forest department officials, for failing to capture the tiger, which has been active in the region during the past three days. Department officials feel that the tiger might have been pushed out of its territory, forcing it to attack cattle outside the forest.
