Amid fears that iconic tiger Jai may have fallen prey to poachers, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday formally requested the Centre for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the disappearance of the tiger.

ADVERTISEMENTJai is the star of the Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary, about 58 km from Nagpur and 60 km from Bhandara spread over Pauni Tahsil of Bhandara district and Umred, Kuhi and Bhivapur Taluka of Nagpur district. The 250-kg, seven-year-old Jai (official name UK T1), a male tiger, is missing since April 18.

Maharashtra’s Finance and Planning Minister Suresh Mungantiwar, who also holds the Forest portfolio, met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and made the formal request.

The development comes close on the heels of BJP MP from Bhandara-Gondiya, Nana Patole’s statement.
