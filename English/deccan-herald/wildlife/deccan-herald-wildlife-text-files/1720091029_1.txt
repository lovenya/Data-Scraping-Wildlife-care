He revealed that the night safari was initially planned till 11:30 pm but the protests led the authorities to cut it down till 9 pm. Since it is a matter related to tourism, the restrictions imposed by the Centre as well as courts on tourism activities in ecologically sensitive zones would apply in this case, Badushah added.While the Wayanad divisional forest officer said that the KSRTC was informed that traffic along restricted areas should not be carried out, KSRTC north zone executive director said that there was no violation involved as the Jungle Safari is not planned through any restricted routes or restricted hours.
