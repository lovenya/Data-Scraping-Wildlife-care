While the state tourism department is cashing on delegates participating in the Cospar (Committee on Space Research) Meet by offering attractive tour packages, the private parties; hoteliers are bitter that they couldn’t reap the maximum benefit. The eight-day Cospar Meet has more than 2,300 scientists from across the world including 800 from the country participating in the international event.

ADVERTISEMENTLooking at a huge potential at their doorstep, the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) has offered six tour packages to the delegates including four day-long and two half-day trips.

Speaking to Deccan Herald, KSTDC public relations officer Ratnakar said a majority of foreign delegates are making the most of the packages during their stay here. He said KSTDC is running Volvo buses on these routes. 

Having announced the package on the Cospar website has also added as an advantage to KSTDC as more people are aware about the packages, Ratnakar added. He said the buses are running full at the moment and foreign delegates have expressed their delight at visiting places such as Belur, Halebeedu and Srirangapatna. 

Also, the elephant safari at Dubare Wildlife Camp has also caught the attention of delegates, he said. In order to ensure a secure outing, the police department have provide escort jeeps and police personnel. KSTDC also set-up a stall to promote the Golden Chariot tours at the meet.

Meanwhile, hotel industry is unhappy at the number of delegates checking into the hotels and resorts in the city. 

The reason, Hotel Owners Association president M Rajendra says is that majority of delegates are staying on the Infosys campus.

He said even though more than 2,300 delegates have arrived only 300 to 400 are staying in the private hotels in the city. The Cospar website lists 20 hotels including five and three star, and budget hotels.

Rajendra said the Cospar didn’t help them. He blamed the hosts for taking away the business of hotels. He said the total number of delegates staying in hotels would be available in a few days following which they would submit a memorandum to the dist administration.

He said there are more than 5,000 rooms in the city, sufficient to house the delegates arriving for the meet.
