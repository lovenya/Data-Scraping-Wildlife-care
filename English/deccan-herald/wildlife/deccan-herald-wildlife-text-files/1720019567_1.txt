The wild jumbo is said to have entered farmers’ lands on Monday night itself and damaged the roof sheets of post master Srinivas’ house in Chakkodanahalli. Later, it was spotted on the lake bed. The efforts of the forest officials to drive away the elephant into the forest proved futile as the tusker got scared seeing the huge crowd.

As the crowd swelled, the pachyderm began to run helter-skelter and fell into a 20-foot open well, on the land belonging to Dore. The jumbo managed to come out of the well by climbing up the stairs. Later, it relaxed on the Heggadapura lake bed nearby.

With crowds gathered everywhere, the elephant could not find a way to the forest and took refuge in a bush on the land belonging to Satish and Raju. As it was already dusk, the forest officials returned hoping that the elephant would go back to the forest in the cover of darkness. But that was not to be.

The villagers said the elephant had damaged the drainage pit around 5 am on Wednesday at Town Panchayat member Nagaraju’s house. It also damaged some buildings and was spotted at Kenkare and Stadium Layout, damaging barrels stored with tobacco. It again took refuge on the Chakkodanahalli lake bed.

Crops were destroyed at Chakkodanahalli and other villages. Women and children in the villages are a anxious lot with the elephant creating havoc. Meanwhile, the public - who were disappointed at the failure of the forest officials to drive away the elephant - on Tuesday damaged the officials’ vehicles. CCF Ajay Mishra led the operation comprising DCF Manoj Kumar, ACFs Thammaiah, Chandrashekar and Manikantan. RFO Santosh Nayak and employees of Metikuppe and other forest zones are involved in the operation.
