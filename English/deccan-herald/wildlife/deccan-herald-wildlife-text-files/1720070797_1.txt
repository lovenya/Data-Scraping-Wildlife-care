The Delhi chief minister and I have now decided not to participate in the programme," Environment Minsiter Gopal Rai said on Sunday."Attempts are being made to malign our government. Satyendar Jain was arrested on frivolous charges. Now a conspiracy is being hatched to arrest Deputy Chief Minister (Manish Sidodia). The CM had to go to Singapore but the file was stalled," he said.
