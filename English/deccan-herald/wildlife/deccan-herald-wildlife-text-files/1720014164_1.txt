A decision in this regard was taken at a recent meeting of the National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) chaired by Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh.

Expressing reservation at the apex court order allowing bamboo harvesting, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) member secretary Rajesh Gopal felt that the activity would result in flow of people into protected areas, leaving the tigers to their mercy.
"Under the garb of bonafide use, the core areas of tiger reserves would be exploited for commercial gains by vested groups if the order was implemented," he pointed out.

The issue had come up for discussion after Orissa officials sought permission for removal of flowered bamboo in Satkosia Tiger Reserve as ordered by the Supreme Court in its recent judgement in line with the recommendation of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC).

Orissa Government was keen to harvest bamboo which is used for various commercial purpose with locals hugely depending on them.The CEC had suggested that the felling and removal of bamboo can be done by engaging only locals in the protected areas and in the immediate vicinity.

"The felled bamboo will be distributed to the villagers located within the Protected Area and in the immediate vicinity free of cost... and not for commercial purpose," it said.
However, Gopal noted that bamboo flowering occurs in various tiger reserves like Bhadra, Anshi and Dandeli and Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserves and allowing people to remove bamboo would pose a threat to the wildlife particularly tigers.ADVERTISEMENTRefusing to give permission for removal of bamboo from Satkosia Tiger Reserve, Rajesh said that the NTCA would soon file an affidavit before the apex court for reconsidering the judgement.

He also agreed to provide additional funds to the tiger reserves to help them take steps to prevent fires triggered due to drying up of bamboo groves in forest areas.Searing heat and absence of summer rain have put the forest areas in a perilous position with the forest officials taking several measures to check the fire incidents
