Sub-Inspector Thomas, head constables Lokesh, Srikantaswamy, Madevu, Doreswamy, Madeshaiah, driver Mahesh apprehended hunters who had hunted about 100 partridges near Gundal reservoir in the taluk on Friday afternoon.

Instead of taking legal action, the officials allegedly accepted a bribe and about 50 birds from the hunters and let them off the hook. 

The officials then took the birds to the farm of one Mahiam Das in Maria Mangala, Thomiyaar Palya, forced them to prepare a meal by killing eight birds and feasted upon the birds with booze.

Differed over distribution

However after they were suitably sloshed, an argument broke out between Sub-Inspector Thomas and H C Doreswamy about dividing the bribe. 

Dissatisfied with his share, Doreswamy complained to Superintendent of Police Dr T D Pawar. 

Following this, a case was registered against the SI and seven others. Police visited the farm and seized the remaining partridges.
