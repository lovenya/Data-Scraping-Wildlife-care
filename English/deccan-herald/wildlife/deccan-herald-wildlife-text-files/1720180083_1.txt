The City’s garbage crisis may now take a toll on the wildlife around the Turahalli minor forest near Banashankari. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has reportedly decided to set up a garbage-processing unit on 10 acres of land in BM Kaval.

 This area in Banashankari 6th Stage has been reserved for garden and is home to many wild animals such as mongoose and deer, B M Shivakumar of Jayaprakash Narayan Vichara Vedike told reporters on Tuesday. The BBMP is going ahead with its plan with the help of the police to crush any movement against the dumping of waste in the area.

“The decision is in gross violation of the Forest Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. The government and the BBMP should immediately to stop this project,” said Shivakumar.
