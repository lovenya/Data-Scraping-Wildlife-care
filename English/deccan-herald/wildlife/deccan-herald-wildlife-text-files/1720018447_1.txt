There is no dearth of temples that speak of the glory of ancient architecture. Bandalike, a tiny village in the region stands testimony to this glory.

Bandalike is nestled in nature’s lap and brings you a sense of peace and tranquility. This hamlet has been referred to as either ‘Bandalike’ or ‘Bandanike’ in the inscriptions. It is said to have been a major centre of Jainism and Kalamukha Shaiva sect in those days. The original name of Bandalike is ‘Nagarakhanda’. The inscriptions describe Banavasi as the face of the earth and Nagarakhanda as the decorative tilaka (marks) on its face. Bandalike was a key administrative centre during the reigns of the seventh-century Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas of Kalyana, Kalachurya, Hoysala, Sevuna and Vijayanagar kingdoms. Today, it is a tiny hamlet known for its famed Banashankari temple. This deity has many names including Vanadavva, Banadavva, Banashankari and Banadamma. There have been many debates about whether it is this Bandalike that has been mentioned as Maheshwari Kshetra in the noted Shivalli inscription. There are many similarities between the idol of Banashankari at Bandalike and the sixth-century idol of Maheshwari.

Puranic legends

Bandalike also celebrates Banada Hunnime, a jathre of the goddess here. The festivities add to the celebration of the harvest that happens around this time in the region. There are many mythological legends surrounding the temple of Banashankari. According to one Puranic episode, the gods decide to improve the lives of people on earth. While Shiva decides to send his disciple Prabhudeva to earth, Parvathi, his consort, decides to send Mayadevi to earth. 

Mayadevi is born as the daughter of Banavasi’s king. She is an accomplished princess, well-versed in the fine arts, from dance to music. Prabhudeva who is born in a common man’s family is an experted at playing the maddale (an instrument). Mayadevi seeks his hand in marriage, but Prabhudeva chooses instead to lose himself in dhyana or penance. Mayadevi looks for him everywhere, but eventually, a disappointed princess arrives at Bandalike.

It is widely believed in the region that the deity of Banashankari has the power to solve all their troubles. There are special prayers offered on Tuesdays and Fridays.

Apart from the Banashankari temple, the hamlet is also known for the Trimurthi Narayana temple, the Someshwara temple and the Shantinatha basadi. The Jain basadi stands testimony to the fact that Bandalike was home to many religions. The basadi constructed here dates back to the period of the Rashtrakutas. Inscriptions also mention that this basadi received the patronage of Jakkiabbe, the wife of a hero. The Trimurthi Narayana temple is a trikutachala temple, and dates back to the period of the Kalyana Chalukyas. The Someshwara temple, which goes by the name Aanekalu Somaiah and Beppeshwara was built by Boppesetti in 1274.

If you are in Shimoga district, don’t give this hamlet a miss. A treat of architecturally-rich temples, a Jain basadi and scenic beauty all await you there. Bandalike is 30 km from Shikaripura. 

Suma B JogihalliDiscover Shimoga* Most of Shimoga district is located in the Malnad region of the Western Ghats. The Malnad region is home to many rivers and rich biodiversity. Shimoga is the district headquarters.

* Shimoga is the land of many rivers. Important among them are the Tungabhadra, the Varada (Varadamoola or source of the river Varada is located six kilometres from the town of Sagar, a key town of Shimoga district. There are many dams too, including the Linganamakki dam, the Lakkavalli dam and the Gajanur dam.  Of Gandaberunda and other talesKeladi is a small town near Sagar in Shimoga district. Sagar, to most of us, is the nearest town to the famous Jog falls. This region was ruled by the powerful Nayakas whose glory is reflected through the temples they built in Keladi and Ikkeri. There’s also a palace in Shimoga that belonged to Sivappa Nayaka, the dynasty’s most illustrious ruler.

The ASI board in front of the Rameshwara temple explains that the temple is built in Hoysala and Dravida style. 

However the stone sculptures, the lion faced columns reminds one of Vijayanagara styled workmanship.

One of the main reasons for me to visit the temple was to see the Gandaberunda, the mythical two headed bird, which was also used by the Mysore kingdom and today is the Karnataka State symbol. The exquisite carving on the roof of the adjacent Veerabhadra temple did not fail my expectations. 

Though the Nayakas were Shaivaites, the sculpture in these temples are different from the Shiva temples further south. 

Temple tales

While Keladi’s Rameshwara temple looks simple from the outside, the nearby Ikkeri’s Aghoreshwara temple has a more majestic look. I loved the entrance to this huge stone structure. Its exquisite carvings reminded me of Belur. 

The Keladi Nayakas ruled over two centuries and through three main capitals – Keladi, Ikkeri and Bednur (Nagara). Two rulers of this region are very popular in the region. 

The first is the illustrious Shivappa Nayaka who defeated and ruled the entire coastal region as far as Bekal; the second is Chennamma who braved the huge Mughal army and gave shelter to Rajaram, the son of Shivaji.

Shivappa Nayaka ruled from 1645 to 1660. A powerful chieftain, he was also known as Shistina Shivappa Nayaka for his reforms to the land revenue system (shistu, discipline in Kannada). 

With a strong knowledge of agriculture, he classified land into five categories according to their fertility taking into account the average yield over a period of 13 years. It was during his tenure that the entire coastal Karnataka region was subdued and he went as far as Bekal and built a fort there.
