The decision to demonetise the currency notes faced with early hiccups as the banks did not have enough reserve to replace the scrapped notes with legal tender, said 14th Finance Commission chairman Y V Reddy, also former RBI governor.ADVERTISEMENTHe was speaking after inaugurating Mysuru Sahitya Sambrama, organised by Mysuru Book Club and Mysuru Literary Forum Charitable Trust, here on Sunday.Y V Reddy explained, “There was a huge confusion at the banks days after demonetisation. The confusion was due to a shortage in production of new notes, as the currency printing press could not meet the demand.”It takes months to produce around 70% of notes and moreover it is not possible to openly announce about it, he added.The former RBI governor said, “Huge volume of old notes were returned to the banks following the demonetisation of currency notes of higher values. It is up to the Income Tax department to decide on the extent of black money deposited with banks, post demonetisation. It is not possible for the banks to take a call on it. The I-T department has not kept the account of black money,
