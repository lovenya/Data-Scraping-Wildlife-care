However, Minchu is still critical and is under constant medical care as she is battling for her life.  

“She is still a cause of concern for us. For the last three weeks she has been on fluid therapy and is on force-fed,” said BBP authorities. Following an expert advice she is being provided with imported renal diet so as to reduce the pressure on her kidney. 

Dr G Pampapathi visited BBP and checked the condition of Minchu personally and offered necessary suggestions and guidance.ADVERTISEMENT
