Kannada movie on brigand’s life being shot inside elephant habitat ADVERTISEMENT<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2F2012%2F02%2F02%2Fforest-350.jpg?w=1200" alt=""/>‘Attahaasa’, a Kannada film based on slain forest brigand Veerappan, is again in the news for the wrong reasons. The movie by A M R Ramesh of ‘Cyanide’ fame is being shot in the forest area in violation of the Forest Act.

Shooting is currently underway in and around Gopinatham, the native village of Veerappan in Kollegal taluk of Chamarajanagar district. According to sources, the film crew is recording the sequences of Erakkam in Gopinatham forest range since Tuesday (January 31).

The burial site of DCF Srinivas, who was done to death by the sandalwood smuggler, a stream nearby, and the Cauvery Wildlife Area, have been selected as locales for the film.

The disturbance caused to the wildlife by using sound instruments, two lorries, generators mounted on a bus, and 12 other vehicles, besides LPG cylinder for preparing food have come under criticism. The film unit consists of 70 to 80 people.

Sources claimed that Erakkam is a restricted zone and activities other than wildlife amount to gross violation of the  Wildlife Conservation Act 1972.

Gopinatham Wildlife Zone is a habitat of elephants and activities, especially like that of shooting movies, will disturb the pachyderms. 

In addition to this, ‘Ishta Patte Kashta Patte’, another Kannada film, is being shot in Alambadi, adjacent to Gopinatham. A Tamil film is also expected to launch shooting here from February 8.

Strangely, none of the forest officers are aware of the film being shot there or of the violation of the Wildlife Act. With summer round the corner, the use of an LPG stove may cause fire, thus destroying the rich flora and fauna of the forest.

When Deccan Herald brought the issue to the notice of Deputy Conservator of Forests (Cauvery wildlife division) in charge Raviraj Narayan, he said ‘Attahaasa’ had sought the required permission from the Forest Department for shooting the movie outside the forest area. However, the officer said he was not aware of the movie being shot inside the forest. He also claimed innocence on ‘Ishta patte...’ team filming in the forest. 

He promised to initiate action after an investigation.

‘Attahaasa’ had recently hit the headlines when Veerappan’s wife Muththulakshmi allegedly took objection to the making of the movie.
