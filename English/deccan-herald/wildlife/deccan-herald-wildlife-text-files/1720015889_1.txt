A week ago, the park authorities had let loose a male crocodile into its pen, but a furious 'Gori' attacked it, officials said today.

It was the fourth failed 'matchmaking' attempt for the crocodile since its teenage days in the 90s, Prasanna Kumar Behera, Divisional Forest Officer Rajnagar Mangrove (Wildlife) forest division, said.

"As directed by the higher authorities, we decided to have another go. A suitable match was chosen from a nearby water body and released into the pond housing 'Gori'," Behera said.

'Gori' stayed motionless for sometime. Gradually it became restive and tried to attack the male crocodile, Behera said, adding noticing that 'Gori' was not inclined towards mating, the male was taken out of the pond and released into the wild.

'Gori' has been hogging the spotlight over the years for its eccentric behaviour. Living in captivity since birth in the sanctuary here, she continues to shun mates baffling the park authorities, the DFO said.

Its eccentric behaviour has been the subject of research by the state forest department but no conclusive findings have yet emerged, Behera added.ADVERTISEMENT
