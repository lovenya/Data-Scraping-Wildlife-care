Wildlife division conservator and Bhadra Tiger Project Director K D Upapudi said that Bhadra reserve forest would attract the attention of the nation with regard to security measures. 

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to presspersons, he said there would be no threat to wild animals in the forest. The animals have enough water facility inside the forest. As many as 51 villages come under the purview of the Reserve forest. 

“The people will have good opinion on the forest department, if 5,000 families are given economic stability. None of the families should be evicted forcibly. If they come forward to come out of the forest voluntarily, then a proposal would be sent to the government, to provide rehabilitation facility. Parisara Abhivridhi Samsthe has been trying to take up development work in the villages. Efforts will be made to supply LPG cylinders to all the villagers, to avoid them using firewood for cooking purpose.” 

Upapudi  said a proposal has been submitted to the government to lay 15 kilometre solar power fence, to check wild elephant menace. About 22.65 km solar fence has already been laid. 

The cost of solar fence per kilometre is Rs two lakh. The wildlife division had decided to lay 86 km long solar power fencing. “The villagers have sought 50 per cent assistance for laying Ibex in and around their land in the periphery of the forest. 

Compensation of Rs 11.94 lakh has been distributed for loss of crops by the wild animals in 152 cases. This year, Rs 8.50 lakh has been distributed.

He said “no timber smuggling has taken place in Bhadra reserve forest. The wild trees outside the forest were stolen in the past. However, now, the smuggling has stopped.” 
As a part of Wildlife week, various competitions were organised for the school and college students. The winners will be given prizes at the valedictory of the Wildlife week on October 10.
