The localites alleged that several such incidents have been taking place in this tourism spot, where the tourists violate the rule and torture other visitors and localites. Kudure Abbi falls is located within the D-line of Bhadra Reserve Forest. 

One of the residents Raghvendra complained that the tourists throw all garbage materials like plastic and liquor bottles near the falls. 

Wildlife activist Veeresh has urged the Forest Department to open a check post in Kudure Abbi region. 

Despite complaining with the Forest Department officials of Khandya check post about the problems faced by localites and wild animals, they have not taken any action so far, said Veeresh.

He has demanded the Department to fix a gate near the falls and has asked to educate the tourists about Wildlife Act. Veeresh further says that as most of the tourists who arrive at the place are from influential families, they easily manage to escape from the police.ADVERTISEMENT
