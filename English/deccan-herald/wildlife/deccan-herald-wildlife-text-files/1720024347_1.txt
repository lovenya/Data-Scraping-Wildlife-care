The Department of Forest has lodged a complaint with the Press Council of India against the commercial use of wild animals in television serials.

ADVERTISEMENTIn a letter to Justice Markandeya Katju, Chairman of the Press Council of India, B K Singh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), has said some TV channels were using wild animals in their reality shows to improve their rating points.

 Mere possession of scheduled animals amounts to an offence of hunting within the meaning of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the letter says.  Citing the example of an entertainment channel that recently used wild animals, he said three cobras were used in one of its programmes. In another serial, a parakeet in captivity was used to entertain the audience.
  
He said that the Department of Forest had asked the police to book a case against the director and producer of the programmes. 

To put an end to such acts of violation of Wildlife (Protection) Act, he has appealed to the Press Council of India to issue a direction banning commercial use of wild animals in TV serials.
