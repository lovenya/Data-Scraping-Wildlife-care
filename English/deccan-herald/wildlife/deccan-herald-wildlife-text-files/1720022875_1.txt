Two persons, accused in the murder of RTI activist Shehla Masood, will be produced in a designated CBI court of Indore today.

ADVERTISEMENTThe CBI had yesterday arrested architect Zahida Parvez, who was called for questioning at its office in Bhopal, and an alleged contract killer she claimed to have hired for the murder.

The identity of the contract killer allegedly hired by architect has not been disclosed.

The duo will be produced in a special CBI court of Judge Shubra Singh, sources said, adding both the accused were taken to Indore by CBI officials this morning.

According to sources, Zahida has confessed before CBI sleuths that it was she who had ordered Masood's murder because she was suspicious of the activist's relations with her husband.

On September 6 last year, CBI took over investigations into the murder as no witnesses were coming forward to share any information although the shooting had taken place in broad daylight in a posh locality here.

Masood was shot dead outside her house at Koh-e-Fiza locality on August 16, 2011 when she was going to take part in protests in support of Jan Lokpal Bill.

Masood was an RTI activist who had worked in several areas including environment protection, conservation of wildlife and anti-corruption movement.
