Delhiites are just a click away from getting clearances for felling trees and cutting their branches in their localities.

ADVERTISEMENTThe Forests and Wildlife Department has operationalised its website for people to take clearances online. 

“People can visit treeremoval.delhigovt.nic.in to take permission from the forest department. This will reduce the time lost by citizens in visiting various offices of the forest department,” the department said in a statement.

“This will also facilitate government agencies and other institutions to get permission from the authorities to cut trees,” it added.

RWA gets funds
In November, 10 new resident welfare associations were financially helped by the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society to maintain greenery in 33 parks, of which 27 are in south Delhi and six in north Delhi.

Also, 22 RWAs are being helped to maintain 101 parks – 50 in east, 29 in south and 22 in north Delhi. “A total financial help of Rs 10.13 lakh has been released to 32 RWAs in Delhi last month,” the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DGPS) said in a statement.

The city government’s DGPS coordinates and monitors the management of parks and gardens with civic agencies. It also helps RWAs technically and financially to maintain colony parks. 

“In the past five years, it has financially assisted 329 RWAs to maintain 1,494 parks. RWAs and NGOs have planted 4.90 lakh trees and 6.25 lakhs shrubs in parks and other common areas,” DGPS said.
