A 5-gram transmitter, a rechargeable battery and a solar cell were fitted like a backpack on the falcons using a specially made Teflon harness and the birds are tracked using satellites.Some of them have lost contact, probably because the device may have developed a technical issues and stopped working.Phom said that they had started motivating local villagers to protect the Amur Falcons way back in 2008, following large scale killings and possible tourism prospects in the villages— which have mesmerising hills, waterfalls and colourful lifestyle of the ethnic tribes— during the roosting period.They also formed community groups including students to keep watch against hunting and constructed a watch tower to get a better view of the birds.
