Volunteers have collected samples of Tiger feces and are on a look out for other signs of existence of more Tigers.

The census will be held in three phases and the teams have completed first phase. In the second phase photo mapping will be undertaken based on the evidences collected during the first phase. Later, a grid will be made based on the information from two phases and counting will be taken up in third phase, said Bhadra Reserve Forest Wildlife Division Assistant Conservator of Forest Shanker.

“The census is being done in a distinct way when compared to last three years. So far the estimates say that there are about 58 tigers in Kudremukh as well as Lakkavali region. This year there are all possibilities of the numbers having shot up,” said Tarikere Assistant Conservator of Forest Manjunath.

Software Engineers Chandramohan and Chandrashekar from Bangalore who are now working as volunteers for the census say that they found a foot print of a large tiger in deep forest. The foot print was fresh revealing that the tiger had walked on the route just some time ago.

“We were eager to see the tiger and hence we proceeded clandestinely to get glimpses of the animal. However we could not see the tiger but we got to see the cave that the tiger must be using to hide, rest and attack its prey,” they said and added that they also collected sample of feces of leopard and wild dogs. Footprints of tiger cubs, bears, antelopes and elephants were also found by the teams.ADVERTISEMENT
