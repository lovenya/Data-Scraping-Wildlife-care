A criminal case has already been registered against the four -ime MP in a police station in Cuttack city under different sections of the Indian Penal Code. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by Sub-Inspector Amitabh Mohapatra. 

According to the junior police officer’s compliant, the incident occurred on Sunday morning when he was on duty at the Netaji  Birthplace Museum in the city which was crowded because of the birth anniversary celebration of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik was scheduled to attend a meeting at the venue. 

When the MP arrived on the spot he started scolding Mohapatra who was controlling the crowd  using filthy language alleging that the police officer was obstructing common people from entering the museum.

Soon after, Mahtab allegedly roughed up the officer. “I have received injuries on my face,” Mohapatra said in his complaint. The senior BJD MP is the son of eminent freedom fighter and former Orissa chief minister, the late Dr Harekrishna Mahtab.

Embarrassment   

The incident has certainly become an embarrassment for the BJD leadership. This is for the second time in recent months, the leadership of the ruling regional outfit in Orissa landed in an embarrassing situation because of the activities of party MPs. 

Just a couple of months back, another party MP, industrialist and Lok Sabha member from Kendrapara constituency, Baijayant Panda had stirred a controversy for flying a chopper into a wildlife sanctuary violating forest and wildlife laws.

The incident had triggered an uproar among wildlife activities prompting the Union Forest and Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, to seek a report from the state government.
