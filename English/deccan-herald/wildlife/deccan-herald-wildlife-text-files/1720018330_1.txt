One has not seen Sohail in front or behind the camera for a while. 

In a candid chat with Metrolife during his visit to the City for the Celebrity Cricket League, Sohail revealed that he will soon be directing a children’s movie, Sher Khan. 

“After Maine Dil Tujko Diya, I haven’t directed for a long time. I was busy producing films and waiting for the right script to come along,” says Sohail, who recently co-produced ‘Ready’.

One of the biggest motivations for him to take up a children’s film was his son. 
“Whatever excites him, excites me. I want to make a movie that will be liked by all and it was my son’s fascination with animals that provoked me to direct the movie,” he adds.    
It was no big surprise when he revealed that Salman bhai will be playing the lead. 

With a plan to showcase him in a totally different avatar he says, “Salman was excited when he heard the story and concept. We are currently working on the script and will soon start the shoot once the CCL is over.” 

Taking up a subject like Sher Khan comes with its own risk. The character is quite popular among ‘Jungle Book’ lovers.

“I know there will be huge expectations from fans, that’s why my entire team is putting in a lot of time and energy in getting the script right and making sure that we live up to all of their expectations,” he says. 

Sohail will be making the film in a three-dimensional format. “I am really excited that we will be making the movie in 3D. Since we are dealing with a subject like wildlife adventure, I felt that a 3D format will only help it become more effective. This is the first time I am dealing with this kind of technology and as soon as the CCL gets over, I will be neck deep in the making of Sher Khan,” he sums up.ADVERTISEMENT
