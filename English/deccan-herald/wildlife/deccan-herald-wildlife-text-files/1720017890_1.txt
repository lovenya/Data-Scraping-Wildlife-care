With more than 200 acres of protected forest being destroyed, the construction of the plant will further cause a problem to the elephant corridor, they observed. Furthermore, this would lead to elephants venturing into townships, they pointed out.

What has increased the angst among the residents is that the power generated wonâ€™t be supplied to the local areas. Instead it will be sold to private players.

Even though the Gundia hydro-electric project is temporarily on hold due to the incessant protests carried out by the people, the obstruction of two hydro-electric projects are equally necessary opined MJHS President H A Kishore Kumar.

He said that 11 small hydro-electric projects have been sanctioned in the Sakleshpur region. If all the projects come into being, then it will cause irreplaceable damage, he added.

Environmentalist Hemmige Mohan, Goddu Umesh, Samithi Secretary Shashi Kumar, District Wildlife Association president Attihalli Devaraj and others were present.
