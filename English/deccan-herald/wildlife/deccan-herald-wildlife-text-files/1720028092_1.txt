“Have dedicated channels for documentaries, educate and build the capacity of our rural people,” says three-time Green Oscar winner Mike Pandey. 

ADVERTISEMENTHe feels documentaries are an agent of change as they inform and educate the masses even in the remotest areas of the country.

“Even after 65 years of independence, 67 per cent of rural India is still without education, information, and the basics. If we have dreams of becoming a super power, the first step should be to educate and build the capacity of our rural people and rural India,” Mike Pandey, who specialises in wildlife and the environment, said in a group interview.

“We need to address species. There are over 1,100 commercial channels in the country, but there isn’t any single documentary channel dedicated to hardcore education,” he added. 

He was the first Asian producer-director to win a Green Oscar for his documentary “The Last Migration - Wild Elephant Capture in Sarguja” in 1994. Later, his documentary “Shores of Silence - Whale Sharks in India” won him his second Green Oscar. 

Film’s impact

The 24-minute film led to the ban on killing of whale sharks in India and their being declared an endangered species. The third one was for “Vanishing Giants”.

Stressing on the urgent need for documentary channels in the country to educate the people, Pandey said education is the backbone of every society. 

Pandey also felt that if regional cinema is integrated with Indian cinema, it will unite the nation.

Pandey was recently honoured with the “People of the Year” title at the 24th edition of the Limca Book of Records awards. Passionate about his work, his next is “Return of Tiger” with Amitabh Bachchan and actor John Abraham.

The film covers the inter-dependence and inter-connection that holds all life on the planet together.
