They noticed some tribals on a hunting expedition, carrying a dead deer. 

The forest staff reportedly fired a few rounds in the direction of the hunters and the latter retaliated.

According to Veeranahosalli Range Forest Officer, Kiran, the poachers could have been injured in the firing. In their enthusiasm to catch the poachers, the night-shift forest staff went in search of the tribal hunters, but had forgotten to wear their bullet-proof vests. When the hunters fired in the direction of the forest staff, a bullet hit the back of Siddaraju, who sustained injuries. 

He has been admitted to K R Hospital in Mysore and is under treatment. Another staffer, Basadenvaraju, escaped a bullet fired by the poachers, said Forest Warden Mahesh. Forest guards K S Manju, Ganesh, Shivalingaiah and jeep driver Manju were onÂ  the night shift.
