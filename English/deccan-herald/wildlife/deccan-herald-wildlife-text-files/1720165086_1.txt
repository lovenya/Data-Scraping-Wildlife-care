In a move to sensitize common people on wildlife and conservation, HD Kote Taluk Journalists’ Association roped in Dasara elephants to release its calendar at Balle elephant camp, near here, on Wednesday.

ADVERTISEMENTDasara elephant Arjuna, which is famous as the howdah carrier, along with Kokila and Ramani, released the calendar in the camp.

Speaking on the occasion, association president B Satish Aaradhya said, the taluk is rich in wildlife and forest resources. “In a move to create awareness among people on the importance of wildlife and natural resources, the association came up with the idea,” he said.
D B Kuppe Wildlife Sanctuary Range Forest Officer (RFO) K C Vinay said, the HD Kote forest range has thick forests and thus tourists from all parts of the State and from other countries visit the region.However, the incident sparked criticism from animal rights activists. Some alleged that the event violated wildlife and forest laws.

Chief Conservator of Forests Markandeya said, using the camp elephants for such an event would not amount to cruelty. “Tourists visit the camp to see the elephants closely. They touch the elephants, feed them and click pictures with them. The camp elephants are used to interacting with people, including the mahouts and kavadis, so it would not amount to cruelty,” he clarified.
