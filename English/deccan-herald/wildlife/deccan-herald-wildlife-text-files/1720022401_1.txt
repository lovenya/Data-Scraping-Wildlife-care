Model-actor Milind Soman, who left for a 1,500 km long marathon from here to Mumbai Friday, in support of a clean and green environment, says the world can be happier and healthier if each person does his bit everyday.

ADVERTISEMENT“I am sure if each one of us contributes in doing simple things like not wasting electricity, using water wisely, not taking the escalators, the world would become a better, healthy and happy place to live in,” Milind told IANS.

The Green Run is a part of NDTV's annual Greenathon.

The fourth edition of the run was flagged off at 8:30 a.m. Friday from Qutab Minar in the presence of Environment and Forests Minister Jayanthi Natarajan, actor Rahul Bose, and Kartikeya Sarabhai, founder-director, Centre for Environment Education.

The Green Run started as a 24-hour run in Greenathon's first year, which then progressed to a 100-km run in the second year.

The fit and fab Milind, 46, and his team took a huge leap for the third Greenathon by running over 550 km from Ahmedabad to Mumbai in 15 days.

They have now set out for their longest run so far -- 1,500 km in 30 days.

During their journey, they will weave through Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and finally end in Mumbai May 20 at the Yashraj Studios.

How will he manage the feat?

“My team of six and I will run for almost 10 hours every day and the remaining time, we will be visiting villages and meeting people who have done their bit to contribute to save the environment and also encourage others to do so,” said Milind.

The actor will also address key environmental concerns and participate in nature and wildlife-related activities such as tree planting and nature camps to spread the green message.

He will also use social networking to reach out to his fans and followers, as well as maintain a diary of his experiences all along the route.
