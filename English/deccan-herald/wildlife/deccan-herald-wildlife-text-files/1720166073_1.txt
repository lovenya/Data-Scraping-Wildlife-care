Ranthambore Tiger Reserve might soon lose the world’s oldest living wildlife tigress T-16, famously known as Machli, who turned 20 years, in May 2016.

ADVERTISEMENTShe has not made any movement in 72 hours. According to the tiger reserve officials, Machli, who is getting weaker with each passing day, has abandoned her territory and shifted herself to the premises of a ‘farm land of a private lounge’, next to the sanctuary.

Divisional Forest Officer Sudarshan Sharma, who is in the reserve with his team, told DH: “The condition of Machli is very bad. A team of doctors and staff is working in the premises. The food given to her remains uneaten. For the past 48 hours, she has hardly moved from the spot. Machli is literally surviving on water.”
 The doctors who are looking after her have given up on chemical immobilisation as she is old and cannot respond to the effect. “We cannot immobilise her as her body cannot respond and overcome the effect of chemicals. Doctors are now trying to mix some ‘medicines for her energy’ in the meat that will be served to her. But it will only work if she eats,” Sharma added.

Her latest condition has given wildlife activists a reason to worry. Rupesh Kant Vyas, a noted wildlife activist said: “Machli has lived her life like a queen. She is specifically applauded for her contribution towards conservation since two of her nine cubs are now raising their own families in a nearby reserve forest. Since the government earns so much of revenue due to her, the National Tiger Conservation Authority must depute a separate team for her care and a secluded reserve must be made so that she lives like a queen till her last breath.”

Many documentaries and short films have been made on Machli and owing to her popularity, she has also won the TOFT Lifetime Achievement Award. To add to her feat is the fact that she earns over Rs 66 crore a year for Rajasthan tourism.
