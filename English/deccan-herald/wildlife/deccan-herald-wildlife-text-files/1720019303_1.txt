 This has thrilled bird lovers, ushering in a debate on the sudden development. Some bird lovers had previously expressed concern that although this bird had been sighted in Makoota forests, there were no photographs or any concrete evidence to prove it was not just a claim.

However, now with photographic and video evidence, the existence of the bird in the region has been well established. “This year, we had more than a dozen sightings of this bird. We have records of sightings at the foothills of Pushpagiri, Brahmagiri and Makoota. We never had so many sightings earlier,” said Bopanna Pattada, a naturalist from Kodagu.

Bopanna rubbished claims that the sightings of these slow-breeding birds -- it only lays one egg twice a year -- could be the result of habitat destruction due to largescale felling in plantations and forests. He said a sizeable population of these birds had existed there for a long time and had just been discovered now. 

“First thing is this bird is highly sensitive and prefers evergreen patches. Secondly, being an insectivore, it prefers to avoid plantations with a lot of pesticide and insecticide. Consuming any insect in such plantation would be fatal to this species,” he explained.
Clement Francis, a bird expert and photographer, said: “These days, many enthusiastic and adventurous bird watchers and photographers are coming out with new findings and discoveries of hidden wildlife treasures. In addition to this, this bird camouflages so well that it might be mistaken as dry leaf litter.”

However, this development, according to bird experts, could not be termed an increase in bird population because the status of the bird was neither studied nor monitored in Kodagu. Bird lovers in Kodagu are now advocating protection of this bird’s habitat.
