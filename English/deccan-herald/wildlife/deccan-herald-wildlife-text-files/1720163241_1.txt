More than 12,000 birds of 26 species have been spotted in Assam's Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary during a week-long census, Forest officials said on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe birds were spotted during the census conducted by Assam Forest Department and prominent environmental organisation 'Aarayank', the sanctuary's Ranger Mukul Tamuly told PTI.

The avians include about 5,000 migratory birds, while the remaining 7,000 belong to local species, he said, adding more than a hundred Siberian cranes were also spotted.
The census was conducted by 40 people belonging to both the forest department and Aaranyak.

The sanctuary is famed for having the highest density of one-horned rhino per square kilometre.
