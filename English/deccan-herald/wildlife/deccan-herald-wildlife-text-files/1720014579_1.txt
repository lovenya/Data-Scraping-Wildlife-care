Mammoth turtle rescue efforts

Between June 25 and August 18, staff from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) moved more than 25,000 sea turtles eggs by road from northern beaches on the Gulf of Mexico to Kennedy Space Centre on Florida’s east coast. 

Throughout July, August and September, 14,676 hatchlings – mostly loggerheads (Caretta caretta) – were released into the Atlantic, according to FWS biologist Sandy MacPherson.

Turtle hatchlings leave the beach of their birth to follow currents to mats of sargassum seaweed, remaining there a year or more, eating almost anything that passes by and breathing air at the surface. This behaviour made them particularly vulnerable to contact with, ingesting or breathing some of the millions of litres of oil floating in Gulf waters during peak nesting season.The risk prompted FWS officials to take action. Although officials deemed the project a success, it did generate controversy. Possible effects on survival rate concerned some biologists. The final hatching success rate of better than 50 percent (14,676 live hatches from 277 nests of about 100 eggs each, or a potential 27,700) is roughly the same as that in the wild. But moving the eggs might have distressed or harmed the animals in unknown ways, says Robbin Trindell, a biological administrator at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in Tallahassee. 

Biologists are also concerned about possible disruption of imprinting, the process that enables female turtles to return to nest on the beach where they hatched. It is unknown to which beaches turtles incubated primarily on northern Gulf beaches then released from beaches on the Atlantic Ocean will return. Research suggests that imprinting relies at least in part on genetics.

Sompeta’s resolve to protect wetlands

On July 14, two people were killed at Sompeta in Andhra Pradesh’s Srikakulam district when the police opened fire on protesters. The people were incensed at the Andhra Pradesh government allotting a tract of Sompeta’s wetland, or beela, to a private firm there. The company plans to build a 2,640 MW coal-fired power plant on 480 hectares of the wetland.

Former Union power secretary E A S Sarma, now with a civil society group, said the company got the beela declared wasteland with help from Andhra bureaucrats. VIMTA labs in Hyderabad that prepared the EIA report did not state that beela is a wetland. At the public hearing, mandatory for environmental clearance, more than 90 per cent of the gathering raised their voice against the project. A day after the police firing, NEAA cancelled the environmental clearance to the power plant. 

Ritwick Dutta, who represented Sompeta’s farmers, said 10 institutes in the country, including the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa, had declared the land barren without substantiation. 

Beela and adjoining wetlands, including Kolleru Lak, are important ecosystems and biodiversity refuges. Over a thousand families depend on the wetlands for a living. Plans for thermal power plants in areas adjoining the wetlands could run counter to MoEF’s conservation plans for wetlands.
