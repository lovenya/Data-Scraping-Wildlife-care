Sources in the Wildlife Institute of India said the second report, which runs to over 200 pages gave an assessment of tigers across the country. “It is the largest ever exercise to count tigers in the country,” sources said.

Though the State’s wildlife experts attribute the contiguous forest as the reason for better conservation in the State, the second report ‘Tigers, co-predators in India- 2010’ stated that forests in Karnataka were not in a position to support the increasing number of tigers as their area had shrunk by 20 per cent.

According to the report, the data collected from the tiger habitats of 17 states in India, showed an average decline of 12 per cent in their area. However, the silver lining for Karnataka was that the leopard population in the State as well as the habitat was stable. 

The report also stated that the future of big cats appeared bleak unless measures were taken to secure the tigers’ habitat which had been lost due to various reasons, sources said.

It could be recalled that the recent census report had showed a marginal increase in the number of tigers in the State. It was estimated that tigers numbered 34 to 47 in 435.5 sq km of Sharavathi Valley (Anshi- Dandeli). The big cat population was estimated to be between 32 and 47 in Kudremukh-Bhadra region which spreads across 327.4 sq km. 

As many as 350 to 411 tigers had been estimated to be present in 5,033 sq km area of Nagarahole, Mudumalai-Wayanad region.
