The proposed Shishila-Bhairapura four-laning will destroy flora and fauna of the Western Ghats section in the region, claimed Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust Managing Trustee D V Girish, environment and wildlife activists Shridev Hulikere and G Veeresh.ADVERTISEMENTThe total distance of Ujire-Charmadi-Mudigere-Chikkamagaluru-Kaduru-Holalkere highway is 303 kilometres.LEA Associates South Asia, a private organisation, has prepared the blueprint for the four-lane connecting Mangaluru to Chitradurga through Bantwala-Nelyadi-Shishila-Bhairapura-Mudigere-Chikkamagaluru-Kaduru-Holalkere covering a distance of 357 kilometres. A preparatory meet in this regard has been convened at the DC's office.The proposal has mentioned that the widening of the existing Mudigere-Charmadi-Mangaluru road is not possible as the road is adjacent to a reserve forest.The proposed road will smoothen traffic and will also ease transportation of goods from Mangaluru Port.The Central Government proposes to construct the four-lane road through Shishila Bhairapura hilly region, instead of considering Charmadi Ghat, Shiradi Ghat, Kudremukh, Agumbe, Subrahmanya, and Sringeri."Though the state government dropped the road project on the stretch, some elected representatives mounted pressure on the authorities to construct the four-laning. If the road project becomes a reality, a large biodiversity will be lost. The Shishila-Bhairapura hill houses Miyaru and Kabbinale reserve forest. The hills and evergreen forests should not be destroyed in the name of development. The Central Government should immediately drop the project, the activists have demanded.
