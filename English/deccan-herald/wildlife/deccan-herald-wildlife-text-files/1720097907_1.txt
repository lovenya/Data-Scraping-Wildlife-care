Dandeli in Uttara Kannada was declared India’s favourite wildlife destination during the recent HolidayIQ’s Better Holiday awards.

Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation Chairman S A Hussain said this was the first time a destination in Karnataka had been conferred the ‘people’s award’. This is a boost to tourism and also shows more improvement is needed in other places, he said.

He said the award was given based on the review of domestic tourists. The award was not chosen by a jury. It is the tourists who have rated the place based on hospitality, affordability, connectivity, activities and location.

The award was announced on March 31, 2016. Hussain said though Bandipur and the Nagarhole Tiger reserves and Kabini are popular wildlife destinations and see huge footfalls, they were not preferred by people as the number of activities there are limited. But Dandeli offers wildlife safari, trekking, birdwatching, adventure sports and water sports. It has good connectivity to Goa, which is also a preferred location. Though Kabini has backwaters, it has only boating facility.
