A wild sloth bear caught in a poacher’s snare in Koratagere, Tumakuru district, was rescued by a six-member team in a two-hour long operation. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe female bear, approximately five years old, was found by local residents trapped in a wire snare around its waist. They immediately reported the matter to the Forest Department which called in Wildlife SOS –– a team from the Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre, for the rescue operation. 

The team led by veterinarian Dr Arun A Sha and range forest officer Chinnappa worked for two hours to cut through the snare which was made of a modified clutch wire and fence wire. Judging by the condition of the bear, it is believed that it had been trapped for about 15 hours. 

After conducting a medical examination and providing treatment, the bear was released into the neighbouring Thimmalapura State Reserve Forest. Chinnappa said, “We are putting in our best efforts to track down those responsible for setting up this illegal hunting device and engaging in poaching of protected wildlife species.”  The sloth bears are listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red Data List because of their dwindling population.
