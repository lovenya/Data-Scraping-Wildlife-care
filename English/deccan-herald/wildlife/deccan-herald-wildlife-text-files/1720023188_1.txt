"The Goa State Pollution Control  Board (GSPCB) has received letters from the forest department mentioning certain  mines located within a kilometre of wildlife sanctuaries," Sequeira told the  house. 

The minister however did not specify the exact number of mines in  the vicinity of the wildlife sanctuaries. "I assure the house, that within seven  days, air and water consent given to these mines will be withdrawn and they will  be directed to stop," he said. 

Sequeira further said that the  reconstitution of the GSPCB would help crack down on illegal mining.  

"Each department was playing football with such complaints earlier. Now  in the reconstituted GSPCB, all the heads of departments (related to mining)  have been accommodated. I hope this will mean a coordinated team effort from now  on. And these types of lapses will not happen," he said. 

Leader of the  opposition Manohar Parrikar alleged that nearly 18 percent of Goa's 33 million  crore mining exports were fed by illegal mining. ADVERTISEMENT
