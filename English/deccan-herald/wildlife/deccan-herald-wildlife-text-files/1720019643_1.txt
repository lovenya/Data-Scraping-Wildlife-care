When the officers arrived, along with equipment and staff for sand mining in the block identified by the department, residents from the surrounding villages rushed to the spot on hearing the news and drove them back from the tank.

For the last two years, rampant illegal mining in the waterbeds of various tanks in the taluk had led to drinking water crisis. Agricultural activities had been severely affected with most of borewells of the farmers going dry, due to depletion in groundwater level. Thanks to a few influential persons who are involved in illegal sand mining, the affects are borne by someone else.

Illegal mining

The officials of the Public Works Department were engaged in illegal mining, as the per the new sand policy. The residents alleged that it was not right on part of the Government to give persmission for sand mining. 

It should instruct the department to halt such activities, the residents added and also threatened the officials that if they continued to do so, they would launch a massive agitation.

The Nangali village is located 15 km away from Mulbagal. The River Koundinya takes its birth in Kurudumale village and flows towards the Doddakere in Nangali village. 
It further flows to Palamaneru at Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh and proceeds to the Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary. Due to land aquisition and lack of rainfall, the river dried up several years back and the river is not almost untraceable.

Spread to attract miners 

The Doddakere tank in Nangali is spread over 725 acres of land and helps in meeting the water requirements of Nangali, Kerasamangala, Maravemane, Kotturu, Mushturu, Jangalahalli, Yalavahalli, Gadduru, Mudugere, Venkatapura, N Kurubarahalli, Halekuppa and Thondahalli villages.

If the tank is full, then the farmers will be able to cultivate crops of more than 2,000 acres of land. But illegal mining has left more than an a 100 borewells dry and more than 200 wells dry. 

In spite of sinking borewells more than a 1,000 feet deep, was also not yielding any water. This has proved to be an alarming development for the people of this region.
Wednesdayâ€™s incident should indeed be an eye-opener to the officials and others.ADVERTISEMENT
