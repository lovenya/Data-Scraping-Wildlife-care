Selection of children
Every Bal Bhavan Society has been asked to select 15 to 20 children for Srujanotsava. Kalasrhree award winners will also be given a chance to exhibit their talent. 

Apart from this, the authorities have been asked to select 50 multi-talented kids from each taluk in Dakshina Kannada to attend the camp. At the same time, everyday 1,000 children from Dakshina Kannada district will be brought to the venue to interact with the participating kids, she said. In the four-day camp, one day will be reserved for activities in beach. 

This include kite flying with the help of Team Mangalore and the sand sculpture. Stating that Srujanotsava is being organised for the first time in the State, she said the programme is to commemorate the silver jubilee of Bal Bhavan Society of the State. The silver jubilee was held last year. 

The accommodation for the participating kids has been arranged at six places in and around Pilikula. All the children participating in the procession will be the main attraction of the inaugural ceremony. 
The children have been asked to wear  traditional dresses which reflects their state’s culture and tradition, said Bhat.
