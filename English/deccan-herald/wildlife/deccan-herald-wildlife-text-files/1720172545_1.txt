The WWF hopes that the clean and noiseless energy system will ensure water availability for the wildlife during the hot and dry season.

The Nagarjunasagar reserve spreads over the five districts of Nalgonda, Mahabubnagar, Kurnool, Prakasam and Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. The Krishna river flows through the reserve over a distance of 130 km. The multipurpose reservoirs, Srisailam and  Nagarjunasagar, which are important sources of irrigation and power in the state, are located in the reserve. The reservoirs and temples of Srisailam are major attraction for a number of tourists and pilgrims.

The area is hilly, considerably varying from plains to precipitous cliffs. More than 80 per cent of the area is gently rolling to hilly. The hill ranges contain a number of plateaus of which Amrabad, Srisailam, Peddacheruvu, Sivapuram and Nekkanti are famous among tourists.

The Wildlife is generally confined to plateaus during monsoon and in valleys during summer. The perennial water sources are generally located in the valleys and the plateaus suffer from acute scarcity for water during summer.

33-foot  tower

The solar-powered deep well pumping system that was inaugurated recently by Hitesh Malhotra, Chief Wildlife Warden, Andhra Pradesh Forest Department; consists of a DC submersible pump and has been installed inside a very old well in the Farahabad penta (village). The pump with the help of solar energy will pump up water to an overhead tank installed on a 33-foot high tower. The solar panel is fitted on top of the overhead tank. 

Water will be stored in this tank and the overflowing water will be discharged to a few nearby water percolation tanks and check dams. The water will also be utilised for developing fodder plots for the herbivores like Nilgai, Cheetal, Barking Deer, Barasingha which live in good numbers in the Srisailam and Nagarjuna Tiger Reserve area.

“We are happy that the WWF has come forward to provide a clean energy system in the tiger reserve where there is severe water scarcity in the summer months. Water was being brought in water tankers from Mannanur, 20 km uphill. The new mechanism will make water available at the site itself,” Malhotra observed.

Anil Epur, Chairman, WWF, said “the WWF has been providing infrastructure support such as wireless sets, vehicles and also setting up of base camps besides building the capacities of the forest department staff on wildlife crimes through motivation workshops and training to the forest communities on sustainable livelihood options. The solar-powered pump has provision for not only wildlife use but also for the local Chenchu families that reside in the Farahabad plateau.”

The WWF hopes that plenty of drinking during summer season will prevent the wild animals from entering nearby villages and tribal hamlets.ADVERTISEMENT
