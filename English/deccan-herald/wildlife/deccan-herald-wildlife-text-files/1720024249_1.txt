The conduct of Odisha forest officials and district authorities in rescuing a wild leopard that strayed into the headquarters town of Subarnapur has raised concerns among state wildlife activists, who allege that they have violated provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

ADVERTISEMENTThe animal was rescued from a fancy stores at a market place in Sonepur where it took refuge after straying into the town late on Thursday. 

It was then taken to the Nandankanan zoo and zoological park near here on Friday. “The entire episode was handled badly. Action should be taken against officials responsible for the violation of the wildlife protection act”, said Biswajit Mohanty of Wildlife Society of Odisha, a state based NGO.

He said putting a wild animal rescued from human habitat up for public viewing was against the Act.  The leopard was displayed on a cage for public viewing on Friday at the District Collector’s office. Even barricades were erected around the spot where the animal was placed, enabling local people to form a queue to view the animal. Some locals were taking a snapshot of the animal on their mobile phones. 

The activist also pointed out that since the animal did not sustain major injuries, it should have been released into the wild instead of being taken to Nandankanan which is 250 kms away. The minor injuries could have been treated locally. Forest officials, however, have rejected the allegations saying that they had no choice but to put up the animal for viewing to prevent law and order problems. The large crowd gathered Thursday night was insistent about viewing the animal and normalcy was restored only after the Collector assured the public that the animal would be displayed for viewing Friday morning.

The officials also said that there was no veterinary doctor at the district headquarters  to treat the leopard’s injuries, prompting its transportation to Nandankanan. However, the explanations failed to satisfy the activists.
