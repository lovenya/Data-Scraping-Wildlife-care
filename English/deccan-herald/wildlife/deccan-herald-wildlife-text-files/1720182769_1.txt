Alleging lack of basic facilities, about 75 residents in Hemmige village have decided to boycott the election. ADVERTISEMENTThe residents have been demanding a bridge across Hemmige stream at Bukkudibailu. Though Rs 68 lakh was sanctioned under Naxal package for the bridge, the work could not be taken up as the wildlife division officials have been posing a hindrance to the work. As a result, the work on the bridge has been suspended. "When the government could not provide us with basic facilities, why should we exercise our franchise," said Vijendra. The residents of Hemmige, Golimakki, Abbidare, Gocchehonda will boycott the election.
