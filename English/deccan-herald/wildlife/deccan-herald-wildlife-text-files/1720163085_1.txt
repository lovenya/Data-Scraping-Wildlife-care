A pelican that was streaked in green paint during renovation work at the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) died here on Tuesday morning.

ADVERTISEMENTOfficials were not aware of the death until BBP wildlife vets confirmed the same after a post-mortem. Sources suspect that the bird may have died as workers used harsh chemicals such as kerosene to remove the paint from its body. 

More than five birds, including pelicans and storks, were found streaked with paint a couple of days ago after green oil paint that was used to paint a bird enclosure spilled over. Due to the rains, when the birds swam in the paint-filled water, it got stuck to their body and many birds were found with a dark green patch of oil paint on them.
‘Utter negligence’ 

Sources said that it is utter negligence of Bannerghatta Biological Park authorities to have allowed workers to use kerosene on the birds. The fish fed to the birds were also in the paint-filled water. Instead of shifting the birds and then painting the enclosure, the painting work was carried out when the birds were inside the enclosure. 

The bird enclosure located inside the BBP houses a number of species including pelicans, storks, night heron and bar-headed goose. Also, there are more than 60 birds in the enclosure, making it very crowded. 

Sources added that the bird enclosure has not been well maintained. Moreover, due to shortage of water, birds are forced to the drink dirty water.

BBP’s executive director Range Gowda was not available for comment.
