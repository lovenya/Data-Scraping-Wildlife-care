A stray tiger which had sparked off panic in villages on the fringes of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary for the past three weeks and kept the official machinery on its toes was shot dead by forest officials on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENTSanctuaryâ€™s wildlife warden S Sreekumar said the big cat was spotted at Thelapparambu around 8:15 am. Though the combing team comprising sharpshooters and vets from Kerala and Karnataka fired a tranquiliser, the beast managed to escape. At the end of an hour-long search it was located in a coffee plantation in a semi-tranquilised state.

When another tranquiliser was fired at the tiger, it turned violent and made an attempt to attack the team members. Left with no other option, they shot it dead.
Sreekumar said it was a 10-year old healthy male.
