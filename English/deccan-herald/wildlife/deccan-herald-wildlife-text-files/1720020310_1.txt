ADVERTISEMENTFox History & Traveller presents ‘Poh’s Kitchen — Macaroons With Emmanuel Mollois’ on December 21 at 9 pm.

  Poh explores colours and tastes of two different cultures with French  chef Emmanuel Mollois, who shares a classic and a brand new recipe for  Parisian macaroons — the wild, flavour-filled biscuits in hundreds of  zany colours –– all these are a rage in Paris. 

Poh cooks a  Malaysian version of French macaroons — brightly coloured Malaysian  snacks with some surprise fillings — one that she remembers making as a  child and nicknaming as ‘Sticky Marbles’. 

Emmanuel gives Poh the  challenge of making a ‘Poh’s Kitchen’ macaroon and food matching with  tea — a wonderful way to complement or contrast food flavours with a cup  of tea! 

Emmanuel and Poh build a macaroon pyramid and Emmanuel tastes something he vows he will never eat again!
