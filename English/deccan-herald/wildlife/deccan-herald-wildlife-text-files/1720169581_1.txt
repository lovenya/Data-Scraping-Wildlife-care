An SSB sub-inspector and a suspected NDFB (S) militant were today killed in an encounter in the Chirang district of Assam.

Officials said Sub-Inspector Amal Sarkar was killed after a joint team of the 156th battalion of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Army and local police engaged in a gunbattle in the forests around Manas wildlife sanctuary in the district around 2:30 PM.

They said an unidentified militant of the banned militant group NDFB (S) has also been killed in the encounter. The troops had embarked on operations early in the morning and the incident spot is near the Dhaula border post of the SSB, the paramilitary that guards the Indian frontier with Bhutan.

The security forces have recovered an INSAS rifle from the encounter site and efforts are being made to recover the body of the militant, the officials said.

"A cordon and search operation has been launched in the area by the joint forces," a senior officer said.
The National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Songbijit) is responsible for many killings in the border areas of Assam and the security forces were out for a counter-insurgency operation when the encounter took place, they said.ADVERTISEMENT
