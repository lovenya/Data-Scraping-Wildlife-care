The court has fixed December 7 as the date for hearing the petition. The accused army personnel, however, denied the charges that they had killed three Chinkaras during Sudarshan Shakti, the ongoing war-game exercise.

 Pleading not guilty on the charges before an army court of enquiry, they said one Sukh Singh from Nimbla village had brought the Chinkara meat for them. A search has been mounted to find Singh. However, investigators, including the police and forest department officials, have rejected their story. 

Forest officials claimed that the accused army men will have to present themselves before the forest department, as the court of inquiry is a separate process.  On November 25, forest officials had seized severed heads and uncooked meat of three Chinkaras from the camp of 88 Armoured Workshop at Nimbla village in Barmer district. 

Subsequently, the five army men—Gopi Lal, BR Nath, N Sarkar, Pardesi and DR Naidu—were booked in the case under Sections 9 to 51 of Wildlife Protection Act 1972.ADVERTISEMENT
