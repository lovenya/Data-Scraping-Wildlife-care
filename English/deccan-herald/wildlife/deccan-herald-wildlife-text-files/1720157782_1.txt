An IT professional from the US, who was in the City to attend her younger sister’s wedding, fell to death from the balcony of an eleventh-floor flat in Sahakar Nagar here in the early hours of Wednesday. 

ADVERTISEMENTKavitha, 30, was drunk when she climbed onto the railings of one of the two sit-outs in the flat, in a bid to cross over to the other, separated by three feet. In a drunken stupor, she probably slipped and plunged to death, police said. She died instantly. 

In a statement to police, Kavitha’s friend Kalyan, a wildlife photographer, said he had warned her against her “adventurous streak”. She had managed to cross over from one sit-out to the other two weeks ago, police sources quoted the friend as saying. But her “misguided” adventure cost her life this time, he added. 

On Tuesday night, Kavitha and her friends — about eight of them — gathered at Kalyan’s house in the Alpine Pyramid apartment in Canara Bank Layout, Sahakar Nagar. 

The group partied until the early hours of Wednesday when Kavitha tried to get adventurous. In the flat, there are two rooms next to each other and both have separate sit-outs with a gap of three feet between them, police said. A senior police officer said the deceased was drunk when she tried to get “adventurous”. 

Kavitha’s father Armugam and his wife, who were in Kerala on Tuesday, returned to the City on Wednesday afternoon. The family, which lives in Rajajinagar, refused to speak to the media. The flat was locked following the incident. 

The deceased had been working in the US for the last eight years. She was not married yet. She arrived in the City three months ago on a vacation. She was to go back to the US after her sister’s wedding in a month’s time, according to police sources. 

The post-mortem was conducted at M S Ramaiah Hospital, but the family said it would collect the body on Thursday.
