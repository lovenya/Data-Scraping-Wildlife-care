Along with the animals in Bandhavgarh, others like the star-nosed mole which uses bubbles underwater to prey, stalkflies which grow eyes on long stalks and the male dawson's bees who commit mass murder to gain access to a female, all figure in the documentary series.

Narrated by veteran wildlife filmmaker David Attenbourough, the 10-part epic series "Life" by Discovery Channel comprise 130 stories which reveal the behaviours that living creatures have devised in order to survive. The programme scheduled to go on air from May 24 has been dubbed in Hindi and Tamil.

"The dubbing process is the reason for delay of its release in India", says Rajiv Bakshi, Vice President, Marketing as the series had already been launched in the US on March 22. "Discovery has collaborated with BBC Natural History division to produce this never-before-seen visual masterpiece", Rahul Johri, senior Vice President and General Manager of Discovery Network Asia-Pacific told reporters.

Each episode in the series focuses on different group of animals like reptiles, mammals, fish, birds, plants etc. Around 120 camera crews shot the visuals across seven continents spending over 3000 days. "Footage from Bandhavgarh national parkÂ  is featured in the seventh episode of the series," says Vikram Channa, Discovery.ADVERTISEMENT
