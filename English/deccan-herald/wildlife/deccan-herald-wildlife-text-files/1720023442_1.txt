The orange glow of lamps at the India Gate blinked off, letting stars shimmer down as the lights at the monument were switched off to mark the fifth Earth hour at 8:30 pm Saturday. 

ADVERTISEMENTSome 200 cadets from the National Cadet Corps formed '60+', the Earth Hour logo, in front of India Gate. 

The event, organised by World Wildlife Fund, symbolised the “need to mark these 60 minutes with our willingness to conserve energy and then go beyond the 60 minutes of Earth Hour”, said Rudra Ghose, a co-ordinator at the event. 

"The Earth Hour campaign has gained the momentum that carries it to every corner of the country," said Sejal Worah, WWF programme director. 

Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar is the brand ambassador for the campaign in India. 
Science Popularisation Association of Communicators and Educators (SPACE), an amateur astronomy organisation, set up telescopes at India Gate to let the public observe the night sky without the light pollution caused by the lights at the monument.

"Now that the lights are off, the sky has become clearer and many stars could be seen which were earlier too dim to be seen in the artificial lights," said Sneh, one of the SPACE volunteers.
