The message of secularism was in the air as Tejaswini Gowda’s electoral caravan traversed the narrow lanes of Basavanapura.

ADVERTISEMENT“We the members of Congress party do not subscribe to the divisive politics based on caste, creed or religion, but believe in taking everyone together,” she said from a truck converted into an election chariot. 

The journalist-turned-Congress leader is trying her luck from Bangalore South, which is the biggest Assembly constituency, spread over 30 km from Uttarahalli to Electronics City. 

Politicians regard this constituency as a gamble since a serious contest would require a huge ‘investment’. Defeat would mean a massive loss. The odds, however, are against the Congress. The BJP has been winning this constituency for the last 16 years. Except for the BJP, other parties in the past have only fielded their candidates from this constituency for representational purpose. 

This time, the Congress regards Gowda as an ace up its sleeve. She has achieved notable electoral victory in the past. In 2004, she defeated former prime minister H D Deve Gowda from the Kanakapura Lok Sabha constituency and has since gone from strength to strength. 

Her aides told Deccan Herald that she knows her votebanks well for the elections. Gowda’s message of secularism overwhelmed the residents. After her speech ended, supporters trailed Gowda’s truck, raising slogans in her favour. 

Speaking to Deccan Herald, Gowda said the morale of the minorities in her constituency was low as they felt insecure.

 Environmental issues top her agenda as she is aware of the fact that this constituency has a large number of water bodies, forested areas, scenic hillocks and wildlife. At Basavanapura, however, her priorities revolve solely around secularism.
