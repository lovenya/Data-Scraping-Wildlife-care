Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan has said she is not keen on doing films in the southern movie industry as she doesn't understand the language.

ADVERTISEMENTWhen asked if she is willing to work in Tamil, Telegu or Malayalam films, the 36-year-old actress said, "I truly respect all south films they have great content, I respect and admire them. There are great actors from Pawan, Rajinikanth sir to Mammooty sir.

"There is so much great work being done in Telugu or Malayalam films. I don't understand the language and so I feel the connection will not be there. That's the only problem," Kareena told reporters here at an event.

She added, "Having said that one of the best films in my career was with a great director from south, Mani Ratnam. I got the opportunity to work with him and it's great." Kareena acted in Mani Ratnam's 2002 film 'Yuva'.

The 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' actress was speaking at the launch of Sony BBC Earth in India, which will go live on March 6. "I am in the best phase of my life now. I am happy and I look at life and everything with positivity," she added.

The actress said she is fascinated with nature, adventure and wildlife. "Both Saif (Ali Khan) and I love wildlife and adventure and we do visit a few places. We also watch wildlife, national history shows. I also like watching comedy shows," she said.
