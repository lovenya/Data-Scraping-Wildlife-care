The moment bamboo flowers is when it means its life is over, explains Shimoga’s Conservator of Forests Brijesh Kumar. According to the Indian Board of Wildlife, this bamboo should be allowed to disintegrate and become one with the earth, once it dries up.

But, bamboo lying uncut is cause for another fear. That of forest fires. The Forest Department has corresponded with Delhi’s IBWL in connection with chopping the bamboo. 
The Board is headed by the Prime Minister, and doesn’t meet often to take decisions. Meanwhile, the Forest Department in the Shimoga region is awaiting communication from the Board before it can chop the bamboo.
