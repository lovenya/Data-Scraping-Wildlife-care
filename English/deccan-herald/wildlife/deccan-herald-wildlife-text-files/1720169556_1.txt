Capitalists have been setting Kappatagudda on fire with the sole objective of showing that there is no vegetation and wildlife in the hills, alleged Tontadarya Mutt seer, Siddalinga Swami.

Addressing a press meet here on Sunday, the seer said that “agents of a mining company” were behind the fire incidents at Kappatagudda. 

He said that district in-charge minister H K Patil has been requested to convince the petitioners in the plea filed in Karnataka High Court against conservation reserve tag for Kappatagudda, to withdraw their writ petition. 

Unprecedented drought 

“The state is facing unprecedented drought since due attention has not been paid for environmental conservation. While we are reeling under water scarcity, wild animals are straying into human habitats. The government and the elected representatives lack concern for environment,” he said.
