The Forest department was making efforts to rescue the tiger. On Wednesday morning, the carcass of the tiger was found floating in the backwaters. Veterinarians who examined the carcass said the death may have occurred three days ago. The tiger’s death has raised suspicion of poaching as its claws were found in a plastic cover tied to the animal’s left limb.Tiger Project director Ravishankar said prima facie, the tiger appears to have died of electrocution while crossing a wired fence. “There are signs of electric shock on its abdomen.

A probe will be conducted,” he said.Pug marks of another tiger were found near Kaav Resort, Antharasanthe wildlife zone, in the taluk.A 50-year-old female elephant died in Anechoukuru forest, under Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, Hunsur taluk of the district on Tuesday.According to Nagarahole Tiger Reserve director Ravishankar, the animal may have died of injures sustained in a clash with other elephants, he said.
