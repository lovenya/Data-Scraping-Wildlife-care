Erin Brockovich, whose environmental saga was vividly chronicled in a motion picture, was arrested on suspicion of boating while intoxicated on Lake Mead near Las Vegas. 

ADVERTISEMENT"Brockovich was arrested late Friday night after breath tests showed her blood-alcohol level was just over twice the legal limit of .08," the Huffington Post quoted Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Edwin Lyngar as saying.

She was reported to have been released on bail on posting a bond of $1,000. 

Brockovich's legal fight against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company for alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium was essayed by director Steven Soderbergh in the 2000 classic, with Julia Robert playing the activist.
