The 45-day long tiger census has commenced at Lakkavalli and Thanibebail from Monday.  

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing a press meet, Wildlife division Conservator Venkateshan said that 80 cameras will be used for conducting census. After completing the census here, the cameras will be fixed in Muthodi Bhadra wildlife division. “As we have shortage of tiger trapping cameras, the census can not be taken up at a time in the district,” he said.

The National Tiger Conservation Authority has given its nod to purchase cameras. A total of 184 cameras will be purchased. Tender has invited for the same and Monday was the last day to file tender. One camera was damaged by an elephant and another was stolen by miscreants. The census will be held twice in a year—pre monsoon and post monsoon, he said.

The Muthodi Bhadra wildlife division, Lakkavalli and Thanigebailu division census will be completed by next month end. “We can ascertain the number of tigers captured in the camera in February. There are 36 anti poaching camps in Muthodi, Lakkavalli and Tanigebailu. Each camp should have four staff. Instead, there are three persons in each camp. A total of 108 daily wage labourers have been hired on contract basis, he said

“It has been decided to promote eco tourism in the region. Through Bhadra Conservation Foundation, safari will be introduced while boating will commence in Lakkavalli,” he added.
