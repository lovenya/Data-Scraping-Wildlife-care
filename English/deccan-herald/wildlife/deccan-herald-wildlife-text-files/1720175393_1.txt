A mention made by Congress president Rahul Gandhi about the night traffic ban along the highways at Bandipur national park connecting Kerala and Karnataka has raised a concern among environmentalists.ADVERTISEMENTWhile listing out the development needs of Wayanad at an election campaign here on Wednesday, Rahul said he was aware of the difficulties being faced by people over the night traffic ban.He added that he was also aware of the conflict between environment and development, and that he believed there would be a solution for all issues.Incidentally, environment protection forums of Wayanad had recently prepared a people’s charter that stressed the need for protecting the district’s ecology and sent it to Rahul Gandhi also.The Wayanad Nature Protection Group president N Badushah told DH that Rahul seemed to have mentioned about the night traffic ban owing to pressure from local politicians. A strong lobby that exploits nature in the name of tourism was trying to lift the traffic ban. But Rahul’s remark that he was aware of the conflict between environment and development gives us hope that he would not go for any steps that might affect wildlife, he said.Badushah also said that Rahul should have focused more on issues of the tribal population and farmers of Wayanad. Five farmers have committed suicide over the last seven months owing to debt pressure, he said.Ban protects wildlifeThe Karnataka High Court in 2009 imposed the night traffic ban along 42 km of two national highways passing through Bandipur considering petitions seeking protection to wildlife as many animals were run over by vehicles at night.The Kerala government filed an appeal and the issue remains unresolved. Though there were proposals for elevated highways, it was also met with opposition.The people’s charter prepared by the Wayanad Nature Protection Group and Wayanad Farmers Collective stressed the need for sustainable development without harming the ecology of the high-range district.The conservation of Wayanad forest, from where 13 rivers originate, is important to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The rivers also serve the agriculture and drinking water needs of many parts of these states.The charter demanded that no more natural forests should be used for any non-forestry-purposes, proposed railway line through Wayanad should be reconsidered and existing roads and road transport facilities be strengthened , and tourism projects regulated.
