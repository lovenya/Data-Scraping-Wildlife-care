“These animals need specialised housing and diet to survive, if they are not returned home safely, they may not survive, the whole team at Symbio are extremely worried,” it said. 

“If you have any information, or know someone who can, please email or call the park, everything will be treated anonymously, all we want is the animals home safe.”
