The website - www.karnatakawildlifeboard.org - the first of its kind in the country (even the National Board for Wildlife chaired by the Prime Minister, does not have its own website) is developed by Microsoft Corporation and built on their Azure platform. Several photographers have generously donated their images for the development of the site.  

Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa and Minister for Forest C H Vijayashankar launched the portal at Vidhana Soudha on Tuesday.

The portal, a brainchild of SBW Vice-Chairman Anil Kumble, has details of all the protected areas in the State, wildlife laws, details of Forest staff who have shown exemplary courage in saving wildlife, importance of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the State etc.  The website hosts a forum where any member of the public can express his/her opinions, provide suggestions and start discussion groups on national parks or wildlife sanctuaries in the State. 

The State Board for Wildlife is a statutory body setup under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 to advise the State Government on matters related to wildlife conservation, selection and management of protected areas.ADVERTISEMENT
