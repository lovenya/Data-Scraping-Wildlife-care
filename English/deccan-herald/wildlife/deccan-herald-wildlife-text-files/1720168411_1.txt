Sidda, the injured wild elephant at Manchanabele dam, is feeling comfortable inside the improvised structure constructed exclusively for him by the Madras Engineer Group (MEG).

ADVERTISEMENTDay two inside the structure was smooth and the wildlife vet treating him said that he is learning to relax and sleep with the harness. He was even found snoring for a short while on the first day.

Dr Arun A Sha, the vet treating him, said, “Although the swelling and the puss emitting from his right foreleg continues, we want him to first relax inside the structure and then create a separate platform for the leg to facilitate treatment.” 

Sidda has been drawing public attention ever since he was found at the Manchanabele dam 60 days ago. He fell into a trench and injured himself on 29 August in Kollur village and was driven by the forest guards for nearly 15 km with an injured leg. He is under treatment since October 21.
