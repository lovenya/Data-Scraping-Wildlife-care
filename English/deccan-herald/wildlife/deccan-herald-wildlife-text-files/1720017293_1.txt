The main reason for such a rich diversity of life is the sheer variety of habitats that are found in the State.
Evergreen forests, moist and dry deciduous forests, dry scrub and grasslands are all found here. Evergreen forests are found on the Western Ghats alongside the shola-grassland ecosystem. Dry scrub and grasslands occur in the drier parts of the State. 
Reservoirs, irrigation tanks, mangroves, and other wetland ecosystems also accommodate an abundant variety of wildlife. Since each of the habitats supports its own set of flora and fauna, the diversity comes as no surprise. Of the 16,000 species of flowering plants that are found in the country, about 3,750 species are found in Karnataka.  Trees, which are the source of many forest products, also grow  in abundance here. Besides, there are many species of orchids. Their size, shape and colour are enchanting. Insectivorous plants, like the sundew, can also be seen in suitable habitats. Many plants, which grow here naturally, are used for medicinal purposes.

 The word ‘wildlife’ normally conjures up images of elephants, tigers, lions and such large animals only. The lower life forms are normally ignored and very scant attention is paid to the smaller animals that live here.

In Karnataka, we have a very good representation of not only the large animals but also the small ones. Many of these animals have been declared endangered or ‘under threat’. Wildlife sanctuaries and national parks have been created for the protection of wildlife in their natural abode. Bandipur National Park was one of the first reserves in India and among the first nine Project Tiger reserves that was declared when the programme was launched in 1973. Until recently, Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary was  known for its gaurs, while the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary, which has a wide variety of habitats, supports a diversity of life forms. 

More than 500 species of birds have been recorded in Karnataka. This includes both resident and migratory birds. One of the most beautiful bird sanctuaries of the country, Ranganthittu, is located in Karnataka. Sanctuaries like Gudavi and Mandagadde also host nesting water birds. Karnataka is fortunate in having the endangered Spotbilled Pelican breeding alongside the Painted Stork at Kokkarebellur. All these sanctuaries, however, support mainly waterbirds when they congregate during their breeding season.  

A variety of reptiles and amphibians are found on the Western Ghats. The endangered King Cobra and the Indian Rock Python, which are giants among Indian snakes, are found here besides many other species of snakes, lizards, tortoises and turtles. The Marsh Crocodile can be seen in some river systems in the State. Several species of amphibians of over 250 species found in India have their home in Karnataka.

Insects, spiders and other related organisms abound in the wilderness. The most attractive and visible among them are butterflies. About 325 species of these beautiful creatures have been recorded in Karnataka. The largest Indian butterfly, the Common Birdwing, with a wingspan of 19cm, and the tiny Grass Jewel, with a wingspan of 1.5cm, are both found here. One of the large moths, the Atlas Moth, also lives here.

These wildlife treasures can be spotted by visiting sanctuaries and national parks. And what better time to learn and have fun than a weekend? But do remember, a visit to some of these places may require permission from the Forest Department.

To make the most out of a trip to the wilderness, it will be useful to do a bit of homework 
about the place, the best season to visit and what to expect. Do not go with too many expectations because nature has its own way. It would be useful to carry a hat/cap and wear light cotton clothes — preferably dull coloured. Be sure to drink adequate water. These little things can make your visit enjoyable.ADVERTISEMENT
