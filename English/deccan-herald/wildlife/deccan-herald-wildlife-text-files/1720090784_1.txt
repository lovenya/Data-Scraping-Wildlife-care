There was a marked decline in submissions from Tamil Nadu compared to last year.GBBC Karnataka coordinator Deepa Mohan said there was a rise in the number of participants as well as a marked improvement in the skills of the existing ones. "There was no major surprise sighting during the four-day exercise. However, the participation was encouraging," she added.The GBBC aims to understand the status of birds, including how birds are distributed across the country and how they are affected by changes in weather. The data will also help understand changes in migration patterns. The final report, likely to come out in April, is expected to update the numbers further.Though Lesser White-Fronted Goose, classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN, was sighted in Hadinaru Kere near Nanjangud, it has not been counted as part of the GBBC as the sighting took place before the exercise.
