“I am shocked and distressed by the callous exploitation by unscrupulous poachers of the natural disaster of floods and of helpless animals fleeing to find safe shelter,” she said.

Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, who returned from Japan on Thursday, told reporters here that the state government would recommend to the Centre for a CBI inquiry into the killing of rhinos by poachers during the past three years.

He also announced cash reward of Rs 5 lakh to anyone providing information about the poachers.

KNP director Sanjay Bora said, “Poachers killed one female rhino at Dolamara range along the Karbi hills and removed its horn, considered an aphrodisiac and also used in traditional medicine.”

“A male rhino, who had strayed from the flooded park, was found shot inside Jagadamba tea estate bordering Bagori range of the Park with its horn removed,” he said, adding,  “The animal is struggling for its life and a veterinary team has rushed to the spot to treat it.” Another female rhino left bleeding on Wednesday by poachers, who shot it, sawed off its horn and cut off a part of its right ear, died on Thursday.

The carcass of another rhino with its horn removed was found at the Kaziranga National Park. Forest Minister Rakibul Hussain told reporters here that Army personnel would be deployed in the fringe areas of KNP to prevent poachers from escaping after committing the crime.
