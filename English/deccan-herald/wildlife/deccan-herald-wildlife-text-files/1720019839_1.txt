While the Belur and Halebeedu temples with its beautiful sculptures attract hordes of tourists, Bhagwan Mahaveerâ€™s monolithic statue at Shravanabelagola is world famous. Apart from these, the district has more pilgrim centres that has historical importance.

 Though more importance is being given to the temples with historical background and abundant sculptures, there are also much opportunities for developing mythological tourism, Natural study tourism, wildlife tourism, adventure sports and archaeological study and many others. 

The other states which has even one such opportunities do not let it go and develop it into a major tourism attraction. But, the district which is having such good scope in developing tourism is neglecting to make use of it.

While, only a very few places have been declared as tourism spots, many others are being neglected. Moreover, the existing tourism centres too lack basic amenities like drinking water, good roads and lodging facilities.

The Hassan district administration and Tourism Development Committee have taken steps to identify tourism spots in the district and is preparing a report with the help of UNESCO. 

But, the failure of the government to provide suitable funds has resulted in tourism development taking a back seat.

Tourism day celebrations should not be limited on a single day celebrations but steps should be taken to make use of our tourism centres and develop tourism industry. 

This would help in developing the locals and also earn money to the government exchequer.
