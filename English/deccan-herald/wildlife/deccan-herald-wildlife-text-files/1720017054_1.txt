Chief Judicial Magistrate Kunwar Amanendra Singh also slapped a fine of Rs 10,000 on Vijay Pal yesterday after finding him guilty of violating the permissible speed limit of 30 km per hour in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries which led to the accident in September 1998, prosecution counsel S D Pant said.

This is the first such case in the country when a train driver has been convicted of driving train at a much faster speed than the permissible limit and killing wild animals, Pant claimed. Several wild animals are injured or killed every year after being hit by trains on the railway tracks that pass through national parks and wildlife sanctuaries of the country, he added.

Three elephants including a calf were killed after being hit by Janta Express driven by Pal when they were crossing Dehradun-Haridwar railway track in Kansaro range of the park. The prosecution had argued that Vijay Pal was not only driving the train at a speed of 60-70 km per hour but also did not apply breaks despite seeing elephants on the track.ADVERTISEMENT
