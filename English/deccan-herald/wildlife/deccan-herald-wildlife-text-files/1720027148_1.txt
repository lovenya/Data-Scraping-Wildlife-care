Butterflies of varied sizes and hues welcome you once you set foot in the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary on the Western Ghats in Kerala as over 107 species of the winged beauties make this evergreen forest their safe abode.

ADVERTISEMENTA survey conducted in the sanctuary by a team of biologists led by Unnikrishnan Pullickal assesses that these species will constitute around 32 per cent of the total butterflies in the Western Ghats.

After the completion of the three-day survey initiated by the state forest department, the total number of butterfly species found in the sanctuary was recorded at 76. The suitable habitats, host plants and least human intervention are believed to be the reasons why the area is a safe haven for butterflies.  

Some of the prominent endemic species found in the sanctuary are: Malabar Banded Swallowtail, Malabar Tree Nymph, Hampson’s Hedge Hopper, Malabar Rose, Glad Eye Bushbrown and Southern Birdwing.

To their surprise, the biologists also found that the sanctuary hosts the largest population of Hampson’s Hedge Blues (Acytolepis lilacea) butterfly, which is endangered and rarely found in other areas.

They also found the presence of critically endangered Nilgiri Tiger (Parantican nilgiriensis). Common Tinsel, common in Northern parts but rare in the Western Ghats was also found.
The survey was held on November 15, 16 and 17 and the second phase of the survey will be held in March next year.
