Black panther Minchulli, the centre of attraction for tourists at the Tyavarekoppa zoo-cum-safari near here a few years ago, may not be available for public viewing permanently. 

It has been kept in an isolated enclosure as it is suffering from Alopecia disease, a condition of hair loss, to ensure the remaining leopards are not affected and they do not attack ‘Minchulli’ as it now looks different. According to veterinarian Vinay S (Shivamogga wildlife circle), Minchulli was afflicted with Alopecia for the first time in 2015. 

It is said to be the lone panther in the state’s zoos. He, along with government veterinary college professor Sundaresh, treated the panther for months together. There was improvement. But Alopecia recurs twice a year. He said immunity in a black leopard is less than a leopard. Tests have been conducted to know the condition of vital organs of the panther.

Fortunately, the vital organs are not affected. So, there is no threat to its life. But it cannot mingle with its mother Kritika, who gave birth to this rare leopard in 2012 and other companions. At present, nutricoat advance tonic and nutrigen tablet are being given to it along with food. Generally, leopards consume food at night and not during the day. 

Rajesh, a visitor, told DH, “we are disappointed that Minchulli is not kept for public viewing. We were told that it is suffering from some disease.” 

The zoo is home to 350 animals - 185 mammals, 115 birds of various species and five reptiles. There are 21 leopards, including Minchulli, in the zoo. There are seven tigers - five male, two female. There are only two lions in the zoo-cum-safari. Efforts are on to bring two pairs of lions from Bannerghatta national park, Bengaluru.
