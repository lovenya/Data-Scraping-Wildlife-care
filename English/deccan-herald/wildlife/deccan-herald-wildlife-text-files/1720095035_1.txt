The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests has sought details from Karnataka Government about mitigation measures for the condition of forests and wild animals due to the implementation of the Kalasa Nala diversion scheme in the Mahadayi project.ADVERTISEMENTThe Ministry in its letter to Additional Chief Secretary to Forest and Ecology in Karnataka said that “since the project area is close to the wildlife sanctuary and eco-sensitive zone, specific recommendation and mitigation measures from Chief Wildlife Warden of Karnataka Forest Department may be provided.”The Ministry, which reviewed the latest proposal on the Mahadayi project submitted by the state government on getting green clearances, also suggested the state to explore the possibility of laying underground transmission lines instead of overhead to minimise the requirement of forest land/tree cutting. The Ministry also asked the state about the details of alternative land for afforestation if forest land diversion allowed for the project. The Ministry also asked the state whether it wanted to pursue its previous proposal about the project.The state government last year submitted a revised proposal on the Mahadayi project which involved diversion of Mahadayi river water through Kalasa and Bhandura Nala.
