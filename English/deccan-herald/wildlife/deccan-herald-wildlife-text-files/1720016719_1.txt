These students were apparently of great help to the doctors at BBP in bringing eight affected tigers back from the jaws of the death.

Considering the lack of veterinary staff in the zoos, the Forest Department had requested the Karnataka Veterinary Animal and Fisheries Sciences University to depute the MWVSc students. The first batch students, including Hemalatha, Pradeep, Vinay, Prashanth and Kiran of the full fledged wildlife veterinary institute were sent to the park to assist the doctors looking after the animals infected with Salmonella, round the clock.

“They were of great use during the crisis. We are really happy about them,” said B K Singh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) and Chief Wildlife Warden. “They worked round the clock for at least 15 days till the crisis was resolved,” as Milo tago, Executive Director, BBP recalled.

As Dr M Narayana Bhat, Director, Institute of Wildlife Veterinary Research, Kudige, put it, the students offered their help in various kinds of treaments and monitoring, and in conducting different kinds of examinations on the animals. Recognising their service, the State Forest Department honoured the students during the wildlife week in October.

The Zoo has only two doctors and the entire forest department just five doctors. However the Institute of Animal health and Veterinary Biologicals has now suggested to increase the number of medical staff to 12. Until further reinforcements arrive, the students will be deputed to the zoo as part of their curriculum.ADVERTISEMENT
