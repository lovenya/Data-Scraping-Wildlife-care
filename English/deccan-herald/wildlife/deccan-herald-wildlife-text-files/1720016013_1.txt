Before injuring the farmer, the elephants pulled down the shed where he was sleeping, police sources said.

The 21 year-old farmer has been admitted to government hospital and was "recovering", they said. Range Forest Officer Venugopal said it was the same herd which trampled two farmers to death near Tattekere-Chudahalli area in the same forest range yesterday.

"A small pathway of about five kilometres in the forest between Chudahalli and Kaniveshivapura villages and Tattekere area, which is an easy pathway for villagers, is on the elephant track and can be dangerous when herd is approaching", he said.

Solar fencing

Venugopal said Forest Department had already dug an trench in the area to combat the pachyderm menace and would soon take up solar fencing for the villages of Chudahalli and Kaniveshivapura.ADVERTISEMENT
