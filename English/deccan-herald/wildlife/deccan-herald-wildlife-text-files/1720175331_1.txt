Environmentalists in Dakshina Kannada district have urged government to create a separate corridor for King Cobra, endemic to Western Ghats and facing extinction.ADVERTISEMENTNational Environment Care Federation (NECF) Secretary Shashidhar Shetty who has submitted a representation to Principal Secretary and PCCF (Wildlife) C Jayaram in this regard said that the encroachment of forest, destruction of river sources inside the forest had threatened the existence of King Cobra in Western Ghats. The indiscriminate dumping of plastic waste, liquor bottles by the trekkers during trekking in Western Ghats had pushed King cobra nearly to extinction.The excessive use of fertilises in agricultural and horticultural crops in Western Ghats range and in Malnad, the killing of king cobra in Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru also had resulted in the rapid decline of their numbers in state.Usually King cobras prey on rabbits, “Barinka” and other wild animals including rats. But the dwindling number of such animals had triggered a food crisis in the forest for King Cobra. The felling of huge trees have also destroyed the natural habitat of the King Cobra, he said in a representation.Shetty said that the use of earth movers inside the forest, mining and human interference had disturbed the natural habitat of King Cobra.On the lines of Elephant and Tiger corridor, there is a need to develop a corridor for King Cobra, listed as ‘Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2010.’  The denuding of forest is affecting the habitation of King cobra.“An exclusive corridor will help in in conserving the species of King Cobra. The King Cobra corridor should be implemented as it will create awareness on wildlife act among the people,” he stressed.NECF also forwarded the representations to PCCF Punathi Sridhar, Chief Secretary of Government, Forest minister, Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition in Assembly.
