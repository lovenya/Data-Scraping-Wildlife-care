The meeting was marred by commotion as the Corporators of the BJP, the Congress and others had heated arguments over shortage of water and statement issued by the Mayor and Deputy Speaker on availability of water. 

The BJP corporators demanded an answer from the Mayor as what measures have been taken to solve the water crisis. 

The commotion all started when the BJP corporators said that there was no acute shortage of water in the last four years. “The BJP was able to supply water for 24 hours in a day. However, the water crisis has cropped up all of a sudden when Banu became Mayor.” 

To which Mayor said that the meeting convened by her to discuss on water issues was not attended by the BJP members. 

Corporator Naveen D’Souza said that the work on new vented dam has not seen any progress. Why the BJP corporators failed to get funds from the government to complete the dam. 

Shashidhar Hegde said “if we fail to increase the storage capacity, Mangalore will face acute shortage of water in the future as well.” 

Madhukiran said that there is a need to clean unused wells in the City Corporation limits. 
Commissioner Dr Harish said the inflow of water to the dam has reduced drastically owing to lack of rainfall in the catchment areas of river Nethravati. Normally, the catchment areas were receiving rainfall in the month of March. 

The water storage level at Thumbe dam is decreasing alarmingly. With the inflow of water reaching the zero level,  the water level stood at 9.10 feet as against full storage capacity of 13 feet, thus forcing Mangalore City Corporation to take preventive measures to avoid any acute shortage. 

“We are monitoring the situation. With the Corporation authorities opening two bottom valves of MRPL weir, the water level at the Thumbe vented dam, the major source of drinking water to the city, is rising. The MRPL has been asked to use only 2.5 MGD water from its dam.
 
The MCC has already started rationing water. Instead of 24 hours lifting of water, we are pumping water for 18 hours. As a result, the hilly regions are not enough getting water with the same speed.” 

Water from Lakhya dam

When Shanker Bhat raised the issue of drawing water from Lakhya dam, Commissioner said that the issue of drawing water from Lakhya dam has been submitted to the government. After obtaining permission from the government, measure will be initiated.

He said as per Wildlife Act, the water from the dam should not be utilised for industrial purpose. So the MCC had impleaded in a petition before the court with regard to drawing water from Lakhya dam. 

In the beginning, the KIOCL had sought 4 MGD water from the dam for its use. However, the MCC had rejected their application, as it would amount to serious problem in the court. However, the KIOCL has communicated to the MCC to draw water without any condition recently. 

Commotion on budget

The meeting also saw commotion on budget proceedings of the MCC, on Friday.
It all started with Shnaker Bhat objected to Mayor presiding over the meeting and approving the budget with amendments. There was commotion nearly for 25 minutes. 

The BJP demanded an answer from the Commissioner on whether the majority has any value in a democratic set up. Shanker Bhat said “as per Section 168 of the Karnataka Municipal Council Act, budget can not be tabled by the Mayor. It has to be read out by the Standing Committee on Finance President.” Sudheer Shetty said that the BJP corporators are not against the budget. 

MCC Commissioner said as per Section 67 of the proceedings of meeting rules 1998 of KMC Act, the newly elected Mayor can address the first meeting. A detailed report on the proceedings of the budget meeting will be sent to the government, he added. 
Deputy Mayor Amithakala was present.
