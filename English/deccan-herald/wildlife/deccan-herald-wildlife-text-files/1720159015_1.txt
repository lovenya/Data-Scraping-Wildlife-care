Forest Minister Ramanath Rai has told the Assembly that the government can’t take up development of roads and culverts inside national parks and wildlife sanctuaries due to strict regulations. 

ADVERTISEMENTPermission of the National Board for Wildlife is a must to take up any development work in these protected areas, he said while replying to V Sunil Kumar (BJP) who sought to know why development of roads in wildlife sanctuaries have not been taken up.

On wild elephant menace in Sakleshpur in Hassan district, Rai said the department has already captured one of the two rogue elephants. Efforts are on to obtain the permission from the Centre to capture the other. The State government intends to capture all wild elephants that stray into human habitation and, provide relief to the affected people. It cannot be done without obtaining the permission, he added.

Many MLAs, including B R Patil (KJP) and Govind Karjol (BJP), complained that none of the ministers, except the law minister, and the departmental heads respond to letters issued by legislators seeking information on the government schemes and programmes.  Jayachandra assured the House that the government will make it compulsory for all the ministers and officials to respond immediately to the legislators’ letters.
