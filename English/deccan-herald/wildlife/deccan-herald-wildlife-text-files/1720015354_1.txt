ADVERTISEMENTTumkur district has tracts of forests with rare herbs. It is also home to some interesting species of wildlife. 

Among them is the slender loris. If you are a wildlife enthusiast, a wildlife photographer or an observer of nature, then you must visit the villages near Tumkur and spot these animals.  
The slender loris is at No 22 on the list of 100 Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered animal species worldwide. 

The places where the slender loris can be found in Tumkur district are Hebbur, Nagavalli, Honnudike, Ujjini forest area and some parts of Gubbi. “Clearing shrubs, electrocution (thanks to fallen live wires), road accidents and hunting are major threats for these unique creatures. 

“I am trying to develop awareness among the local people and they are responding positively,” says Gundappa, environmentalist and high school teacher, who is trying to save these animals in and around Nagavalli and many other villages.
