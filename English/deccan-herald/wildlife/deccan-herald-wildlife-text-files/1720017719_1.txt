According to the department sources, the accused were trying to sell the leopard skin in Virajpet. When the officers received the hint, Anechoukur Wildlife region’s RFO Ravindra Kumar, Forestor Hosamani, Kalaswami and Lingaraju went to the spot in disguise and nabbed the accused. 

RFO Ravindra Kumar has informed that accused might have killed the leopard two or three days back as the skin is still afresh. The accused have said that they purchased the skin from the absconding offender Ali. 

“We are trying to nab the absconding man Ali and more information can be obtained only after his arrest,” said Ravindra Kumar.
