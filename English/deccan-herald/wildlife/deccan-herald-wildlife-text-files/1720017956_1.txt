Manoranjan (22), Madusudan Behera's son works on a contractual payroll in the department and is nurturing the captive crocodiles including his father's killer. Behera worked as an ad-hoc employee in the forest department.

"My father used to feed the captive animals. After one of them killed him on April 24, 2000, forest department asked me to do what my father was doing. Since then, I have been doing the same. I was only 16 years then," Manoranjan said.

"I was left with no option but to accept it. I vividly remember the day when a male crocodile killed my father when he was feeding it with crab and fish," he said.

"He was also a contractual employee. The department paid our family Rs 10,000 ex-gratia to compensate," he said.

He said, "The forest department is gracious enough to erect my father's memorial." "His appointment was on daily wages done on compassionate grounds," Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, Divisional Forest Officer, Rajngar Mangrove (wildlife) forest division, said.ADVERTISEMENT
