The appellant, Kumar had moved the KAT after he was transferred from Bandipur on 8 September, 2009 to Doresanipallya in Bangalore. The KAT remanded the matter to Cadre Management Authority of State Government, which on 20 November, 2009 replied saying that the transfer is in the interest of public.

The KAT on 17 February dismissed the petition stating that the Cadre Management Authority has recorded stating that uncontrolled killing of wildlife has made the transfer necessary.

Mismanagement of forest

The KAT also said that the petitioner had caused loss to the government by mismanagement of forest wealth and his physique is also not suited for an active wildlife officerâ€™s post and there is no need for interfering with the transfer order.

Kumar had challenged this order in the High Court. During the hearing Government Counsel Veerappa submitted that the the local MLA had written to Chief Minister to transfer him stating that there is a threat to wildlife due to him and the Chief Minister had directed for his transfer in the public interest. The bench dismissed the petition.
