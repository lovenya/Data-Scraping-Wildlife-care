Electrocution due to lightning led to death of 18 wild elephants inside a forest in Assam's Nagaon district on May 13, Assam governmet on Thursday said while referring to an expert committee which investigated into the tragic incident. ADVERTISEMENT"From the reports of the expert committee, post-mortem reports and the reputed authorised government agencies like North East Space Application Centre, it can be concluded that cause of the death may not be attributed to retaliatory killing by poisoning or electrocution or any other deadly disease. It was caused by accidental electrocution by lightning that occured on May 12 with a strong negative lightning flash with a peak current of 39,000 Amperes," Assam environment and forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya told reporters here on Thursday.Bodies of 18 elephants including babies were found on a hill inside Kanduli proposed reserve forest in central Assam's Nagaon district on May 13, causing shock and speculation among wildlife lovers and conservationists. Although post-mortem report made public on May 14 suggested that lightning could be the cause of the death, some conservationists demanded a thorough probe suspecting foul play.The state government instituted an inquiry by a 10-member team comprising experts from forest department, college of veterinary science under Assam Agricultural University, WWF India, Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation based in Kaziranga, North Eastern Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Guwahati, beside others. "The autopsy report said the death of the elephants in the herd may not be attributed to any toxin or poison," said a statement issued by the forest department. It said the matter was also taken up with international experts and organisations with the investigation reports and photographs of the accident site. "Comments received from Dr Markus Hofmeyr, wildlife veterinarian, Director, Rhino Recovery Fund and Vivek Menon, Chair, Asian Elephant Specialist Group, IUCN also suggested that the cause of the death may be suspected to be lightning strike as such incidents are not uncommon," said the statement.
