Thousands of people, mostly Bengali-speaking Muslims, have been evicted so far.In September 2021, two persons were killed in police firing during an eviction drive in Sipajhar in Darrang district, according to officials.In one of the largest eviction drives, 2,099 hectare of the Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary in Sonitpur district was cleared in February, affecting about 12,800 people.In another eviction drive in the same area, one person was killed and three forest guards injured in July.Dismissing the opposition's criticism, CM Sarma has maintained that the eviction drive to clear government and forest land would continue as long as the BJP is in power in the state.
