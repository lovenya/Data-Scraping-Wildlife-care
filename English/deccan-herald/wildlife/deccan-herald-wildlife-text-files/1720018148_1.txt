Replying to a question by Ramalinga Reddy (Congress), the minister said the entry fees had to be hiked because the prices of petrol and diesel had increased, pushing up the maintenance costs. 

There are five national parks and 23 sanctuaries in the State. The entry fee for Bandipur, Nagarahole, Anshi, Bannerghatta and Kudremukh national parks and Dandeli, Bhadra, Someshwara, Mookambika, Brahmagiri, Pushpagiri, Talacauvery, BRT and Cauvery wildlife sanctuaries has been increased from Rs 60 to Rs 200 per person (Indian) with effect from February 1. For foreigners, it is Rs 1,000, up from Rs 200. 

For safaris in department jeeps or vehicles, each trip will cost Rs 200, up from Rs 65. 

This is in addition to the entry fee for every individual. Boat rides in Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary will now cost Rs 50 a person, up from Rs 25. The fee is Rs 300 for foreigners. This is in addition to the entry fees. 

Rents for rooms, cottages, tents and dormitories at the national parks and sanctuaries will also cost more. For Indians, the rents used to be in the range of Rs 350 to 650 and now it is Rs 1,000. 

The vehicle parking fees have been doubled. Guide fees have also been hiked in the national parks and sanctuaries.
