Wildlife activists have demanded the intervention of Deputy Commissioner G Satyavati to return 17 acres of land at Kemmannugundi to its original owner, the Forest department. The said land is now split between the departments of Horticulture and PWD.

The land was given to Horticulture and PWD on contract basis way back in the year 1991-92. As it is situated in Bhadra Reserve Forest, commercial activities are prohibited here. However, the Horticulture department has been taking up construction works in the name of tourism, said D V Girish from Bhadra Wildife Conservation Trust, Sridev Hulikere from Wildcat-C and wildlife activist G Veeresh.

What makes the forest area unique is that it comes under Tanigebailu range and is declared as critical core tiger habitat. It has been also identified as ‘Mysuru Elephant Reserve Extention Buffer Area’ in 2015. It is the habitat of rare and endangered animals. 

In the name of tourism, Horticulture department has been indulging in illegal activities like taking up construction works without taking any prior permission from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, National Tiger Conservation Authority or even state-level Bhadra Tiger Reserve authorities.
