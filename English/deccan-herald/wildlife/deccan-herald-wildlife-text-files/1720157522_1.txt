Quenching thirst of Bandipur’s wildlife 

ADVERTISEMENTBandipur’s water bodies, which had gone dry owing to one of the worst droughts the region is facing, are now being resurrected. The Forest Department has now started supplying water to these tanks from wells. This has come as a great boon for the forest region’s wildlife.

The tanks in the forest area had not seen  such a scenario in the last 20 years. 
While species such as elephants are known to migrate to Kabini , other animals such as deer don’t migrate. In an effort to provide water to such wildlife, the Forest Department installed artificial tanks. But, when they did not succeed in drawing animals to these tanks, they decided to take up the new experiment. The Department identified many tanks that were drying up, and decided to supply water to them by way of bore wells.
Now, every day, a tanker with a 17,000-litre capacity and another tanker with a 6,000-litre capacity supplies water to tanks such as Tavaraghatta, Anekatte, Somayyanakatte, Athanikatte, etc. This scheme has worked well for the wildlife in the region.
