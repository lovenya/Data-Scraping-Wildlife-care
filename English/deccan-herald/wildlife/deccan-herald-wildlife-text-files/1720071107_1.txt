Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday told the Legislative Assembly that neighbouring Karnataka has diverted the Mahadayi river water, due to which its flow in the state has taken a hit.ADVERTISEMENTHe was speaking during a debate on the motion of thanks to Governor Satya Pal Malik for his address.Goa and Karnataka are locked in a dispute over sharing of the Mahadayi river water. Goa is strongly opposing the Kalasa Banduri project proposed to be built by Karnataka on the river, which is aimed at providing drinking water to three north Karnataka districts by diverting the Mahadayi water into the Malaprabha river.Speaking in the House, Sawant said that the flow of Mahadayi river has reduced due to the diversion of water by Karnataka."I am admitting that they (Karnataka) have diverted the water. We have brought it to the notice of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change," he said.The Goa government has explained to the Centre that the water which flows into the state is "not wasted"."We have told them that the perennial flow of water is necessary for Goa's wildlife," he said.Sawant said that his government was serious on the issue of Mahadayi."Mahadayi is more than a mother to me. We have not compromised anywhere on the issue. I have been associated with the Mahadayi agitation since 2000," the chief minister said.He said the issue would be fought before the Supreme Court, where special leave petition has been filed by the state.
