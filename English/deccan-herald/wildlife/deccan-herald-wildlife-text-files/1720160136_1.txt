Hirebenkal is a remote village, ten km from Gangavathi town in Koppal district. It is mainly known for its pre-megalithic and neolithic and megalithic sites which have been declared as protected monuments by the ASI in 1955. ADVERTISEMENTAtop the Hirebenkal’s Elu Gudda (Seven Rocks) there are hundreds of dolmens – three dimensional cists (an ancient coffin or burial chamber made from stone or a hollowed tree), spread over acres of this hilly terrain.The Iron Age cemetery has more that 1,000 mausoleum-like small rock shelters built of upright slabs topped by cap stones. Archaeologically dated between 800 BC and 200 BC the dolmens (which are about six to eight feet high flat-roofed rock shelters) are fully or partially buried tombs most of which are located uphill. 

An old quarry site has also been discoverednearby which probably was the source for building materials of the type found in Hirebenkal monuments.

They are easily distinguishable by their artistically done red ochre rock paintings depicting people, domestic animals, birds and wildlife. From Hospet, Hirebenkal is about one hour journey on Gangavathi-Koppal state highway. The village is also approachable from the towns of Gangavathi and Koppal by the state highway. 

The nearest railway station to the site is Hospet. The ruins of Hampi are about 50 km away.The Archaeological Survey of India has sought world heritage status to Hirebenkal’s archaeological site along with the heritage cluster of Aihole, Badami and Mahakuta in Bagalkot district.
