Very few know that Abhay Deol is an animal lover and has been one since his childhood. Reveals Abhay,  “At my parent’s house, there are three dogs. I’ve grown up with these four-legged creatures all my life.”

We come to hear that Abhay feels so strongly for his dogs, that he has been encouraged to work harder for the cause of wildlife. 

Says Abhay, “A decade down the line, I don’t want to sit back and think that I didn’t do anything to stop disasters like the extinction of certain species. I’d rather point a finger at myself than others.”

Playing it by ear

Sajid Nadiadwala and Sajid Khan’s Housefull, starring Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Lara Dutta, Randhir Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh, Arjun Rampal, Boman Irani and Jiah Khan, seems to have one funny incident after another happening on the sets. This time around, Jiah Khan ended up holding veteran actor Randhir Kapoor’s ear and got the entire set in splits. 

Reveals a source, “Jiah Khan plays Randhir Kapoor’s daughter in the film and for a particular sequence, Sajid told her to apologise to Randhir Kapoor and hold her ears and ask for forgiveness. But due to some misunderstanding, she thought she had to hold Randhirji’s ears.” Adds the source, “Everyone on the set started laughing at her goof-up and Randhir Kapoor himself was very amused by the incident.”
