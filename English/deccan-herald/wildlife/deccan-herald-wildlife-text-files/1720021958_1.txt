The CBI today doubled the cash reward of Rs five lakh to Rs 10 lakh for information on the murder of RTI activist Shehla Masood who was shot dead outside her house in Bhopal in August last year.

ADVERTISEMENTCBI had registered a case against unnamed persons in connection with the incident on September 3 last year but it remains clueless about the mystery shrouding the murder prompting it to increase the reward money, CBI sources said.

"Any credible information regarding the murder of Shehla Masood murder can be shared on 0425600927, 09425001643 and 09425661632," CBI spokesperson said here.

Shehla was shot dead when she was going towards her car outside her residence in posh Koh-e-Fiza locality in Bhopal on August 16.

A team of AIIMS experts led by Forensic Scientist T D Dogra arrived in Bhopal on Thursday to give their insights on this complex case. The agency has also questioned some persons with regards to the case.

The case was transferred to the CBI as Madhya Pradesh Police could not figure out the motive behind the murder but suspected she was eliminated by some powerful persons against whom she had filed RTI applications.

Shehla had earlier gone on a hunger strike in Bhopal in support of Anna Hazare's cause. She was also involved in other causes, including wildlife conservation.
