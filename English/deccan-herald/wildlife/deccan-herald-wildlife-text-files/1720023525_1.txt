Coorg Wildlife Society members alleged that environment, democracy and freedom have suffered a set back in Kodagu because of the elected representatives and timber lobby. 

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing a press meet, Vice-President Col (retd) Muthanna said that “the environmentalists are campaigning for conserving the environment in Kodagu. However, elected representatives are levelling false allegations and carrying out false propaganda against the environmentalists. In fact, efforts are made to raise voice against us. Assembly Speaker K G Bopaiah is involved in levelling false allegations against us.”

“On the issue related to Kadamakkal road, we were projected as anti-development. The road will be helpful only for the rubber planters and not for the villagers. As the issue is before the court, I will not divulge into the issue,” he said.  

Bopaiah and MLA M P Appacchu Ranjan pressurised the police to file false case against Kaveri Sene convenor Ravi Chengappa when he decided to clean Bhagamandala-Talacauvery, he alleged. “Illegal sand mining, illegal quarry and smuggling of timber are being carried out unabated in the district. However, there is no one to question it,” he said. 

Society President Duleep Nanjappa said “Zilla Panchayat President Ravi Kushalappa had urged the people to pelt stones at environmentalists recently in a programme. What crime we have committed?” he asked. 

Many had claimed that the environmentalists get foreign funds. One should not level any allegations without documents to prove it, he said.
