The Khanapur region of Belagavi district is known for its dense forest and natural water resources. The region, which is situated on the foothills of Western Ghats, is home to a rich diversity of wildlife, particularly birds.

ADVERTISEMENTCome winter, birders from near and far come to the place to take a glimpse of common and rare bird species.

One such place that attracts visitors is the banks of River Pandra, which originates in Ramanagara in Joida taluk and flows through Khanapur. Here one can see birds perching on  rocks and tree branches.

“Grains and pulses grown in the fields provide food for these birds. Moreover, the place is ideal for their breeding,” explains forest official Girish. These winter visitors make birdwatching a joyful experience.

Sometimes, one could also get a chance to view wild animals on the fringes of the forest. Khanapur is close to Karwar, Belagavi and Dharwad and makes for a good one-day trip.
