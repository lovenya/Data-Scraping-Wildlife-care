The Zoo Authority of Karnataka, announced on Thursday that preparations were in full swing to open the country’s first conservation and breeding centre for wild buffaloes near Mysore.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking at the valedictory of a function as part of the 58th Wildlife Week, M Nanjundaswamy, chairperson of the zoo authority said that tenders have been cleared to build a compound around 113 acres of green space at Koorgalli village — where the new buffalo centre is due to come up.

Nanjundaswamy said that an alarming decline in the numbers of the animal had prompted the government to conceive a conservation centre. 

“Like many other animals in the country, wild buffaloes are also endangered. As Karnataka is one of the main habitats for these animals in the country, The park will go a long way to help conserve them,” he said and added that 40 buffaloes from Mysore Zoo and many others in captive forests across the State, will be housed at the upcoming centre. 

A K Varma, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) said that increasing urbanisation was leading to increased conflicts between man and animal. He added that there was an urgent need to spread awareness to tackle the problem. 

“During the previous years, our focus was on crime against wild animals, like poaching, which has come down now. On the other hand, the man-animal conflict has become serious. We need to do a introspection at this stage and work towards the formula of co-existence,” he said.

According to Nanjundaswamy, there are a total of eight zoological parks in the State, including the one at Bannerghatta near Bangalore.
