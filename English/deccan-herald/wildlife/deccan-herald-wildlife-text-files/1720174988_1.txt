He was arrested on Sunday and will be produced in a court," Peta India's Lead Emergency Response Co-ordinator, Meet Ashar said, in a statement on Monday."We commend the Superintendent of Police, the Deputy Commissioner, and the divisional forest officer for sending out a strong message that such cruelty will not be tolerated.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has found that a history of animal abuse is one of the traits that regularly appears in the records of serial rapists and murderers, it added.
