Taking a cue from Einstein, the Mysore Science Centre (MSC) is assisting students from rural areas discover their talents in science and also to try their hand at innovation.

Started in 1987 jointly by Ha Ma Nayak, Prof J R Lakshman Rao, Dr A P Bhashyam, Prof M H Dhananjaya, Engineer Balasubramaniam, Prof A V Govind Rao and Sethurao, the centre started as ‘Vignani Kendra’ to improve awareness about science in students from rural areas. Later, the ‘Vignani Kendra’ became a trust in 1996 and from then onwards has strove by providing a platform for young innovators.

With nearly 30-40 lectures being held every year in the districts of Mysore and 

Chamarajanagar, the Science Centre also holds science exhibitions and various activities such as quiz, drawing and interaction programmes.

Speaking to City Herald, MSC Director N Shekar said that science model exhibitions are held from the taluk-level to the state-level for the rural students based on a particular theme. For example, in the present year ‘land resources’ has been taken as a theme and many students from across the state exhibited their models at Regional Institute of Education (RIE).

During the previous years, themes included studies on depletion of water level and measures to tackle it, improving sanitation, causes and ways to reduce pollution and effect of floods.

Shekar said that with Chamarajanagar being seismically active and an earthquake prone area,  students were trained on disaster management to mitigate the effects in case of an eventuality.

The latest addition includes ‘Scientist - Student’ direct interaction programme that allows rural students to know about emerging areas of technology and pose their queries to eminent scientists. Recently, an interaction programme involving a scientist from Forensic Scientific Laboratory explaining the advantages of ‘DNA Fingerprinting’ was held in the city. 

Shekar said that during the previous year, an interaction programme to popularise chemistry was also held. In order to make the lecture interesting, the chemical reactions caused in the human body was discussed during the programme. 

While an interaction on nanotechnology gave students information on emerging technological areas, a session on how tiger census is conducted ensured that the pupils gave a thought about conservation of wildlife as well.

Apart from these activities, every year a rally is held for 30 days in rural areas. MSC Co-ordinator R Srinivasan said that around 10,000 children take part in the rally each year. This apart, planting of saplings are also undertaken. MSC is not only about science,but also about protecting the environment. 

Eighth standard students are involved in planting saplings so that they can take care of the plants for atleast two years during which it would have become self-sufficient. 

Furthermore, he said that the centre aims to eliminate superstitions prevailing in the society and also improve consumer awareness about food adulteration. He said that around professors and doctors visit around 25-30 schools every year and inform students about the myths that are being used by ‘godmen’ to misguide the society. 

However, the Shekar is concerned that neither the government is neglecting the initiative by denying it funds that are essential to conduct the programmes. 

While, Shekar is concerned that the denial of space for an office is a cause for concern, he bemoaned the callous nature of institutions in helping the centre, which is providing scientific knowledge to rural students.ADVERTISEMENT
