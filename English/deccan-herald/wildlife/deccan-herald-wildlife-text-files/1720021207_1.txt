Hence, we are trying to seek experts’ opinion to advance the restriction by two to three hours,” Forest Minister C P Yogeeshwara said at the valedictory function of 57th Wildlife Week here on Monday. 

Animals that venture out after sunset are at peril due to heavy traffic, he added.
Stressing on the need to rehabilitate tribals from reserve forest areas, Governor H R Bhardwaj who  was present at the function, urged the government to  allocate land to the displaced on a priority basis. 

Bhardwaj stated that encroachment and mining in forest area have threatened the wildlife and disrupted the tribals of life.

“All of us have contributed to the extinction of forest and wildlife. It is high time to realise our mistake and help protect the forests and reduce the man-animal conflict,” Bhardwaj said.
