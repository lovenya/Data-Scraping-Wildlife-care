Blackbucks, an endangered species found in Balipadar-Bhetanai area in Ganjam district of Odisha, seem to be migrating to newer areas, official sources said.

ADVERTISEMENTAt least two blackbucks were rescued by the villagers from various places of the district. One of them was found at Balipada and another at Babanapur near Aska.

“We have rescued a male blackbuck from Balipadar. The animal will be handed over to the Nandankanan zoo authority in Bhubaneswar,” said S S Mishra, divisional forest officer, Berhampur .

The blackbuck migrated towards Jagannath Prasad and Belaguntha areas in search of food and water as, some of the water bodies in their habitat dried up, sources said. 

The wildlife experts feared that five blackbucks reportedly died in a fortnight. “We have the information about the migration of the blackbuck. But we have no information about their death due to scarcity of water,” said divisional forest officer, Ghumusar South R.Ch Sethi.

Increase in population might be one of the causes for migration of blackbucks to newer areas, said an expert. The population of blackbuck in the area was counted at 2181 in the last census, conducted in July 2011. Their number was 551 in 1998, 786 in 2004, 1101 in 2006, sources said.

The blackbucks have been protected religiously by the local people for several generations. 

They believe the presence of blackbuck in the paddy fields brings prosperity to the village.
