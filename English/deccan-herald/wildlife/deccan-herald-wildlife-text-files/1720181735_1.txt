For some people, stimulants can cause unpleasant feelings like nervousness, nausea, and trouble sleeping."Some people like to use natural fat burners that make them feel more energetic and burn more calories. But if you are used to drinking a lot of coffee or other drinks with caffeine, you should check the label of your natural fat burner.

It does this by interfering with the hormone insulin and preventing your body from absorbing sugar from your blood. This makes your body use up more calories and fat.
