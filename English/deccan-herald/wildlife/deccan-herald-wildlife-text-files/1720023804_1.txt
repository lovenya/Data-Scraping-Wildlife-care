A group of wildlife enthusiasts staged a protest in the City, on Tuesday, against the officials’ laxity in controlling forest fire that ravaged the Nagarhole and Bandipur forest ranges, four days ago.

ADVERTISEMENTThey laid siege to the Forest Department. The protesters blamed the officers for not repairing a wireless system that had gone defunct since December. 

“A wireless system at the main centre in Nagarhole range had snapped due to some technical problems since December. Despite repeated reminders, it was never restored. Had the wireless network been repaired, it would have helped the Department in controlling the fire,” claimed Joseph Hoover, a wildlife expert. 
They criticised Principal Conservator of Forests, B K Singh for not making public news about the fire that is raging in the forest area.
