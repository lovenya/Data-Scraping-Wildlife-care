But, we found no trace of the leopard. We thought it might have left the area," Kumar said."After the latest incident, we have started finalising our draft proposal to declare the leopard as a man-eater. It will be sent to the chief wildlife warden for approval," he added.The forest department has also ordered three cages to capture the animal.Kumar said that villagers were not paying any heed to the forest department's advisory of not venturing out after sunset."We have warned villagers, particularly women and children, not to come out of their houses after the sunset as the leopard has been attacking during this time. If they need to go out, they should be accompanied by a group of men. We have been making this appeal since December 15," he said.
