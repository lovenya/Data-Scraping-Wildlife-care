At least 97 rescued star tortoises will soon return to their habitat in Koppal from Singapore.

These animals were smuggled to Singapore around six months ago. Customs officials in Singapore, however, seized and sent these endangered species to Animal Concerns and Research Education Society (Acres) there. 

Wildlife SOS and the Karnataka Forest Department are now making efforts to bring these quarantined animals back to their habitat. P Annur Reddy, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife), former PCCF B K Singh and Kartick Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS Co-Founder, visited Singapore last week to check the health of these tortoises.

The forest department has sent a request to the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) seeking clearance from the Singapore government to send the Indian star tortoises back to India. Director General of Foreign Trade has also been requested to look into the matter.

“We hope Cites will give its clearance at the earliest. By the end of this month, Singapore is likely to send the star tortoises back to India. On their return, these tortoises will be sent to Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) for at least six months to get acclimatised to the Indian environment. Their health and stress will be closely monitored. After clearance from the veterinarians, they will be released in their natural habitat in Koppal,” said a Wildlife SOS volunteer. 

Reddy said that of the 97 rescued tortoises, 85 will come in the first batch immediately and the rest are undergoing treatment and will be repatriated once they recover. ­
