In a gesture of support to wildlife conservation, Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI) employees volunteered at Wildlife SOS Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre in the city.ADVERTISEMENTAs part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, LTI employees recently visited the centre where the wildlife conservation NGO organised an employment engagement activity.The rescue centre houses over 70 rescued sloth bears amid the lush green and rocky terrain of the dry deciduous Bannerghatta Biological Park, the second largest in the country.The bears are prised away from dancing bear traders, poaching and human-animal conflict situations.The LTI team went on a tour of the centre and of the bear enclosures.They familiarised themselves with the green kitchen and the eco-friendly, on-site cooking for the resident bears.Dr Arun A Sha, director, Research and Veterinary Operations, shared the organisation's role in conservation of wildlife and caring for rehabilitated sloth bears.The L&T staff also engaged in volunteering activities such as building hammocks for bears, painting enclosure
fences, slicing fruits and assisting the keepers to feed the bears.Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said the NGO was grateful to Larsen and Toubro Infotech for their support."Our volunteering programme gives people an opportunity to work alongside animals and get satisfaction out of helping make a positive impact on their lives. Our objective is to give the animals a life of dignity and freedom in an environment as close to their natural habitat as possible," he said.
