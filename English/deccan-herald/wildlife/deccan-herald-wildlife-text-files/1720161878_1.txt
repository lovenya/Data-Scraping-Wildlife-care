Home Minister K J George, on Thursday, claimed that he had played no role in the appointment of his son Rana George as member of State Wildlife Board.

ADVERTISEMENTWhen his attention was drawn to comments about influencing his son’s nomination, the minister shot back for proff.

“My son has been interested in environment and wildlife since childhood. An avid wildlife photographer, he was nominated as honorary wildlife warden in Chikkmagalur District during the tenure of JD(S)-BJP government. He continued to remain in the post even after BJP government ascended power in 2008,” George averred.
