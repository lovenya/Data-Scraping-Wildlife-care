A five-day session of the state legislature will commence on Monday with Governor Vajubhai Vala addressing a joint sitting of the two Houses.

ADVERTISEMENTThe governor is scheduled to deliver his address at 11 am. The two Houses, which will sit separately after the governor’s address, will take up obituay references.

The two Houses will be later adjourned for the day as a mark of respect to former minister H S Mahadeva Prasad, who passed away last month. Prasad was a sitting member of the Legislative Assembly from the Gundlupet constituency in Chamarajanagar district.

The BJP is gearing up to put the government on the mat for failing to take up relief measures in 139 taluks reeling under severe drought. The party is also planning to vehemently seek the resignation of Small Scale Industries Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi following the Income Tax department unearthing Rs 113 crore of undisclosed assets purportedly belonging to him.

The JD(S) is planning to raise the  “large-scale” irregularities in the implementation of the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor project.

Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Jagadish Shettar said the legislature session should be held for at least 15 days to discuss various issues related to the state.

Shettar told journalists in Hubballi that the government is conducting the session for only five days as it fears that the Opposition will bring out the government’s failures.

He said that his party wants to discuss  deteriorating law and order in the state, the government’s inability to address the drought situation and the need for protecting the Kappatagudda wildlife sanctuary.
