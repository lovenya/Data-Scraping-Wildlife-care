To educate students and to safeguard forests, the ‘Chinnara Vanadarshana’ scheme has made its way in the budget with an allocation of Rs three crore.

ADVERTISEMENTPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) (Wildlife) Vinay Lutra said that under the scheme, class nine students from schools located around the reserves and national parks will be taken on a three-day tour to the forest, wherein children will be provided practical knowledge on conservation. 

The tour was undertaken on a pilot basis three months ago.Two new schemes - ‘Talukige Ondu Hasiru Grama’ and ‘Shala Vana’ - have also been introduced. 

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests G V Sugur said under the first scheme, a model village in each taluk will be developed with green renewable energy like solar and bio-gas and medicinal plants will be grown in the backyards of every home. Under the ‘Shala Vana,’ schoolchildren and local residents will be roped in to develop about three to five acres of forest land for afforestation in every taluk. 

To speed up rehabilitation and relocation of tribals, special cells will be created. 
Sugur said that presently rehabilitation was done through the Revenue department and the Forest department only assisted. But now a special team comprising Revenue and Forest department officials on deputation will be set up. 

They will value properties, identify land and provide basic facilities. Also, a grant of Rs two crore will be provided to the Environmental Management and Policy Research Institute in Bengaluru to prepare an action plan to mitigate climate change.
