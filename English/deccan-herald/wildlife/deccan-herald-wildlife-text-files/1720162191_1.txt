A police constable was mowed down by the sand mafia when he tried to stop a dumper carrying illegally mined sand from the Chambal river near a village in the wee hours on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENT“We have lodged a case under section 304 of IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the driver who fled from the spot,” Morena superintendent of police Navneet Bhasin said.

Constable Dharmendra Chouhan went to Louhgarh village under Noorabad police station limits along with a team late on Saturday night following a tip-off that some people involved in a loot incident were hiding there. He spotted a dumper parked on a roadside there and decided to check it, said Inspector General, Chambal Range, R S Meena.

The driver upon seeing the police tried to escape from the spot along with the dumper loaded with illegally mined sand, he said.

But, the 40-year-old constable, posted at Noorabad police station, clung onto its door on the driver’s side and tried to pull him down, he said.

The driver then started reversing the dumper at a great speed and then turned it towards the driving side. As a result, the vehicle fell into a ditch and overturned, trapping the constable under it resulting in his death. The dumper driver fled from the spot soon after the incident. A manhunt has been launched for the driver, Bhasin said, adding that forest department was asked to launch a prosecution under the Wildlife Protection Act for those responsible for illegal mining.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court banned sand mining in the river more than five years ago in response to a PIL, observing that it posed threat to gharials who lay eggs in the sand.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress’s chief spokesman K K Mishra said the entire state had become a capital of mining mafia under the patronage of the BJP government.
