One of the biggest fresh water islands in Asia, Majuli in Assam, faces a huge threat of man-elephant conflict due to terror unleashed by a huge herd of wild elephants. 

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to sources, for the past two days at least 200 wild elephants came down to the river island in the evening and started destroying crops and vegetables in Nayabazar along with 20 other adjacent villages while some damaged houses and properties forcing the villagers to flee .

Forest officials resorted to blank firing and bursting of fire crackers but didn’t cause much effect to the herd of wild elephants who have been frequently wrenching havoc in Majuli and adjacent areas over the past few years.  

Crucial Elephant corridors in Assam and a few across the country will see more conservation and protection activities as five renowned wildlife conservation NGOs – Elephant Family, International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), IUCN Netherlands, World Land Trust and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) have joined hands for organising a foreign fund raising campaign worth £20 million with a common goal under the umbrella of the Asian Elephant Alliance to secure the Jumbo corridors, on Wednesday in London.   

The Asian Elephant alliance aims to secure a safe passage for India’s elephants, which comprises approximately half of the world’s wild Asian elephant population and the fund raised will be used to secure the dwindling elephant corridors in Assam, particularly in and around the Kaziranga national Park, a Unesco World Heritage site.
