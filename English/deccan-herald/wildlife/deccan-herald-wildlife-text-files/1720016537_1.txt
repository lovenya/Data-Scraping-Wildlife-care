Police stated that the girl, Chaitra, had allegedly helped him financially by stealing her mother’s gold ornaments, for starting his business venture. Her world turned upside down, when her lover refused to return the money and started blackmailing her, using some of her photographs. 

According to the complaint filed at Koramangala police by Chaitra, a second year BCom student of Venkateshwara College in Madivala, her boyfriend Raju, a first year BCom student in the same college, was refusing to return her money.

According to the complaint, Chaitra knew Raju over the last two years. Raju had introduced himself as rich and hailing from Andhra Pradesh. 

The matter came to light when her parents came back and asked her about the missing ornaments. She confessed to her act and assured them about retrieving the amount from Raju. 

But she got a rude shock when Raju refused to return the money. “Instead of giving back the money, he threatened me for more money and told that he would put some of my photographs on the internet to damage my reputation,” she said. Koramangala police station Inspector G Nagaraj said Raju was never a student of the college. “We are looking for him,” he said.
