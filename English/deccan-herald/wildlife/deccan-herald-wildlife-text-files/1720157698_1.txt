The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday restrained Uttam Steels and Associates (Consortium) and Shiv Nadar University from any construction or reclaiming land in Dadri wetlands and its catchment area in Greater Noida.

ADVERTISEMENTA bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar directed the UP environment directorate, the real estate developer and the university not to carry out any construction or reclamation activity within 500 metres of the periphery of the highest water level of the wetland.

“We hereby restrain respondents three (directorate of environment, UP), six (Uttam Steels) and seven (Shiv Nadar) from raising any construction or reclaiming any land or in any way interfering with the wetlands as well as its catchment area,” the bench said, and listed the matter for hearing on September 24.

“They shall not carry on all the above activities within 500 m from the periphery of the highest water level in the wetland,” it said.

The NGT said with the ministry of environment and forests, State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and the UP government “shifting” to each other their responsibility regarding the area, the environment has become a victim of commercialisation.

“We are surprised to see the state of affairs prevailing in the MoEF, SIEAA and the UP forest department and its department of environment, which seem to be shifting the burden of their responsibility to the other, with the net result that the environment, wildlife and wetland are victims of commercialisation. Prima facie, this is what appears to us,” the bench said.

The tribunal’s order came on the plea of two UP-based environmentalists Akash Vashishtha and Vikrant Tongad, who said the Dadri wetlands, also called Bil Akbarpur wildlife habitat, are being destroyed due to activity of builders and others.
