The state government's firm stand on continuing with the night ban on movement of vehicles through the Bandipur Tiger Reserve was backed by Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTKerala failed to get any relief at an inter-state meeting held to discuss the issue of lifting the ban on National Highways (NHs) 212 and 67.At the end of the two-hour-long meeting, officials from the three states decided to maintain status quo. The meeting was held at the Karnataka Forest Department head office in Bengaluru. Officials from Kerala contended that the ban was affecting economic activities in their state. They said many people from Kerala who work at IT companies in Bengaluru find the journey through the alternative route to be very strenuous.The Kerala government also backed the National Highways Authority of India's proposal to widen the alternative route from Hunsur to Sulthan Bathery via Thithimatti-Gonikoppa-Kutta from the existing 5 metres to 15 metres."We are not keen on lifting the ban, increase the number of vehicles plying during the night and widen roads. This decision will also be communicated to the Supreme Court and the committee," Chief Wildlife Warden, Karnataka, C Jayaram told reporters after the meeting.The meeting was held following a Supreme Court directive to constitute a committee to look into the matter. The apex court is hearing a special leave petition over the issue.The Karnataka High Court banned night traffic on NH-212 and NH-67 on March 9, 2010.
