Contrary to the belief, there are also some people, who have faith in ‘exorcism’', who believe that ‘sacrificing’ the owl on the auspicious day of ‘Deepavali’ would bring wealth to their homes. Accordingly, a large number of owls were sacrificed on the propitious day to invoke the goddess of wealth ‘Laxmi’ as well as to attain ‘siddhi’ (miraculous powers) in Uttar Pradesh.

If a trader, who deals in the sale of rare birds at Nakkhas market in the walled city area is to be believed, the people were ready to pay ‘just about any price’ for the owl. “One can easily fetch Rs 1 lakh for even a small size owl...in fact we ran out of supply”, he said refusing to reveal his name. 

According to reports from Lakhimpur-Kheri and Bareilly , the bird of night had been sold in large numbers to the ‘tantriks’ and even ‘businessmen’, who had planned of holding special ‘pujas’ and ‘yajnas’on Deepavali night.

“The owls are already facing threats from growing urbanisation and cutting of forests and destroying their natural habitat,” wildlife expert Dr Ram Lakhan Singh said.ADVERTISEMENT
