Speaking to mediapersons, he said each family is likely to get maximum of Rs 10 lakh each. The compensation amount will be decided on the basis of property owned by the family. 
He said the district administration does not have any intention to forcibly remove the families from the Park. 

Compensation will be paid to only those families who would like to come out of the Park voluntarily. The government will provide only cash as compensation. The families will have to purchase land from the compensation amount, he informed. 

There are 1,200 families residing in Kuduremukh National Park limits. A proposal on rehabilitation on the families will be prepared after discussing it with Karkala Wildlife Division DFO, the DC added. 

He said a sum of Rs 49.5 crore has been released by the Union government for the development of Kemmannugundi in Tarikere. Infrastructure facilities will be provided to the tourist at Kemmannugundi, said Channappa Gowda.
