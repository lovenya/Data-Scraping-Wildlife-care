The early mornings and evenings were misty, especially during December. But, this is no longer the case. 

This mist-shrouded region bang in the middle of a “backward” district such as Bellary and in close proximity to Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur, Cuddapah and Kurnool was a favourite among British collectors, during the Raj. Ramghad was to these British officers a slice of England. A Little England in the hot climes of Bellary.  

Royal guest house
It was because of this weather that the then British administration built a guest house here. Most British officers in the nearby regions visited the guest house, which was constructed in 1846. And then, there were hunting expeditions in the surrounding forests.

Ramghad has a lot of historical significance. During the 14th and 15th centuries, criminals and ‘traitors’ were imprisoned here. Prince Kumararama, who fought against the Kakatiyas, was also imprisoned at Ramghad. This region came to be called Ramanadurga and Ramanamalai. 

There were forts and other structures built in the region, all remnants of a rich legacy. The British administration also made use of the these fortifications. Prisoners of war who died were buried here. Also, many foreigners were interred here. The over 30 foreigners’ graves that remain are in bad shape. The slabs on top of the graves have been defaced by locals. 

The hill station is 3150 ft above sea level, and is 1200 ft higher than the surrounding Sandur region. The temperature here is a good 10-12 degree celsius lower than Bellary. It rains here in the months of April and May.  

All these factors were conducive to the setting up of a guest house. It is said that a governor from erstwhile Madras (during the British Raj) and his family holidayed here for three months. Also, the agricultural land towards the Western part of Ramghad was ideal for growing European crops. Many European soldiers eventually settled down here. Records say that 404 soldiers lived here between 1866 and 1870. 

The hill station is home to several government office buildings. The Tarakutte bungalow in the hilly town was home to a British captain. Today, Ramghad has changed, thanks to rampant mining. The royal guest house is now in a bad shape.

The deer, wild boars and other rich birdlife that inhabited the forest here for hundreds of years are not to be seen.

The forest is fading away, as well. The wildlife was hunted for the skins and horns by British officers of yore. There were a handful of paths from the forest that led to the bungalows and barracks here. Today, though, there are several paths eating into the forest. The 15 bungalows and barracks built for prisoners during the British rule have now been razed. Some labourers live in the four or five barracks that are left today.
