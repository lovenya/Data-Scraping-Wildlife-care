Rajashekarappa of Hosahalli noticed the leopard next to a tank near his house and called upon his neighbours for help. The leopard, which noticed people around it, entered into a heap of wood in a nearby compound.

The villagers surrounded the leopard which did not come out of its hideout out of fear. They removed the logs from the wood and trapped the leopard in a net alive. 

However, it managed to escape. The villagers then chased the leopard again and were successful in trapping it for the second time.

Range Forest Officer Praveen Kumar and other forest official reached the spot and took the leopard in their custody and released it in the Nagarahole wildlife sanctuary near Metikuppe.ADVERTISEMENT
