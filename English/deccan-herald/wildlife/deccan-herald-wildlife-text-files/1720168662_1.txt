An estimated 10,000 acres of forest area is suspected to have gutted in fire that erupted in Thathkola reserve forest, in the last six days.

ADVERTISEMENTThathkola reserve forest comes under Mudigere and Aldur range of forest and covers 25,000 acre forest land. The forest fire has entered the forests in Kenjige, Balehalli, Kundra, Belagodu, Saragodu, Muthodi, Hullemane Kundooru, Thathkola, Bairigadde, Konabasari, Chikkalla and Aldoor. 

Daily destruction
On an average, 500 acres to 800 acres forest area is being gutted in fire every day. Thathkola reserve forest has valuable trees of teakwood, Honne, Matthi, rosewood. 

The fire has destroyed a majority of these trees. Balooru reserve forest, which is known for wild animals, is situated adjacent to Thathkola. The spreading of fire has posed threat to the lives of the wild animals. 

The wild animals have started straying into the periphery of the forest. Seven king cobras were found in the last four days at Saragodu, Konabasari estate and Kundra areas. The fire has destroyed both green cover and wildlife, the details of which are yet to be known. The forest department staff are trying their best to douse the fire to ensure that the fire do not spread to villages. 

‘No action initiated’
Assistant Forest Guard Muddanna said  that the fire was noticed three days ago. As it was only a grounding fire, the damage would be minimum. About 100 acre would have been gutted.” 

A resident of Kunduru village said  that no action has been initiated to douse the fire. “We can see the fire balls from the forest for a distance of 10-km during the night. King cobras have strayed into the villages,” he said.
