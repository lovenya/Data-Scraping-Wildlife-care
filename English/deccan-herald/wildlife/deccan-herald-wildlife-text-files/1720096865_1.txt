Gangtok: A rare Tibetan brown bear species has been found roaming in the high altitude areas of North Sikkim, officials of the stateâ€™s Forest and Wildlife Department said on Sunday.ADVERTISEMENTCamera traps captured the bear (scientific name: Ursus arctos pruinosus) with its characteristic yellowish scarf-like collar that broadens from the shoulders to the chest in Mangan district last month.This rare bear is very different from the more commonly found Himalayan black bear in terms of its appearance, habitat and behaviour, the officials said.The omnivore lives in high-altitude alpine forests, meadows and steppe above 4000 m and feeds on marmots and alpine vegetation.Also Read:A century later, cane species used by Lepchas rediscovered in Sikkim Also Read:A century later, cane species used by Lepchas rediscovered in Sikkim "The discovery of a rare Tibetan brown bear marks a significant moment for biodiversity in the region and underscores the importance of preserving and protecting the state's precious wildlife," an official said.The Tibetan brown bear, also known as the Tibetan blue bear, is one of the rarest subspecies of bears in the world, and is rarely sighted in the wild.
