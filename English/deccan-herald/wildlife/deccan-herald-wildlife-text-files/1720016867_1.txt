You may be surprised to know that there is such a thing right here in India and in a place where the ocean is nowhere near. Can you guess where that may be?

Majuli is the largest river island in India and lies on the Brahmaputra river in the state of Assam. At one time Majuli was the largest river island in the world, but the mighty Brahmaputra river keeps eating away the land in the course of his passage and so has been relegated to being the second largest river island in the world. At least for this year and in this season. But we shall have to see what the Brahmaputra makes of that claim.

When I heard about Majuli, I packed my bags and headed off. I am pleased to tell you that Majuli is indeed a treasure and somewhere you should try and visit once in your life.

To reach the island one must travel by land or boat from the major city of Guwahati, which sits on the banks of the Brahmaputra river. I drove to the nearest port in the area of Jorhat. The national highway passes through another treasure belonging to the people of India, the Kaziranga National Park, and on this day I was lucky to see rhinos grazing in the green fields beside the road. 

Kaziranga has the biggest population of rhinos in India and these gentle giants are an amazing sight to behold. At this time of year, the park is closed, but from the roadside I was able to spot at least seven rhinos and many different species of deer.

Reaching the ferry that crosses the river thrice daily, I have to tell you that at first I was very nervous to see the load of people and motorbikes, furniture and even a car being loaded onto the boat that was to take us across the wide stretch of the biggest river in India! But the local people all seemed unperturbed and so I stood on board with them and watched in wonder at how the river people manage to live their lives cut off as they are from the mainland.

 Once everything was piled on board, the boatman loosened the ropes and we were sailing on the Brahmaputra. I was more than excited to watch the river sweep majestically along. At this time of year, the Brahmaputra is full with snow that has melted in far-off ranges in Tibet, where the river is born. 

Even though the flow is very swift, because the Brahmaputra  is so wide it’s hard to get the idea of the force of this river. According to my research, the average discharge of the Brahmaputra is about 19,300 cubic metres per second and during flood season it can reach to a startling 100,000 cubic metres! This information didn’t seem to bother the Gangetic dolphins.

 I was excited to see two swim near to the surface and quickly disappear. 
From the boat I saw a rich variety of birdlife, from open-billed storks to kingfishers to cranes. 

By the time the ferry docked at Majuli I had forgotten my initial bewilderment and felt as if I had stepped back in time.

Majuli used to be the largest river island in the world, but the hunger of the richly rushing, silt-laden Brahmaputra has compromised the banks of the river, forcing people to relocate and sometimes even move off the island. This is the case with some of the ancient satras or monasteries that were established there in the 15th century. Originally, Majuli had over 60 satras, but today only 22 are still in operation. 

When I went to one of the satras, it was prayer time and I privileged to watch the monks chant and clash brass symbols. Later, I took a walk around the satra that housed 400 monks. The earth floors were freshly plastered and smoothly welcome on my bare feet.
There was a sense of timelessness about the place as each monk went about his daily business; some weaving fans to sell in the local market. Each monk had his own quarters with a kitchen where they prepared their own meals, although the younger monks who were attending school were lodged in special dorms.

Then, I went to visit a mask maker who lived in another satra. He patiently showed me how he constructed masks from reeds and clay. Satras are famous for being the repository of art and culture. In fact, there are satras set up to preserve culturally-significant items such as weapons and jewellery and other antiques.

In the evening I went to visit a Mishing village. Mishing are the tribal people who mostly populate the island although other tribes exist. The people there were delighted to have a visitor. The kids let me play spinning tops with them in the school grounds and the women showed me their unique weaving looms and unique patterns — another craft that is a treasure of the island. 

The Mishing people have lived with the river a long time and build their houses on stilts to avoid their homes being washed away by floods and to protect them from the odd wandering elephant.

Majuli is indeed India’s Treasure Island — a storehouse of culture and wildlife adrift in the swift flow of time.ADVERTISEMENT
