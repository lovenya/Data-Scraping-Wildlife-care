IDeA Worldwide, a fashion and design institute, recently hosted a gala fashion show and other entertaining events at their ‘Annual Day Showcase’.

The Annual Day was conducted and performed by the graduating students of fashion design and interior design. Held at the Devraj Urs Bhavan, the evening began with a traditional bharatanatyam dance followed by an invocation song. As proud parents and teachers waited for the show to begin, the students were busy running around making sure everything was just perfect. 

The fashion show kickstarted with the students of fashion design courses showcasing their collection. Each sequence was inspired by a theme which ranged from ‘Rainbow’, ‘Wildlife’ to ‘Gangster’. 

“It was great seeing the students work so hard for this event. From the designing, styling to even modelling, everything was done by the students,” said Pavithra, from IDeA. Even the interior design students were encouraged to walk the ramp in their own collection which revolved around the theme ‘Black’.  

Soon enough, the chief guest for the evening, former cricketer Syed Kirmani, along with the director of the institute, Thomas Abraham, came up on stage to give out the prizes and certificates including the best design award of the night. 

But before this, he entertained the crowd by singing a song. “I was pleasantly surprised by the creative skills of such young students and they must be given credit for bringing out such wonderful themes on stage. I also would like to congratulate the institute for being in tune with today’s generation and allowing them to express themselves,” said Syed Kirmani, who gave the Best Design Award to the team that presented the ‘Gangster’ sequence.
