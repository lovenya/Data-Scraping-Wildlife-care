Further, guidelines have also been issued to phase out tourism activities from the core tiger habitats, while creating buffer in its peripheral areas to mainstream tiger concerns vis-à-vis the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972,” Ramesh told the Lok Sabha in a written statement.

Earlier this week, after chairing a National Board of Wildlife meeting, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written to the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand - the three key tiger-bearing states - to declare areas around reserves as eco-sensitive zones as required by law.  The environment minister said the “reports relating to disturbance of wildlife habitat” on account of tourism infrastructure had become a cause for concern.

“The tourism activities around tiger reserves have become new source of tension and threat... action has been initiated for evolving a set of ecotourism guidelines to benefit fringe dwelling local people and relocated villagers, with a view to elicit local public support for tiger conservation,” Ramesh added.ADVERTISEMENT
