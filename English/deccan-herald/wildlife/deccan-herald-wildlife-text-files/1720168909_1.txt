Wildlife activists rescued two bear cubs from a 20-foot-deep uncovered well in Pavagad, Tumakuru district, about 200 km northeast of Bengaluru. The cubs’ mother, however, died from starvation and physical injuries. 
The bears were discovered by local farmers who reported the incident to the Forest Department which in turn contacted the nonprofit, Wildlife SOS. The bears had accidentally fallen into the well and are suspected to have been trapped inside for over 48 hours. The cubs were still nursing from their dead mother when the rescue team rushed to the location on Tuesday evening. 
The bear was around nine years old while her cubs — a male and a female — are around  20 weeks old. Post-mortem evaluation showed that the bear was severely dehydrated and had fractured the lower jaw (mandible) after falling into the well. 

Dr Arun A Sha, director, Wildlife Veterinary Operations, SOS, said the cubs had sustained wounds and abrasions on their body and were under a lot of trauma. They have been moved to the Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre where they will be under continuous medical observation and treatment. 
Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder, Wildlife SOS, said that just 24 hours ago, a pregnant leopard was rescued from drowning in a well in Maharashtra. This is serious matter as the issue of uncovered wells poses a great risk not only to wildlife but also to people. Wildlife SOS has launched a petition to address the issue of open wells so that the safety of people and wild animals is not further jeopardised, he added.
