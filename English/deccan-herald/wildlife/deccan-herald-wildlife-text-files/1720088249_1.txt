The large Navi Mumbai water bodies are considered to be the TCFS’ satellite wetlands.Birder Jyoti Nadkarni said the unsafe drone culture is spreading like virus is often seen at major flamingo zones and it must be checked right now.  Often, some miscreants acting at the behest of vested interests throw stones at the birds apparently to chase them away, environmentalists said. Once the birds stop landing here the vested interests can claim that the water bodies are not flamingo abodes anymore and hence open these areas for development, an activist said.Putting the entire wetland issue in a proper perspective, Kumar regretted that CIDCO treats the wetlands as developable land parcels, ignoring all environmental, and ecological balance issues.
