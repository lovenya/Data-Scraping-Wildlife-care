MLA H K Kumaraswamy alleged that at least two persons are falling prey to the elephant attacks in Alur and Sakleshpur taluks every month, but the government has not taken the issue seriously.ADVERTISEMENTThe jumbos have also been destroying crops worth lakhs of rupees, creating fear and anxiety among the people here, he complained.Speaking to reporters after the Elephant Task Force Committee meeting, presided by Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Tuesday, he said, the meeting was not held since two years despite the rising incidences of human-jambo conflict in the region. District-in-charge Minister and Division Forest Officer are directly responsible for the casualties, he alleged.Responding to our pleas for finding a permanent solution, the DC conducted a meeting and a few important decisions have been taken, he said.Around 40 wild jumbos that are on the prowl in the region should be immediately relocated. The families of the victims of the jumbo attacks should be given a compensation of Rs 10 lakh. Government job for one of the family members and a house under Ashraya scheme should be alloted, he stressed.Elephant corridorThe residents of seven villages coming under Hettur hobli have come forward to donate 2,000 acres of land for the elephant corridor project.The state government has submitted a proposal to the Centre for the elephant corridor measuring 22,000 acres belonging to Forest and Revenue department. But, it has been kept pending for a year. A delegation, led by former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, comprising the legislators of the region, should be taken to the Centre, he said.Though Rs 272 crore has been released for solving the jumbo menace under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management And Planning Authority (CAMPA) fund, it is yet to be implemented as the authorities say that the funds are insufficient. An elephant camp should be set up at Hemavathy backwaters near Nagavara in Alur taluk similar to Dubare elephant camp. A proposal for Rs 1.80 crore has been submitted to the government for the same. It should be implemented immediately, he demanded.Kumaraswamy said, the kumki elephants should be permanently kept here, and forest department should take measures to grow fodder at Doddabetta.He also stressed on setting up a Wildlife Division at Alur-Sakleshpur region and appointing an ACF, RFOs and other employees for the proposed division.
