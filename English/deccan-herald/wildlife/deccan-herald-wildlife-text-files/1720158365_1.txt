Which building out of the three — Vidhan Soudha, Town Hall or the Ravindra Kalashetra — would you want to go green? asks the poster at the entrance of the Basava Bhavan where a two-day exhibition is being held in order to create awareness among the residents of the City to go for renewable sources of energy for their requirements. 

ADVERTISEMENTYou can also cast your vote for the monument that you would like to see powered by renewable energy. These votes as cast by the citizens will be presented to the local government, with an aim of making this dream come true.

 This two-day fair is a part of the global campaign by World Wildlife Federation (WWF) -Seize Your Power, which calls upon governments, institutions and individuals to act immediately and make the transition to renewable energy so that the future is powered by the Sun, wind and water.

At the fair, manufacturers of renewable energy solutions have set up stalls to showcase a wide variety of products; from solar panels, solar water heaters, solar lighting systems to solar cookers and solar refrigerators, and even compact biogas plants for household use. 

Hari Somashekhar, Bengaluru State Director, WWF-India, said that, “Renewable energy solutions are becoming increasingly affordable and easily accessible for individuals today. 

However, the uptake amongst individuals is slow. This fair aims to simplify the message of renewable energy, and showcase how individuals can adopt such solutions into their lives to lead sustainable lifestyles.”
