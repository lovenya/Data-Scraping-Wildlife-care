The group had camped in the place on November 16. After food and drinks, they started fighting regarding some financial issues. Lathif decided to go back to his village. To stop him, the rest pretended to calm him down and Punnachha shot Lathif with his own gun, said the SP.

The four who have been arrested were earlier into Ganja business. They also had financial ties with Lathif. After the fight that night, Lathif said that he won't pay any money. The accused feared that Lathif may speak about their Ganja business in open and hence decided to kill him. There is no other political motive and there is no hand of any influential person in the murder, he said.

The accused also threatened Lathif's car driver to tell that the death was due to an accident. This was the reason, the accidental death complaint was filed.The accused had planned to escape to Kerala from Bangalore. The cops arrested the four in Hunsur.
