Many people were of the opinion that widening the roads are not advisable in the hill range. Instead, the existing roads could be asphalted. Brushing aside all these suggestions, the road was widened. The impact is visible in the form of massive land slides in the hill range, says Wildlife activist G Veeresh.

He says that heavy machines were used to widen the roads. Various development works being undertaken in the name of tourism development, mining at Kemmangundi, works at Dattapeeta, Shola forest encroachment and massive deforestation are adding to the landslides. 

“The road widening has eaten away huge shola forest area. Lot of trees have been felled to make way for various projects. No one is aware as to who has cut those trees, whether forest department has given permission or not,” he said.

He further  adds that such unscientific development works should not be taken up in the sensitive hill range and the entire hill range must be declared ‘project free’ region.ADVERTISEMENT
