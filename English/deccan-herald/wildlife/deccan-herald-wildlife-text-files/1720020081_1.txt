Vets in the zoo operated on the big cat, but had little luck saving her despite removing the bruised tail.  The tiger, which succumbed to the wounds on Friday afternoon, did not bore any cubs. A post mortem report on the tiger said she died of “traumatic shock and old age”. Zoo officials and employees paid floral tributes to Reshma and gave her a guard of honour before performing the last rites. 

DFO Jaipur Ajay Gupta claimed Reshma “was the oldest tigress in the country and perhaps in the world”. The normal life expectancy of a tiger is 14-16 years, though it could be extended to 18 or 19 years in captivity. Reshma outlived any cat in the wild or in captivity and became a star attraction in the zoo. 

Celebrating the record, the authorities released a sticker in her name during the wildlife week observed earlier this month.  “Adults and children, alike, would come to see the tigress who was a favourite among visitors because of her colour and pleasant disposition,” the zoo officials said. With Reshma’s passing, the zoo has four female and one male tigers. 

Reshma was also the only white tiger in the zoo, considered  the result of a genetic defect.  The Jaipur zoo authorities are planning to get two white tigers from Delhi in exchange of a pair of wolfs.ADVERTISEMENT
