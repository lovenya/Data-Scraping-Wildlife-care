The ‘Tanzanian Student Association’ of Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies organised a cultural exhibition recently. The fourth edition of the annual exhibition showcased the cultural heritage and social life of Tanzania.

There were also many food counters with Tanzanian food items like dried Choya (Roselle which is used for preparing healthy juices and rich in vitamins), Daga (dry fish), dried pumpkin leaves and traditional coffee powder.

The handicrafts and leather items displayed at these stalls were also very attractive. The students created many posters portraying the various facets of the country, including its political system and the economic condition. 

The students of the Association had come dressed in their ethnic clothes and the colours of their national flag were painted on their cheeks. They also performed a traditional Tanzanian dance, which depicted the culture of many regions in East Africa including Kenya and Zanzibar.

There are more than 50 students from Tanzania studying at Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies. “Ours is a country blessed with natural beauty. People follow the traditions of the particular tribe they belong to. So it is not possible to showcase everything at a single exhibition. But we have tried our best to make people understand the basic things about our country,” says Diana, a second year. 

BCom student, who hails from Tanzania. “People have the false notion that Tanzania is a war-ridden country. That is not the case. We are peace-loving people and a lot of developmental activities are taking place in our country,” she adds. 

George, another student from Tanzania who is pursuing BCA, says that he didn’t know that his Indian friends would be curious about his country and its people. “My friends wanted to know about our government, the economic development there and the significance of the colours used in the Tanzanian flag. For the last four years, the college has supported us wholeheartedly to organise this event. We are thankful to everyone who made it possible,” he says.  

Anisha Nongrum, a third year BA student, says, “The event was very exciting. We visited the stalls, read the posters, tried Tanzanian food and watched an amazing dance performance. It was very informative too. I didn’t know that Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in the African continent, is in Tanzania. It also has three well-known lakes including Lake Victoria. If at all I get a chance to go to Africa, I will visit Tanzania.”
