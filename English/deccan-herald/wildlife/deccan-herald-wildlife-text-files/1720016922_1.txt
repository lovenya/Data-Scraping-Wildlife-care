Toxins emerged out of thermal power plant remain in the closed chamber of nature destroying the environment set ups, human health and natural resources. The affect will be long lasting and the sufferings will increase in the days to come, he added.

As per the environment report submitted regarding the environment assessment earlier, there are as many as 105 butterfly species in this 25 sq km biodiversity area. Besides, there are animal and plant varieties that are deemed to be protected under Wildlife Act of 1972, Schedule 1. There is a need for serious debate over conserving these species. Sarcastically, authoritarian rule is exercised over the people here and democratic opinion has been subdued. The system should be blamed as the system is the one that remains permanent irrespective of which government rules the State, he opined.

Emission of Carbon Dioxide will have increased heating effect in the area and nitrous oxide and Nitrogen dioxide will cause acid rain. Carbon and Sulphur particles in ashes will cause bronchitis and other lungs related problems, he added.

Stating that public should come forward to protest the power plant, he said the emulsions are slow poison and people need to think in terms of future generations along side their own well being. Mass opposition will yield better outcome. People should raise their voice against atrocities, he cautioned.

Former MLA U R Sabhapathy said both Central and State government should put pressure on the Company to stop functioning. Hundreds of acres of fertile agricultural land have been destroyed for the setting up of thermal power project. The influence of ash pond and the effluent water released by the company on human life in the area calls for immediate action against the plant. The district administration has utterly failed to take measure. The DC has not analysed the situation even after the reports of grave sufferings of the people over there, he alleged.The padyatra started after offering prayers at Sri Kargeshwari Brahmasthna temple at Padubidri.
