The police have collected footage from a private television network to identify individuals who had ransacked the checkpost and Range Forest Office of Palar Wildlife Division in Chamarajanagar.

ADVERTISEMENTThe villagers had ransacked the checkpost, after Palani (in pic), who is suspected for poaching activities, was found dead on the banks of Adi Palar river in Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary limits. Infuriated by the incident, a mob of more than 100 people, according to the Forest department staff, had ransacked the checkpost.

Police sources said that even though there was information about the persons behind the ransacking, arrests could not be made as the situation was tense. “We fear that the situation will aggravate along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border if people are arrested. 

We will wait for a week, before going ahead to nab the persons who damaged the property of the Forest department,” the sources said. Security has been beefed up near the checkpost. The autopsy report is awaited.
