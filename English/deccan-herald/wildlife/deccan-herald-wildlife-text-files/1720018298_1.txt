A new temple is coming up on the Hunsur-Gonikoppa road in Kachuvinahalli near the Anechaukur range of the Nagarahole National Park.

Members of the temple committee invited Forest Minister C H Vijayashankar on April 25 and sought an alternative space for constructing a new temple since the district administration may demolish the old one for widening the road.

With senior forest officers failing to apprise the minister of the Supreme Court order, the minister gave them permission to construct the temple within the forest area.
Now, the committee has begun constructing the temple within Nagarahole and space has been made for the temple by clearing branches of trees.

The construction is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Supreme Court order in a case between Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India in 1996.

The forest officers now face the dilemma of whether to follow the forest minister’s directive or the Supreme Court order.

Field Director of Project Tiger, B J Hosmath, told Deccan Herald: “It is true that the minister has given permission for the temple’s construction. But the construction has been stalled for the time being and we will see what happens 
later.” 

Another temple is being constructed at the Hosur Kodagu Colony on the Hunsur-H D Kote Road. 

There is a main road in front of the temple and a piece of land belonging to Sollepura Tobacco Research Board behind it. 

Mysore-based wildlife conservationist P M Muthanna points out that there are absolutely no private properties around the area and the temple is undoubtedly being built on public land. 

“The construction of the temple has been underway for the past two months and there is no way one can miss it, since it is right on the Hunsur-H D Kote Main Road. 

Yet, the village accountant, revenue inspector, tahsildar and other officers who use this road daily, have failed to notice the illegal structure,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT
