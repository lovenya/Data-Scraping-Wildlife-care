The laying of a road at Shishilabetta which receives highest rainfall in the district and diversion of water from Hebbe Falls situated in Bababudangiri to Madaga and Ayyanakere to Bhadra river basin should be dropped as they are hazardous to nature, Bhadra Wild Life Conservation Trust Managing Trustee D V Girish, wildlife protection activist G Veeresh and State Wildlife Board former member S Girijashankar have said.ADVERTISEMENTRecommendations by Union Minister D V Sadananda Gowda to construct a road at the Shishila hills, which consist of green cover, is a dangerous decision. There is no requirement of roads as already there are five connecting roads to provide link to Dakshina Kannada and the neighbouring areas. During the BJP's Navakarnatakaâ€ˆParivarthana Rally in Mudigere, Sadananda Gowda has said that if BJP comes to power, the construction of Shishila- Bhairapura Road will be taken up and the Central government has reserved Rs 8 crore funds for the purpose, they said.The environmentalists said that the construction of roads can be detrimental to the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats.Also, there is another project of diverting water from Hebbe Flls to Bhadra river basin. The project was dropped after realising that it is technically  not feasible and will cause harm to the nature. But, a delegation, led by Congress leader B L Shankar, has met the water resources minister and has discusses about the possibilities of take up the project."It is the need of the hour to preserve the hills, rivers and forests in their original form. While carrying out projects, it should be ensured that the nature is not disturbed. The Shishila-Bhairapura Road construction and project of diverting water from Hebbe Falls should be stopped", the environmentalists have urged.River Vedavathi in Kadur taluk is on the verge of extinction. The river sources should not be disturbed. The project towards the supply of water from Bhadra river to Kadur, Birur and Tarikere has been initiated.Similar projects can be implemented in Yagachi and Hemavathi dams, they said in a press release.
