The project is close to the sanctuary, Naik said.

Ramesh said it is his ministry’s policy that “any project which comes to us for approval, which is in the vicinity of an ecological sensitive area or a wildlife sanctuary, we look at it according to the rules and regulations of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and I am sure, the Mahadayi project also will be no exception in this regard”.

The Karnataka government notified 13,000 hectares of Bhimgad forest in Belgaum as a wildlife sanctuary on February 3 this year, Ramesh told the House. Asked if Karnataka had applied for environment clearances before starting on the construction of the Kankumbi canals Ramesh told Naik he did not want to get into the legality or illegality of the Mahadayi project, specially since a Tribunal is being set up by the Central Government on the issue.
