But its rawness, coarseness and callousness are the qualities that have made the song the new ‘anthem of the internet’.
Dhanush wrote the song in 20 minutes. He sung it in no time as the tune too was set in a jiffy. 

  “It didn’t take me too long to write the song. It was meant not to be but when I heard the tune, the lyrics just popped out of me,” Dhanush tells Metrolife after taking some time off from shooting of ‘3’, a movie directed by his wife Aishwarya for which Kolaveri Di has been recorded.
 
Dhanush confesses that he had a ball during the recording of the song. “The music director wanted a very raw voice that’s not perfect and they wanted it to be as incorrect as possible. That’s the beauty of the piece,” says Dhanush, who can't get over the excitement of having conjured something out of nothing. 

Will he attempt something similar again? “Why not?” he asks. “If I am so bowled over by the tune and feel the urge to write and sing as well then I will attempt it again,” he says. Dhanush reasons that technology has advanced so much that anything imperfect can be made to sound or even appear perfect. 

Dhanush and Aishwarya have teamed up together for the first time, so what support and encouragement does he lend his wife? “Nothing really, she does her job and I do mine,” he avers. 

As Dhanush was soaking in the success of Kolaveri Di, his film Mayakkam Enna hit the screens. He confesses that he sat and watched two shows back to back on the day of its release. “I play a ‘wannabe’ wildlife photographer who believes in his dream. For him, life is never easy. His friend helps him in achieving his goal. Soon he falls in love and that changes everything,” he adds.  

Dhanush also has his set of crazy fans. 

Ask him about his soaring popularity and he says, “I am an ordinary man with ordinary looks. I am no hero material. I only choose roles that suit my personality.”  
Shuttling from one shoot to another, Dhanush says he can barely snatch enough time to spend with his two sons. “I hardly get to see them but I am sure they will understand that I am working hard for them,” he signs off.
