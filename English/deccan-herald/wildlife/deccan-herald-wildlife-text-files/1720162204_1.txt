The Congress has opposed the T S R Subramanian committee’s recommendations for review of environmental laws, saying Narendra Modi government has now set in motion an ‘abominable exercise’ of dismantling the regime of environment protection, tribal rights and equitable social development. 

All the Congress-ruled states also expressed their reservations on the Subramanian  committee’s recommendations at a meeting of environment ministers held here on Tuesday. 
After the land acquisition ordinance, the Congress seemed to be ready to raise the issue of environmental protection in a larger scale to corner the Narendra Modi-led government as it vowed to take ‘the fight from street to Parliament.’

 “Having bulldozed the Land Acquisition ordinance aimed at grabbing the land of hapless and marginal farmers, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has now set in motion the abominable exercise of dismantling the carefully crafted regime of environment protection, sustainable development, tribal rights and equitable social development,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters.

The T S R Subramanian committee’s report seeks to hit at the ‘very base’ of the Environment Protection Act, Forests Conservation Act, Wildlife Protection Act, The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and The Indian Forest Act, he added.

  The Congress leader, joined by Karanataka Environment Minister Ramanath Rai and Minister for Food and Civil Supplies Dinesh Gundu Rao, noted that the Subramanian Committee report was prepared in just 60 days and was being utilised to “disregard Constitutional provisions, carefully deliberated and tested laws, national environment policy and international treaties and the UN conventions as well.”

“The Modi government is continuing with its unabated attack on India’s land, forest and environment in its insatiable quest to appease a handful of friendly crony capitalists,” he charged.

Surjewala also raised a series questions on the National Democratic Alliance government’s move to bring changes in the environment and forest laws, demanding that the prime minister clarify if the economic development policy of his government would override the ‘principles of human being’.
