The State Forest department’s objective to conserve tigers in Bandipur National Park got a shot in the arm on Friday, with the aid of an additional 300 camera trapping equipment.

ADVERTISEMENTParticipating in a programme organised at Bandipur, to receive the camera traps from CSS Corp, a multi-national company in technology and IT infrastructure, as a part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden Ravi Ralph said, “At a time when tiger protection and wildlife conservation has turned out to be a paramount exercise, such initiatives will go a long way in maintaining and strengthening the ecological balance”. Outgoing Director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve H C Kantharaj said the camera traps have been deployed with the objective of conducting a scientific tiger census, analysing animal behaviour patterns, detecting people’s movement in the forest and identifying mischievous activity in the region. “These camera traps, once deployed, provide round-the -clock monitoring and protect the big cats,” he added.

CEO of CSS Corp Ramesh, popular as ‘Tiger’ Ramesh for his eco-friendly initiatives, said that buoyed by the success at Nagarahole and Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserves (DATR), they looked towards Bandipur to replicate the success.

 “The tiger is at the apex of the ecosystem and extremely critical for the survival of future generations. We will continue to support the initiatives for wildlife protection and tiger conservation,” he said.

CSS Corp has donated the camera traps ahead of tiger census which carried once in four years. According to a set of guidelines by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), it is mandatory to install camera traps to record the number of wild cats in the area. Apart from Bandipur, the company has donated 400 camera traps to Nagarahole Tiger Reserve and 100 to DATR.
