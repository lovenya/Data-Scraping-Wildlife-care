The new resorts will come up in Jog Falls in Shimoga district, Khanapur near Belgaum and Apsarakonda in Uttar Kannada district,  company Managing Director N D Tiwari told Deccan Herald  here on Tuesday. Tiwari was in the national capital in connection with  “Karnataka Tourism Day” and to showcase the State’s tourist spots to the local residents. The company is also exploring possibilities of opening similar resorts in Hampi, Badami and other tourist spots in the State. 

Now, the company owns 16 properties, which are occupied up to 70 per cent throughout the year. The company revenue is expected to reach around Rs 40 crore in the current fiscal, which is around Rs five crore more than last year due to the increasing influx of foreign tourists. It caters to around 30 per cent of foreign tourists per annum.

Heli-tourism
Director, Department of Tourism, K Vishwanatha Reddy said the State’s helicopter tourism project would be operational after September, at the end of the monsoon season. 
The State Government has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Delhi-based OSS Air, which will be the tour operator.

The Tourism department will promote heritage centres such as Hampi, Badami, Aihole, Pattadakal and Bijapur for the heli-tourism project. The government is providing the basic infrastructure at these locations. The demand-driven package will be decided by the operator, Reddy said.ADVERTISEMENT
