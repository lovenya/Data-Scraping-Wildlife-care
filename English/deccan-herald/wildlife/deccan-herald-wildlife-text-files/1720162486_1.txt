A two-day workshop on conservation and rescue of snakes, has been organised from May 16 in the city. The workshop titled Scientific Training on Reptile Management (STORM) will be held in collaboration with Corporator Balasubramanya popularly known as ‘Snake’ Shyam.

ADVERTISEMENTP Gowrishankar, also a snake rescuer told Deccan Herald, the workshop will delve on both theoretical and practical aspects of rescue and conservation of the reptile. Even though not all the participants pursue their interest further, there are five to six interested lot added to the growing tribe of rescuers after the very exercise. 

The workshop in its fourth year has been imparting training to 60 to 70 interested people every year.

The theoretical aspect will throw light on the behaviour, habitat and diversity of snake species in the region, while live rescue calls is expected to help the participants to get on the field experience. The workshop is open to people irrespective of education, age and fields having the common interest in conservation, said Gowrishankar.

Explaining about the significance of the workshop, Gowrishankar said ‘even as wildlife conservation efforts have gathered steam nowadays, snakes and other species of reptiles are sidelined in such efforts. 

This despite snakes being most vulnerable to man-animal conflict with hundreds of them killed on a daily basis.

Cases of conflict with snakes are very high as compared to other animals, such as the large mammals. However, neither forest nor the police department have devised adequate measures to address the conflict.

Noting that snakes are usually killed by people as soon as they are spotted, Gowrishankar said that more awareness is required to prevent people from doing so. 

Moreover, the number of snake rescuers has to be increased, for the current low strength being yet another reason for the lack of conservation efforts, said Gowrishankar.
