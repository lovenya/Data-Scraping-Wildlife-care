Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, BBP, M N Jayakumar, emphasised on the emergent need to sensitise people on wildlife conservation in view of the theme of ‘World Environment Day: Many Species-One Planet-One Future’. “We need to change and strengthen the protection mechanism in conserving the existing wildlife,” Jayakumar added.

Conservator of Forests, BBP, Millo Tago called upon the corporate sector to join hands in wildlife conservation. “There is a huge cost involved in maintaining biological parks and also animals. Donations made towards conservation of wildlife can be used in rejuvenating and re-designing the biological park,” he said.

At BBP, out of 1,400 animals of 70 different species, 86 animals have been adopted by different organisations. On a more positive note, 56 animals alone were adopted this year.ADVERTISEMENT
