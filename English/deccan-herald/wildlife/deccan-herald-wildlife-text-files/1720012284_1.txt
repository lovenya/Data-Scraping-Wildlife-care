District administration had permitted construction of hotels, steps, installation of concrete pillars in sensitive Kavikalgandi region. The works were stopped because Forest Department denied permission but after a few days the concrete pillars were installed over night, thereby violating the law.

Concrete pillars are being installed at certain places of Chandradrona hills, which are considered as one of the 25 ecological hot spots of the world. It is said that this will have an adverse affect on the natural habitat of wild animals and birds. 

Environmentalists have said that they will move the court of law if district administration continues its negligent attitude.

Kavikalgandi finds place in pages of history because it is believed that many spiritual heads had come to the region to indulge into spiritual experience. Unfortunately, this very same spiritual destination has been converted into an open bar. 

The large number of empty liquor bottles lying at the feet of the painting of Swami Vivekananda speaks a volume at what situation the range of hills have come to.ADVERTISEMENT
