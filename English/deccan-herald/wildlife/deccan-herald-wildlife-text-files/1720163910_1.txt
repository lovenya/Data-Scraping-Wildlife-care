A tiger from the wild was spotted inside the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) safari area at Mulegundekere (near animal rescue centre), on Saturday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe carnivore was sighted around 3.45 pm by BBP bus driver Satish and safari visitors in the vehicle. 

BBP Executive Director Range Gowda said that it was the first direct sighting in this area. 
“The presence of a tiger from the wild in the Park can now be confirmed. Camera traps are being installed near the spot to get more details. The bus and jeep drivers have been told to be careful,” a BBP official said. 

The information on the sighting has been given to the Zoo Authority of Karnataka, he added. The decision on capturing or allowing the tiger to roam free would be taken based on the data obtained from camera traps.

Sunil Pawar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bannerghatta National Park, told Deccan Herald that they had received information of a tiger moving  from Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary to BNP via Bilikerebetta.
