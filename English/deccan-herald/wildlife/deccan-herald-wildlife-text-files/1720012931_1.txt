Not much except that the lights will be out at all three places on Saturday evening from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm as part of the World Wildlife Fund’s global campaign on climate change ‘Earth Hour 2010’.

Bangalore joins a list of 6,000 cities and towns from all over the world to support the campaign. The city’s IT giants including Wipro, Infosys, Intel and corporates such as ING Vysya have pledged their support to the campaign. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has pledged its support and have urged their customers to support the initiative. The Brigade Road Shop Owners Association and the Electronic City Industries Association too have expressed their support for the campaign.

The black-out will extend to Government premises such as the Vidhana Soudha and other public buildings in the city. Infosys has organised an ‘Earth Habba’ where eco-friendly entrepreneurs - will be setting up stalls to sell green products and services. At Datacraft, employees will receive a lantern which can be used to avoid electricity and also competition to come up with the best energy saving ideas. 

The Earth Hour, originally kicked off at Sydney, Australia in 2007 and by the next year, the campaign was supported by 370 cities in over 35 countries across 18 time zones. An estimated 50 to 100 million people switched off their lights in 2008 including at global landmarks such as the Roman Colosseum and Times Square. 

Last year the initiative was even bigger with 4159 towns and cities including 73 national capitals across 88 countries participating.ADVERTISEMENT
