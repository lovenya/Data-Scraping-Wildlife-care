What made you to come to India?
I had heard a lot of wonderful things about India and I wanted to get the experience. Besides some of my seniors who studied in India gave me the beautiful idea about India and also they told me about the good quality of education here.

How do you find the quality of education here and what do you feel about the fee structure?
It’s really worth studying here. Actually, we have good standard of education for a very reasonable price.

Tell us something about your experiences in India?
It is exciting. People here are very friendly and they help us whenever we are in problems. It is totally different. Moreover, people know little bit of English and Hindi that helps us to communicate with localities.  

Which are the other places you visited in India?
I went to Mumbai once and I feel it as over crowded and noisy. It is more polluted. I prefer Manipal to Mumbai as this place is less crowded.

What are the differences and similarities of cultural aspects you observed in India when compared to your country?
It is almost similar. People are conservative and less westernized. We have a strong family bond back at home which could be observed in India also. It is bonding of love and care.

How do you find the food and style of dressing here?
Some items are spicy and others are almost like home food. I like paneer as it is the new thing I tried here. Indian dresses are beautiful and a way of self representing that gives respectful look.

Would you ask your friends to come here for studies?
Sure. I would tell them to come to India rather then going to west for their higher studies. Here we get homely atmosphere with different experiences.ADVERTISEMENT
