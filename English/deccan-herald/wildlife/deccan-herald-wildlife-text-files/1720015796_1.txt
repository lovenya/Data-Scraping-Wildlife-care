Innovative technology for IMT

Institute of Management Technology (IMT) will use an ‘innovative technology’, developed by a Chicago-based company, in its forthcoming post-graduate management admission process in order to make it more transparent and create better chances for equal opportunity to applicants. 

“IMT is all set to collaborate with VMock Inc., a Chicago, Illinois based company, which has developed a patent-pending online platform innovation that will help talent short-listing and executive learning and development (ELD) in a unique way,” the Ghaziabad-based B-school announced.

The technology will be pioneered in the forthcoming post graduate diploma in management (PGDM) admissions process for the upcoming academic season, it said.
The first phase of the partnership will focus on the “much debated admission process” at B-schools.  IMT-VMock will, for the very first time, create a more holistic admission process that will combine “hard score with a soft score”, the institute’s director and academic mentor of the IMT Group, Bibek Banerjee, said. 

“This technology is going to be more transparent, will create better chances for an equal opportunity to applicants by reducing situational biases and will capture the human side of applicants,” he said adding that IMT-VMock partnership will redefine B-school leadership by exploiting the untapped potential of technology.
