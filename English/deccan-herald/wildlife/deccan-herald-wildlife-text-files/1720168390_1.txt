The 24-year-old son of a forester from Tamil Nadu has been arrested by the CID forest cell in Bengaluru on charges of selling Alexandrine parakeets online.

ADVERTISEMENTThe HSR Layout police arrested the man - identified as Rahul Raj N, son of a forester from Aroor in Dharmapuri district - and produced him before a magistrate who remanded him in judicial custody.

The forest cell sleuths received information that the man, an engineer with a mobile phone service provider, sold the parakeets for Rs 4,500 a pair by posting ads online. 

The sleuths deployed a decoy who posed himself as a prospective customer and approached Raj in HSR Layout. When the decoy confirmed that the parakeets were of the protected species, Raj was detained. 

A case was registered and he was handed over to the jurisdictional police. Eight parakeets were rescued from him and were sent to the Bannerghatta rescue centre. 

“By the time we caught him, he told us he had already sold 12 birds in the day. He had sourced the birds from a pet shop in Koyambedu, Chennai,” Purushottam, inspector with the CID forest cell, told DH.

“Alexandrine parakeets are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Even disturbing the bird’s nest or touching its egg and putting it back into the nest amounts to wildlife crime,” Sharath Babu R, wildlife warden, told DH.
