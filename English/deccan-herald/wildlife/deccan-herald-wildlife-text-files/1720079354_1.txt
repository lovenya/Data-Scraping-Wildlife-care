The captive elephant Kusha could not join his mate in the forest of Dubare. Instead, he was released into the forest of Moolehole wildlife division of Bandipur in Chamarajanagar district on Thursday evening after placing a radio caller on him.ADVERTISEMENTWith the help of tamed elephants from Dubare, the elephant was taken in a vehicle belonging to the elephants' rapid action force of Dubare elephant camp to Bandipur. According to the direction of the principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and chief wildlife conservator, a radio was placed on Kusha and he was released into the forest of Moolehole under the Bandipur Tiger Conservation area. Kusha, who had left the Dubare camp a year ago for mating, did not return. The forest department captured and brought him back to the camp on March 30. However, he did not oblige his mahout and was confined to the kraal once again for training. <img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2Ffile7g2tiiqjg2d1hogl9gww.jpg?w=1200" alt="Elephant Kusha boarding a lorry with the help of tamed elephants.
