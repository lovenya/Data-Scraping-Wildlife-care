The good news comes exactly a year after the reserve was declared without any tigers.
“The state government’s tiger rehabilitation programme in Panna has proved to be a great success. The tigress brought from Bandhavgarh National Park has been spotted with three healthy cubs on May 7,” a park official said.

“Though we had received indications about the tigress giving birth last month, it could not be confirmed since she was hiding in a place difficult for the park officers to reach. The news was confirmed only when the tigress decided to shift her cubs to a better place,” said R Sreenivasa Murthy, field director, Panna.

“The cubs are more than 20 days old and healthy. We managed to get it confirmed on Friday night and have prohibited tourist visits to the area.” 

One tigress each from Bandhavgarh and Kanha national parks were brought to Panna last year and a tiger brought from Pench National Park in November for mating. ADVERTISEMENT
