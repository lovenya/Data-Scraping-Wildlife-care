Born in 1932, TNE Perumal took up wildlife photography in 1960. “I was fascinated by wildlife since my school days. I loved reading shikari literature and animal and true life adventure stories. 
The Bannerghatta forest was close to my house and I would always end up going there to see the animals. I am grateful to my then school master O C Edwards who inspired me to take photographs. I then took to taking photographs of every kind of animal,” he said.
A keen observer of the evolution photography in India, Perumal said, “Earlier there were so many limitations as there no proper equipment but now it is an open market. One can get all sorts of cameras in India as the standards have gone up. It is very easy for people to get the equipment now.” His favourite animals happen to be the elephant and the leopard. “The elephant and leopard are my favourites. The owl is my latest fascination and I also like all the different types of birds and the small insects.”

Capturing wild animals in a proper frame is not very easy. There are many challenges regarding this. He said, “It is not easy to photograph wild animals, a lot of patience is required. The biggest challenge is to capture the personality of each animal. Each animal is very distinct. Do not startle them and try to avoid flash on the camera as much as possible.”

Perumal signed off by offering valuable tips to wildlife photography enthusiasts. He said, “Try to keep in mind the conservation of the animals and be sensitive to the animals and people should be aware of the perils that these animals face today. Every animal is 
splendid in its own way and should be given equal importance. People should also know about the little species like the insects because we still have so may species we do not 
know much about.”ADVERTISEMENT
