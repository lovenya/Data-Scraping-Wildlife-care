He has shown the corelation between the changes in the Mallanagowda elephant corridor and the increased conflict with elephants.

The area used by wild animals like elephants, wild buffalo, tigers and other animals were tracked using GPS in the Biligirirangana forest range. The food habits of the wild animals can also be tracked. The human- animal encounter has increased due to the human activities in the forest area.

The conservation of the elephant corridor is of utmost importance and is stressed as this will automatically cover the habitat of many other wild animals.

Around 20 per cent of India is covered with forest out of which only four percent is protected. Mos of the forests are being destroyed in the name of development, agricultural land or resorts in the name of eco tourism. The wild animals will move to other forests in search of water food shelter and better weather conditions.

The Elephant Task Force was created in 1992 and three corridors were identified in the Biligiri ranga hill range. The elephant habitat is also the habitat of many other wild animals and this species act as an umbrella, and hence protection of these corridors is essential said Sindhuvalli Paramesh.

Wild life scientists report that the 500 elephant population conservation in the Biligiri Ranga Hills forest range will help in the protection of the habitat of wild animals like wild buffalo, deer, wild boar, black bear and wild dogs.
