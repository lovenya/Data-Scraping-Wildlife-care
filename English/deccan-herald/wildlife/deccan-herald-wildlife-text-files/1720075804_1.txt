In 2018, the state was in the 'aspirant' category in 2018 and has since migrated to the 'performer' stage though the data on which the performance is assessed is based on old data, the chief minister had said. The SDG Index released by the Niti Aayog in 2021 has ranked Assam as 'performer' with a score of 57 which is a marginal improvement of the previous index score of 55 released in 2019.
