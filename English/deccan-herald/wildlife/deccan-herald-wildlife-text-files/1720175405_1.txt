Wildlife volunteers with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) were in for a surprise on Monday when they came across a rare albino cobra at a house in Gokula Extension in Mathikere limits. According to snake rescuers, it is for the first time that an albino cobra has been rescued in Bengaluru. ADVERTISEMENTFollowing a distress call at around 7:30 am, snake rescuer Rajesh Kumar and Vivek Urs rushed to the spot and were taken aback on seeing a two-day-old albino cobra hatchling. “It was indeed a surprise to see an albino cobra for the first time even though we have been rescuing snakes during the monsoon season,” said Rajesh Kumar. Resting at a corner of the house, the hatchling was nowhere close to humans. The volunteers carefully rescued the snake in a box and later released it into the wild. Later, the volunteers combed the area for other hatchlings.
