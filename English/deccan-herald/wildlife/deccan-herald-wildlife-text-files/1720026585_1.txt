British supermodel Naomi Campbell's planned elephant polo match for boyfriend Vladimir Doronin's 50th birthday bash in Jodhpur has been criticised by animal activists group PETA.

ADVERTISEMENTThe 42-year-old is reportedly planning the match during the four-day long birthday celebrations.

"PETA India urges Naomi Campbell to respect elephants and Indian wildlife and immediately withdraw her plans to organise this cruel sport. It's sad to appallingly predictable for her to exploit India's national and natural treasure," said Benazir Suraiya of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

The couple, who have been dating since 2008, arrived in Jodhpur yesterday and will be having a pre birthday bash at the Mehrangarh Fort on November 6.

The birthday celebration will be held at two venues of the fort - Daulat Khana and Zenana Courtyard on November 7.

Peta also plans to meet with officials at the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and Wildlife Department to ask them to refrain from issuing any permission to allow this event.

"Elephant polo is a widely condemned cruel sport which supports the violation of numerous Indian animal protection laws and offends everyone who cares about leaving wild animals in the wild. I have no doubt that she would hire cowboys and put bucking straps on cattle if she put on the party there," Suraiya added.
