“We are questioning the school authorities to find out how the human foetuses reached in the school, who had ordered to bring the human foetuses in the school laboratory. 

“The school staff has not given us any satisfactory answer to our queries. We are verifying school documents and interrogating school staff in this regard,” Singh said.
“Police have also apprehended principal of the school M Varshley for keeping human foetuses and banned animals in the school for experiment,” Gupta said.

“We were shocked to find  that the school had preserved male and female human foetuses. Earlier, we had approached the school authorities to share our information about which species of animals could be preserved at school laboratory, but they said they did not have any banned species of animals in their school,” said Gupta.
A week ago, a raid was conducted at Acharya Narendra Dev College where the zoological department was conducting experiments on endangered species of animals.
