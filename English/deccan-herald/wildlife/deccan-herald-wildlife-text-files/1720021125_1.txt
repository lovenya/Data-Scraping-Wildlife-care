During his various stints at different places, Vinod has been capturing the glory and diversity of the wildlife. 

Vinod looked at it as an opportunity to capture the wildlife heritage through his camera. His passion for wildlife photography started in 2004 when he was posted at Raipur (Chattisgarh) as the commissioner, central excise. 

He says, “It is an honest beginning to know the secrets of nature and share my experiences to conserve our wildlife which may get lost after a few decades. I want the exhibition to become an eye-opener for the new generation.”

The artist also feels that the alternative approach of making people aware would be to celebrate the wildlife of India as part of its rich heritage. He is confident that celebration of wildlife as a heritage, rather showcasing the worrisome situation of wildlife conservation, may appeal people. Adds Vinod who is currently serving as the commissioner of customs (import and general) in Delhi, “I want people to love wildlife and feel its aura and glory.”

Through this first in the series of exhibitions, the artist showcases the “Tiger’s Realm” through photographs clicked across several wildlife habitats in the country over the past eight years. The artist invites everyone to take a peek into the natural habitat of animals and birds with its glory and magnificence. The exhibition is on till December 15.
