The man-eater, which was trapped at HD Kote, and transferred into the care of the Mysore zoo, is said to be suffering from ‘severe handling stress’ after its capture.

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to a press release issued by the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, the tiger has sustained injuries on the nose and on its back. The left limb shows a large swelling which is indicative of a fracture. Veterinarians reported that the condition of the animal is critical. “A detailed medical examination and X-ray will reveal the nature of fracture and a decision can be taken on treatment,” they said. The tiger is estimated to be aged between 10 and 12 years old. Zoo executive director B P Ravi said that as the average life-span of a tiger in the wild is about 12 years, the animal may have started to target easier game — cattle in the region — because of its old age. When asked if the tiger will continue to remain in the zoo after its recovery, Ravi said that the animal’s future at the zoo depends on the decision of the Central Zoo Authority.

The zoo authorities have decided against moving the animal from the cage as it had not fully recovered. Water with electrolytes had been provided at its cage before the animal was transferred to a holding room, where a preliminary examination was conducted.

Permission for surgery on the animal is expected to come soon from the Chief Wildlife Warden. The presence of Dr Vasanthy Shetty, the dean of the Veterinary College at Hassan, has also been requested to assist and guide the possible surgery.
