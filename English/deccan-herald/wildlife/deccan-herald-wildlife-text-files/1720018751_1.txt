Animal Planet presents ‘Mad Mike And Mark’ on September 19 at 9 pm. Hosts Mark Tennant and Mike Penman join forces and camera equipment to present a fresh series that uncovers life as a wildlife photographer.

Tennant will do anything to get a great shot; Penman will do anything to get a better one.

There are some very basic rules for surviving in the wild. Find shelter, water, food and help. 

In Discovery Channel’s new series ‘Dual Survivor’, meet military-trained Dave Canterbury and naturalist Cody Lundin — trained survival experts — who will take on some of the planet's most unforgiving terrain to demonstrate — in their own way — how the right skills and some creative thinking can keep you alive. 

Equipped with minimal gear carried in the real-life situations, Canterbury and Lundin must draw upon their arsenal of skills to devise extraordinary ways to use what they can find in their surroundings, as well as ordinary objects and demonstrate what it takes to stay alive. The show airs on September 19 at 8 pm.
