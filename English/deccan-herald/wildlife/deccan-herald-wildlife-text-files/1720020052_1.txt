Thanks to the winters in Delhi this year, winged visitors have thronged the Okhla Bird Sanctuary here in full force.

Several species of migratory birds come to roost in Delhi from other parts of India and abroad in winters. Many of them come from places as far as Afghanistan, Tibet, China, Europe and Siberia, traversing Himalayan terrain. 

They generally arrive around the month of October, fleeing the severe cold in their homelands, and leave by March with the onset of summers. The Okhla Bird Sanctuary, being the only protected area for birds in Delhi other than the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary in extreme South, makes for an ideal seasonal resting place for these birds.

The ranger of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary J M Bannerjee is thrilled with the number of birds the area has attracted. He informs, “At present the barrage area is housing up to 25,000 to 30,000 migratory birds of at least 200 species. The official counting exercise is still going on but this is a rough estimate. The bird species which have turned out in good numbers and can be spotted easily are the Northern Shoveller, Gadwall, Northern Pintail, Ruddy Shelduck, Common Shelduck, Common Teal, Tufted Duck, Common Pochard, Ferruginous Pochard, Eurasian Wigeons, Garganeys, Greylag Goose, Bar-headed Goose, the Brown-headed and Black-headed Gulls and Common Coot.”

As for special sightings this year, he says, “Generally the Common Coot is black in colour and last year we had a white Coot visitor which has come back this year too. However, the Baikal Teal, which comes from Afghanistan and only one of its kind visited this sanctuary last year, has not come this time at all.” He adds that the sanctuary authorities are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the beautiful Flamingos which come from the Great Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. “Ideally, around this time they should be on their way to Delhi,” he adds.

However, many birdwatchers are worried that the number of migratory birds visiting the Okhla Sanctuary is declining each year due to various reasons. Nikhil Devasar, a bird enthusiast and member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society says, “I have been seeing the turnout of migratory birds here. Sadly it’s dropping by almost 30 per cent each year, and this is in spite of the good winters. The reason behind this, I feel, is global warming. Temperatures are rising in traditionally cold regions in Europe and Siberia and there is little snowfall there these days. As a result, birds don’t feel the need to migrate.”

Bird conservationist Anand Arya is unhappy with the management of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. He says, “The sanctuary has become very dirty. Firstly it needs to be cleaned up. The construction work and felling a large number of trees, have taken away insects which form a huge source of food for terrestrial migratory birds. The overhead cables are also driving the birds away.”

He concludes, “If we want these seasonal guests to keep coming, the authorities must keep their habitats ready to welcome them.”
