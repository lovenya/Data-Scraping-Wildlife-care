Presenting the Budget for 2023-24, Tamil Nadu Finance Minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Monday said the DMK government has brought down the state’s revenue deficit from 3.28 per cent in 2020-21 to 1.23 per cent of the GSDP in 2022-2023, close to the ratio of 2015-2016 through “reforms of unprecedented scale and scope” in the last two years.ADVERTISEMENTThe state’s revenue deficit, which has been on the rise during the AIADMK government, has also been brought down to Rs 30,476.01 crore in the revised estimates compared to Rs 52,781 crore in the budget estimates for the 2022-2023 fiscal. The fiscal deficit reduction after the DMK assumed office in May 2021 stood at Rs 31,850, with Thiaga Rajan terming it as an “unprecedented feat” as the DMK dispensation inherited an annual deficit of Rs 62,000 crore.However, the total outstanding debt will increase to 7.26 lakh crore as on March 2024 as against the Rs 6.53 lakh crore as on March 2023 as the net public debt for the incoming financial year is projected at Rs 91,866.14 crore.

The DMK, while in opposition, had blamed the previous AIADMK government of “mismanaging” the state’s finances and promised to set things right once it came to power. In his two-hour long speech, Thiaga Rajan said the main reason for the fiscal stress faced by the Government at the time of assuming office was the fall in tax revenue in the previous years. “The state’s own tax revenues which were at a healthy 8 percent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) during 2006-11 have witnessed a precipitous fall in the last 10 years and reached 5.58 per cent in 2020-21,” he said, adding that this is much lower when compared to other large States such as Maharashtra and Karnataka. Though the Tax-GSDP ratio has increased to 6.11 per cent in the current year due to the efforts of the DMK Government in the last two years, concerted action is needed to raise it further to find financial resources for welfare schemes, he added.The second full-fledged budget of the DMK government laid much focus on infrastructure, development of women, girl students, education, and children, and environment, besides other sectors. Thiaga Rajan announced that the scheme to provide Rs 1,000 as monthly assistance to women heads of “eligible” households will be rolled out on September 15. The ”rightful money” is a major poll promise of the DMK. However, the document didn’t speak about other promises like reduction in the price of diesel and subsidy for LPG cylinders.
