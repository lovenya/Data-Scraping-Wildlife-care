Bachelors of Science in pure science subjects, maths and bio-technology might be the first options that one is given quite often after completing Pre University. For someone who feels investigation and solving crime cases is their cup of tea, adegree and post graduation in Forensic science could be an interesting option.ADVERTISEMENTA three year BSc course in Jain University would have a package of interesting topics such as crimes and investigations, managing crime scenes, various sections of the Indian law, question document examination, wildlife forensics, finger prints and DNA analysis. Working hand in hand with the police round the clock so as to help resolve crime cases would be taught as a part of the same course.Any student with a science background, Biology in particular can apply for the course after Pre-University. A separate entrance exam will decide the eligibility factor for the same.Students with good knowledge about human anatomy and biology are preferred for the same.Presently, 100 students have taken up both the undergraduate (BSc) and post graduate (MSc) course in the stream. S Sujayraj, Assistant Professor, Jain University says that better posts would be offered to those with a post graduate degree.Even as the career opportunities are plenty and jobs are available in abundance, the number of Universities offering the course are a handful. Apart from Jain University, there is another University at Hyderabad and Amity University that offer the course.Sujayraj explained that the students would be eligible for jobs in the State and Central Forensic Science Labs, Central Bureau of Investigation and other units. They could also work as Private detectives with various private set ups.“For someone who has completed BSc, the would be offered the Lab Assistant’s posts. Those who have studied further would be recruited as Assistant forensic experts in these labs,” he said.From collecting crucial evidence from the scene of crime to analysing the same, the need for forensic science experts is evident. “ Offering a wide range of opportunities in both private and government sectors, there is a lot of scope for the same,” Sujayraj added.Sujayraj explained that students, as a part of the course would be trained to collect evidence from the spot, analyse the same in laborateries and submit reports.“There are 100 students in the present batch who have completed the course and are ready for recruitment.
