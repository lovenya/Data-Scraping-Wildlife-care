The herd of eight elephants, which had ventured close to the city on Monday and Tuesday, were successfully driven off towards Omkar forest range early Thursday morning.

ADVERTISEMENTThe elephants had created quite a scare among the residents of the city and anxious moments for the personnel of the Forest and Wildlife departments, who were part of the operation to drive the elephants back into the forest.

Deputy Conservator of Forests S D Gaonkar told this newspaper that the elephants reached the fringes of Omkar forest range around 3 am on Thursday. The Forest department personnel, with help of trackers, were involved in the operation through the night, he said.

Fringe area

“The elephants are now in the fringe area of the range, which is part of Bandipur Tiger Reserve. Officials of the reserve will now ensure that the elephants do not venture out again,” he said.

Forest Minister Ramanath Rai told the Legislative Council in Belgaum on Thursday that forest personnel spotted the tiger a few metres away from the place where it had claimed Shivamalla Basappa, its last victim.

‘Joint effort’

The beast was captured after tranquilising it. He attributed the success of the operation to the joint efforts by the police and Forest department personnel. The minister sought special permission from the chairperson of the Council to break the news.
