There is a sharp decline in tourists from different parts of the globe. But, it has at least one positive effect. The migratory birds from different parts of the world have never stopped coming to Kashmir’s wetlands in winters. The numbers seem to be growing by the year in Kashmir.   

This winter, already over eight lakh such birds have reached the wetlands and the number is expected to cross over 10 lakh by the beginning of January. This will be an all-time record of the birds’ arrival in Kashmir.

Khurshid Ahmad, an official in wildlife protection department, keeps a close watch on these migratory birds in one of the wetlands. “The migratory birds start arriving in November and their number peaks in December. They begin leaving in mid-February,” he said.

Khurshid said the arrival of migratory birds in such a big number this winter is a pleasant development.”Tourists almost stopped coming to Kashmir this year due to the five-month-long civil unrest, marked by strikes, curfew, protests and killings. People involved in tourism sector suffered a body blow. While, the arrival of migratory birds does not help the state economy but it is an indicator that Kashmir has not lost attraction and there is a better hope for future also,” he said.

The government employee sounded optimistic when he said there was a record arrival of migratory birds this winter and hopefully, tourists will arrive in droves during the coming year.

Khurshid’s colleague, Tanveer Ahmad, said the migratory birds are enjoying the peaceful atmosphere at Kashmir wetlands. “The poaching has come to an end. The anti-poaching law is strictly being implemented. Earlier in early 1990s because of the turmoil, the arrival of migratory birds had decreased due to poaching. Now there is no such threat to them,” he said.

Following intense cold, the wetlands in Kashmir started freezing causing food problems for the migratory birds. But employees of the Wildlife Department break ice everyday to ensure that the birds get food. Even alternative food is made available to them.

There were apprehensions that the birds might fly to other places due to freezing cold and the food shortage. But, the experts here said no such situation has arisen yet.
The main wetlands in Kashmir include Hokersar, Wullar, Shalbug, Mirgund, Hygam and Dal Lake.

Freezing temperature

The migratory birds to Kashmir wetlands are Tufted Duck, Garganey, Grayland Goose, Brahminy Duck, Northern Pintail, Mallard, Common Merganser, Common Pochard, Ferruginous Pochard, Red Crested Pochard, Rudy Shelduck and Northern Shoveler.

According to experts, the migratory birds reach here mainly from Siberia, north Europe China, Afghanistan and Central Asia.

The birds migrate from there due to the freezing temperature which dips to even minus 30 to 40 degree Celsius, blocking their feeding sources.

Some of the migratory birds can be seen flying to populated areas near to wetlands during daytime. A few can be spotted at the Sher-e-Kashmir cricket stadium in Srinagar during daytime. As no cricket-related activity is on in the stadium in the winter, the birds are not get disturbed. Located near the famous Shankarachara Hill, Dal Lake and the river Jehlum, the cricket stadium  hosted only two  one-day international  matches  during 1980s.  India lost both the matches-one against West Indies and another against Australia.

After the eruption of militancy since 1990, no match  was possible in the stadium.
The presence of migratory birds in the stadium does attract public attention.”  It is good to see them. If we can not see  cricketers in action there, at least we can see the migratory birds,” said Zahid, a Burn Hal school student.

Restrictions on visitors

The birds can also be seen sometimes at the Emporium Garden area. People from different areas visit these wetlands  to have a look at these birds. They are not allowed by the authorities there to go nearer.

As the migratory birds are arriving in record number, the condition at wetlands needs improvement. Years of encroachment and silt are resulting in the shrinking of wetlands. As per the data, the area of Mirgund Wetland has shrunk by 50 per cent to two sq km. 
From 13.75 sq km, the Hokersar has been reduced to only five sq km. The area of Shalbugh has shrunk from 16 sq km to seven sq km, Haigam from 14 sq km to five sq km.
Toufiq Mohammad, an officer of the Wildlife Protection Department, said the wetlands were shrinking because of excessive silt and encroachment.

He added now encroachment had stopped because of the tough measures by the government. “In the past, some vested interests took undue advantage of the turmoil and encroached upon the wetlands. But right now we are not allowing this  to happen,” he said. According to experts, the area lost due to silt, can be cleared through proper planning and management.

The government officials claim that efforts are being made to tackle this problem. 
“This problem was not addressed till date. A strategy is being evolved to stop further shrinking of wetlands because of silt and regaining the lost area,” Toufiq said.

Mohammad Jawad, a business man, said the state government must take seriously the shrinking of wetlands. “If the wetlands are allowed to shrink, the migratory would stop coming to Kashmir. The encroachment and silt are bound to adversely affect the environment in Valley and this tendency can pose threat to the very existence of wetlands,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT
