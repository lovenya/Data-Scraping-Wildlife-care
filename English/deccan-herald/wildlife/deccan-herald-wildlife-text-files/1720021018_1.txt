“Every person should plant at least one sapling and nurture it into a tree. All should gradually reduce the use of plastics as the material is proving fatal for our environment,” said assistant general manager of National Bank for Rural Development Bindhumadhava Vadavi.

Stating that nature can thrive without the help of man, but man cannot be independent of his environment, he said human beings have become greedy and are exploiting all resources as if they are meant only for them.

Vadavi said destruction of forests would result in ecological imbalance and extinction of various living beings, which would directly affect the existence of human beings. 

“When synthesised for the first time, plastics seemed like a boon. But it has actually turned into a bane. The youth should educate their family members, relatives and friends about the ills of indiscriminate use of plastics and urge them to minimise its use,” he said.

Range forest officer Anupama said civilisation started in forests but now people are neglecting forests and destroying them. “There should be at least 33 per cent forest on land for balance of life. But there is not even two per cent forest cover in Mandya district. Experts always say we are threatening the existence of forests and wildlife, but we are actually destructing ourselves,” she said.

Casualties

“Reports about forests and wildlife getting destroyed in floods and earthquakes are rare. Human beings suffer highest casualties in all natural calamities. If we do not realise the dangers of imbalance, there is no future,” Anupama warned.

Senior environmental officer of KSPCB Lakshman and district environmental officer B C Prakash introduced the 70 participants of the eco-walk to various flora and fauna in the 60 hectare area of the biodiversity park. 

They visited ‘Mishrajathi vana’, ‘Phalothphanna vana’, ‘Sampige vana’, ‘Ashoka vana’, ‘Ale vana’, ‘Urvashi vana’, ‘Karka vana’, ‘Triphala vana’, ‘Mandara vana’, Holedasavala vana’, ‘Srigandha vana’, ‘Dry Deciduous vana’, ‘Delinia Indicana vana’, ‘Kanigale vana’, ‘Jathropa vana’, ‘Ficus vana’, ‘Thavare kola’, ‘Saptharshi vana’ ‘Mallige vana’, etc and observed 14,304 species. 

The participants walked a distance of five km on the Bangalore-Mysore highway to enter Cauvery river, where resource persons explained to them about the importance of water and water bodies to maintain ecological balance. They trekked up to the top of Karigatta and studied various plants and trees on the hillock.

President of Parisara Mangala Yogish, lecturers Thirthakumar, Suresh Kumar and Gopinath, and youth leader C M Dyavappa were present on the occasion.
