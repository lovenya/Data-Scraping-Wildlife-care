Having reached Dandeli by an overnight bus, my first visit was to the office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Sunil Panwar, who arranged for my treks and stay at nature camps. 

Quickly boarding a mofussil bus, I headed for the nature camp at Anshi, some 37 km away. The last 15-km stretch was the worst ever with the vehicle tossing up and down over a never-ending series of craters and potholes. The camp is three km into the forest. The nature camp at Anshi, maintained by the forest department, is easily the best camping option located in the middle of a dense jungle with beautifully laid out tented accommodation and a central dining place called the ‘Peacock’. 

Anshi nature camp is the base for four treks into the forest with different levels of arduousness. My choice was the hardest of them all; a one-day climb to the Kadra viewpoint and back involving a trek of about 20 km. As we  took the Anshi road for a kilometer, one could feel the mild chill of the forest. Anshi National Park, spread over 340 sq km, was carved out of the larger Dandeli wildlife sanctuary in 1987, both of which now constitute the Dandeli-Anshi Tiger Reserve (DATR). The densely wooded tropical evergreen forests here are not only rich in wildlife, but support a great variety of birds especially the hornbills. ADVERTISEMENTEven as the path drifted into the jungle, a racket-tailed drongo flew across with its pair of long feathers trailing behind gracefully. Though the area abounds in avian species, it is difficult to spot them when on a trek. We crossed fields and forests alternately bypassing the upper Matagaon village to our left. At lower Matagaon are a few huts beyond which the path came to a fork. We followed the trail to the right towards Dongriwada. The moderate climb brought us to a lonely hut. Resting for a while and resuming the trek further up, we came to a jeep track in disuse going southward. There must have been a temple here some time as we found an image of the deity Lakshmi lying on the ground. 

We crossed several streams, thinly running or completely dry as the route led to a place called Maradihalla with a watch tower. From here on, the gradient increased. The forest canopy was so thick that hardly any light reached the ground. The cool and shady path made it possible to overcome the steepness. At the top of the hill, we were greeted by a stupendous view. The blue reservoir shone like a turquoise jewel surrounded by the green valley. It was the most pleasant sight after a strenuous climb. The viewpoint is barricaded to prevent visitors from stepping into the depths of the valley. A paragola here served as the resting and viewing platform.  

A narrow path from here descended through the forest. The descent was not easy as the fallen leaves and twigs made it slippery. The five-km trek back brought us to a stream just ahead of the road. From here, the hill top where we were an hour earlier, looked high in the sky. Taking a closer look at the blue reservoir, we trekked another three km to the township of Kadra to board a bus back to the camp.  

Getting there

Anshi nature camp is located 37 km from Dandeli on Karwar road and is connected by buses. Karwar, 60 km west, is the nearest railway station. For stay at the camp and trekking, permission from the DCF (wildlife), Dandeli is required.
