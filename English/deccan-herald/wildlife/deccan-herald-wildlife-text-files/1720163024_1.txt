Animal rights activists have rescued two pangolins from the outskirts of the City in the last ten days. The People for Animals (PFA) volunteers rescued a pangolin on the night of March 13 from a poultry farm in Kumbalgod. The animal was being attacked by a snake. The pangolin was hurt by the snake and has bite marks, said Navin Kumar, public relations officer, PFA.Â  

ADVERTISEMENTOn March 6, the other pangolin was rescued from a government school at Kumbarahalli village in Hessaraghatta. The endangered animal was spotted at the anganwadi section. Both the pangolins are under observation at the PFA shelter in Kengeri. The snake that had attacked the pangolin has been released into the Turahalli Reserve Forest.

Pangolins, also called the scaly animals because of the scales on their body, are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. They are being illegally hunted down on the outskirts of the City for its meat, skin and scales.

The animal, which was once found in large numbers on the outskirts of the City, has reduced in numbers because of urbanisation and lack of conducive habitats, Kumar added.
