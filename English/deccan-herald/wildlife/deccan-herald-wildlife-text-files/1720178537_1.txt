Several prominent citizens, most of them retired higher officials of the state government, are opposing the formation of the four-lane Mysuru-Madikeri National Highway 275, in the present form, as it affects the ecology, including Ranganathittu bird sanctuary in Srirangapatna, Mandya district.ADVERTISEMENTRetired Additional Deputy Commissioner H T Chandrasekhar, one of the signatories of the petition to the Chief Engineer of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), said, “The proposed project will cause extensive and irreparable damage to the agricultural fields in Mandya and Mysuru districts, Western Ghats of Kodagu district, i.e., ranges of Bramhagiri and Pushpagiri hills, which have been declared as one of the ‘World Heritage Rain Forests’.”Retired Deputy Conservator of Forests M B Srinivas said, “The damage to Western Ghats will badly affect the origin and also basin of Cauvery River, the lifeline of southern Karnataka, including Bengaluru.”Chandrasekhar said, the project will be a blow to wildlife, as the proposed highway would pass through agricultural fields, forests and also amid Ranganathittu bird sanctuary.”Letter to modify Following the petition, the Chief Engineer of NHAI has written a letter to the Chief General Manager of NHAI, on October 15, 2019, requesting to modify the formation of the highway.As per the plan, the Madikeri Highway would be connected from Srirangapatna, via Bommuru Agrahara, Avverahalli, Balamuri, Beechankuppe, Karimanti, Kempalingapura, Palahalli and Belagola, bypassing Mysuru.Srinivas said that road users can drive up to Ring Road towards Mysuru and take a right at Columbia Asia junction to join the Madikeri Highway, without entering Mysuru city. “For preserving the ecology, there is no harm in the vehicles travelling a bit more.
