Coorg Wildlife Society President Colonel (retd) C P Mutthanna has challenged the BJP leaders to prove the allegations they have made against the Congress of using foreign funds received by fake environmentalists for election campaign.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing media persons on Tuesday, he criticised the BJP leaders for making false allegations against the environmentalists who are trying their best to protect and preserve land, water and natural resources of the district. The environmentalists are simply portrayed as villains. 

“Let Manu Mutthappa stop making baseless allegations. Why didn’t the BJP government which was in power take up an investigation into foreign funds that arrive to the State. Why was the issue not discussed so far, but raised only when the election has approached?” he asked.

Deforestation concern

Mutthanna questioned the mentality of not speaking against several issues in the district including hydel power projects, high-tension wires, illegal sand mining, expansion of Madikeri city etc. 

If all these projects are implemented it would lead to massive deforestation. If the high-tension wire is laid from Kaiga to Thalasherry via Kodagu, it would lead to the chopping of 15000 trees. 

The issue has been brought to the notice of the State Chief Secretary. If the government fails to take action, then the next option would be to approach the court, he said.

Illegal sand mining

Coorg Wildlife Society Vice President B A Poonacha expressed concern over the damage caused to rivers due to illegal sand mining on the banks of river Cauvery and Lakshman Theertha. If the illegal mining is not stopped now, there would be difficulty in supplying water to Bangalore and Mysore, he said.
