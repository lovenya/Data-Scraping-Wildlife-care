The SGNP tiger pair - Bajrang and Durga, aged six and three, would now be residents of SZP.The exchange was okayed by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA).Now, there’s only one 11-year-old male lion left in the SGNP which has been kept isolated owing to age-related problems.In September, Maharashtra Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar went to Ahmedabad during which he met his Gujarat counterpart Jagdish Vishwakarma and finalised the agreement.
