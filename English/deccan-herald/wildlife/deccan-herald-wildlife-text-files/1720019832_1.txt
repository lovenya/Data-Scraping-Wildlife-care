Vishwa (18), a final year ITI student in Tarikere Government College, was on his way home when the leopards attacked him and dragged him 50 feet into the forest. The big cats also attacked Soma, Vishwaâ€™s brother, who went in search of his sibling, when the latter did not return home in the evening. Soma, however, managed to escape and alerted the residents who scared the animals away.

The leopards had also attacked another man, Subrahmanya, who has been admitted to Mcgann Hospital in Shimoga. Agitated over the Forest department staff not visiting the spot, farmers set on fire a four-wheeler belonging to the department.ADVERTISEMENT
