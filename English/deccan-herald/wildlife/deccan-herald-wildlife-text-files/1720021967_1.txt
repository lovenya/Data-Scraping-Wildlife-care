The Giraffe Centre, near Nairobi’s Langata suburb, Kenya, is fast becoming famous as a centre for conserving the endangered Rothschild giraffe. Its 115-acre sanctuary is home for about 10 giraffes of various ages. The Rothschild giraffes are different from the Masai giraffes for the patterns on the skin.

That was the beginning of the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife (AFEW), Kenya, with its avowed objectives of conserving the endangered Rothschild giraffe as well as serving as an educational institution.

Visitors have a chance to meet the tallest living creatures, the giraffes, in their natural environment, not like a zoo, and get close to these gentle animals. The thrill is to feed these animals with grass and food pellets while observing the animal at close quarters. There are plenty of photo opportunities during such interactions. The giraffes have a free run in the large sanctuary.

An entry fee, equivalent to that of Rs 500, supports the work of the sanctuary, as it receives no government aid or grant. It has an observation deck where food could be offered to the giraffes, while one can get an idea of the sprawling forest that is the natural habitat of the giraffes. It has a small café serving snacks and soft drinks.
 
I was introduced to Alice and Helen, two young female giraffes which were friendly and had no hesitation in accepting my offer of grass. The Giraffe Centre also organises workshops for children of all ages in giraffe conservation as well as other environmental issues of interest. The AFEW (Kenya) supports other organisations like Wildlife Clubs of Kenya, Friends of Nairobi National Park, and Mount Kenya Forest Trust. The Giraffe Centre maintains a nature trail to give visitors an idea of the forest and its inmates, where one can spot giraffes and warthogs as well as many varieties of birds. Experienced and informed guides take the visitors on the nature trail, which is interesting, educative and thrilling. 

Breeding is controlled to prevent inbreeding. Moreover, once the giraffe-calves reach the age of about three months, they are transferred to natural wildlife sanctuaries like the Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where giraffes are present in the wild. Observers monitor how these relocated giraffes have adapted to the natural surroundings so that those who have problems can be taken care of.
