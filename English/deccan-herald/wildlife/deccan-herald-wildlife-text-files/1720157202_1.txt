The forest department officials in Dakshina Kannada district took away wild animals being reared at Kalladka Vidya Kendra run by RSS leader Dr K Prabhakar Bhat, on Friday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe school management was rearing deer, antelope, monkey, python and peacock among others animals and birds in separate cages, without obtaining permission from the department concerned. All the animals have been transported to Pilikula zoo.

School Convener B Narayana Somayaji said that the school management was rearing a couple of wild animals which were found wounded or injured. 

“We had requested the forest department to take away the animals. The officials who were supposed to take away the animals on Thursday could not take them owing to non availaibility of vehicles. Hence, they took them on Friday,” he said.

DFO speaks

Speaking to Deccan Herald, DFO Palayya said that though Bhat had sought permission for opening an animal rescue centre a few months ago, the department is yet to grant permission. 

Hence, Bhat had requested the department to take away the animals as rearing wild animals (Schedule 1) is an offence under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
