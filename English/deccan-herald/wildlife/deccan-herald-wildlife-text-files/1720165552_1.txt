The Gujarat government has rejected the allegations of wrong doing in sale of land to private firm supposed to have links with Chief Minister Anandiben Patel’s daughter Anar Patel as ‘figment of imagination’.

ADVERTISEMENT The state said this in its affidavit to the Gujarat High Court on Wednesday. The state filed the affidavit before a division bench of Chief Justice R Subhash Reddy and Justice Anant Dave in response to a public interest ligitation filed by an NGO RTI Activists Sangathan. The state government said that the decision to allot 99 hectares of land was bona fide and as per the policies of the state government to promote tourism in the state. “It is a figment of imagination of the petitioner that the officers of the respondent departments have perpetrated fraud in the allotment of land,” the affidavit read. 

It also gave details of the procedure followed to arrive at the pricing for the said allotment. The state government pleaded that the land was allotted to Wildwoods Resort & Realities Pvt. Ltd (WRRPL) following an MoU between the state tourism department and the company on January 12, 2009, to establish a wildlife resort with a proposed investment of Rs 80 crore.  

As per the details of the case, the state land at Patla village in Amreli district was allotted to WRRPL at a concessional rate of Rs 15 per square metre, as against the actual valuation of Rs 180 per square metre.
