An ode to nature

In ‘Natural World’, which airs on April 19 on Animal Planet at 8 pm, master cinematographers explore the beauty of Nature and the wildlife using high quality photography and some unforgettable close-ups. 

The concept behind the programme is to profile Nature, from the serene to the sublime, in a way that is normally not seen by the naked eye.

Affairs to remember

Watch ‘The French Lieutenant’s Woman’ on April 19 on MGM Channel at 3.15 pm.

The film, directed by Karel Reisz and adapted by playwright Harold Pinter, is based on John Fowles’ story of a nineteenth century Englishwoman named Sara (essayed by Meryl Streep). 

Sara is ruined by an affair with a French lieutenant. As soon as she gets out of it, she rushes headlong into another affair with the highly principled young Charles (played by Jeremy Irons). 

The film also stars Hilton McRae, Emily Morgan and Charlotte Mitchell. ADVERTISEMENTGoing beyond the mind  

See the latest episode of ‘Hannibal’ on April 19 on AXN at 10 pm. The hour-long drama explores the budding relationship of psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter and his patient – the gifted FBI criminal profiler, Will Graham.
