Two persons including a 7-year-old boy have been killed by the reptiles since May 18. The breeding season of salt water crocodiles is now picking up. "Disturbed over human interference in waterbodies, the crocodiles have turned violent," said officials.

"We have cautioned the riverside villagers not to venture into water. Alert has been sounded in a number of villages in and around Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary", said Rajnagar mangrove and wildlife DFO, Prasanna Kumar Behera.

Apart from crocodile conservation programme, the safety of human lives and livestock remains on the top of forest departments agenda, he said.

Besides engaging a service group of skilled fishermen, the department has pressed into service three country boats in crocodile-infested river to keep the animals at bay.
The job of the fishermen is to chase the straying crocodiles to their original habitat in Bhitarkanika river system, said official sources.ADVERTISEMENT
