Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Moin-ul-Hassan (CPI-M) said the RTI activist was killed on a day when lakhs of people in the country were out in the streets protesting corruption.

Hassan said at least 10 RTI activists were killed in various parts of the country last year and drew the attention of the government towards the "urgent need" to provide security to the whistleblowers.

He said the purpose of the RTI Act will lose its relevance if the killings of the whistleblowers continued.

Hassan said the Bhopal police was of the view that Masood's campaign for wild life protection and conservation might have hurt certain sections that led to her killing.
The CPI-M member said while RTI Act was to ensure that people have a right to information, the RTI activists are getting killed.

Shehla was found shot dead inside her car in front of her house in the Koh-e-Fiza locality in Bhopal on August 16. She had gone on fast recently in support of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption campaign.

She was also involved in other cases, including wildlife conservation, and the issue of deaths of tigers in sanctuaries in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh. The Congress has demanded a CBI probe into the issue.ADVERTISEMENT
