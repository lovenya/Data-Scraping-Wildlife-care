The carcass of a nine-month-old female elephant calf was found at Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary on Wednesday. 

Forest department personnel who were on a patrol at Chennuru Beat, found the carcass and informed the higher-ups.

According to Forest personnel, the calf might have died two days ago due to starvation. Assistant Conservator of Forest Ankaraju and RFO Lokesh Murthy visited the spot.

Personnel suspect that the 30-year-old female elephant that had died due to starvation on March 16 might be the mother of the calf. Veterinarian Dr Shivaraju conducted the post-mortem.
