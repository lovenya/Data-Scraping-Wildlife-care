Various organisations have opposed the move of Madikeri Urban Development Authority (MUDA) to expand Madikeri town by including villages in and around Madikeri. 

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing a press meet here on Monday, Coorg Wildlife Society Vice-President Poonaccha said the expansion of Madikeri town will destroy greenery in Madikeri. The hillocks will be damaged. Destruction of forest in the name of expansion will affect rain pattern in the district. 

“Mysore, Bangalore, Tamil Nadu and Kerala will get water only when Kodagu receives good rainfall. Scanty rainfall will affect the supply of drinking water,” he added. 

Madikeri Kodava Samaja President Suresh Changappa said that the MUDA should not take the decision in a hurry. It should consult the experts and citizens before coming to a conclusion. 

Kodagu Muslim Hitharakshana Vedike member Mohisin said “We are not against development. However, the expasion of the town will harm environment. The proposal should be dropped.” 

Field Marshal Cariappa General Thimmaiah Forum office-bearer Maj (retd) B A Nanjappa said there is a need for time to discuss the issue. The decision should be taken either in the month of March or April. 

Stating that the Madikeri comes under eco sensitive zone, Cauvery Sene convener Ravi Chengappa said that the forests are known for its flora and fauna. The expansion of the town will destroy the eco-system. 

As many as 15 organisations are opposing the move. If MUDA fails to withdraw the move, then protest will be held. 

In a separate press meet, Save Kodagu Forum President Madhu Bopanna said that if the project is implemented, then many residents will be evicted. The move of the MUDA will benefit hotel and resort owners.
