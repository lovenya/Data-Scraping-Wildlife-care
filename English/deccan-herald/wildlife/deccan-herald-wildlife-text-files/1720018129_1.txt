The State Department of Forests, which on record had declared the entire 872.24 sq km area of the tiger reserve CCH in December 2006, has now suddenly woken up to implement it in letter and spirit. 

The inordinate delay in implementing the rules under CCH is due to delay in preparing an action plan. On an average, at least 1,000 people visit the park daily, and the footfalls are growing at seven per cent annually, according to a study. 

The department has begun to act after the national park was identified as a crucial tiger area in the country and to ensure that the region is freed of human interference including tourism. The department has decided to shift the entire tourism block of Bandipur on NH 67.

Guest house to be retained

The block will now be shifted to Melakamanahalli at the entrance of Bandipur connecting Gundlupet, about 14 km away from the existing tourism block. 

Some of the dormitories, interpretation centres and management centre will be either pulled down or used for anti-depredation activities, said an officer who preferred anonymity. A lone guesthouse will be retained for use of officers during emergency.

As part of the implementation of the CCH, the staff quarters at Bandipur will also be moved out to a newly constructed block at Melakamanahalli and thus the park will be devoid of human activity.

The declaration as CCH was made by the State as per the provisions under Section 38 (V) of Wildlife Protection Act 1972, which recommend that human interference should be stopped in phases. 

“For any notification or non-forest activities in this region, the State now will have to get permission from National Tiger Conservation Authority,” says Sanjay Gubbi, a wildlife expert from Wildlife Conservation Society.

Though the CCH suggests stringent norms like realignment of roads, relocation of tribal population or villagers, if any, within the forest area, the forest department says that since the relocation of people from the forest happened several decades ago, the biggest task before them now is to ensure dependency on fuel wood by dwellers around the fringes of the park is reduced and prevention of grazing of livestock. The park is surrounded by 230 villages and the residents are dependent on forest for their daily needs. 

Officials said the distribution of cooking gas to villagers is almost complete and a massive programme to vaccinate the livestock is in full swing.ADVERTISEMENT
