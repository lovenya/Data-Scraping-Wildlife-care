Aamir Khan is my all-time favourite. His films like ‘Dangal’, ‘PK’ and ‘Taare Zameen Par’ let us take away something, unlike other mundane entertainers. Other than that, my all-time favourite film will be Kamal Haasan’s ‘Sagara Sanganam’; I cry every time I watch it. I also watch many Hollywood films.”<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2Fmallalli-falls-coorg-tourism-entry-fee-timings-holidays-reviews-header%20(1).jpg?w=1200" alt="Kodagu"/>KodaguTravelKodagu“I go on a lot of family vacations, apart from travelling for work. Chile in South America and Tanzania in Africa are the two places I admire. I like Chile for its natural beauty and its balance of mountains and beaches. I like Africa for its connect with wildlife. In India, I like visiting Kerala often. Taking a break and unwinding and relaxing on a houseboat makes me feel great. For a quick weekend getaway, I choose Kodagu.”<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg?w=1200" alt="Voleti Venkateswarulu"/>Voleti VenkateswaruluMusicVoleti Venkateswarulu“I listen to a mix of Carnatic and Hindustani music. Voleti Venkateswarulu is my favourite musician. He sings traditional Carnatic music with traces of Hindustani; I try to incorporate this in my own renditions. Recently, I am hooked to the band ‘Agam’. Their renditions of classical music with new flavours is refreshing. I also love AR Rahman’s compositions; classical music with a touch of modern sound.”BooksGone with the wind“ I used to be a voracious leader back in the days. ‘Gone with the wind’ by Margaret Mitchell is my all-time favourite. I also used to read Salman Rushdie while growing up. If I was in a mood for some murder mysteries, I would turn to Agatha Christie.”FoodDark chocolate“I am a foodie. An ideal day for me would have a nice South Indian spread like Rava Idli or Set Dosa for breakfast, Italian for lunch and Mediterranean cuisine for dinner. For a good mid-morning meal, I prefer pasta with pesto. Since I have a big sweet tooth, I like munching on some dark chocolates. Dark chocolate with orange flavour is a classic combination; I like the bitter taste.”
