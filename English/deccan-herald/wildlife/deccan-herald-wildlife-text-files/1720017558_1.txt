Hearing a petition filed by K G Sridhara and others, the Division Bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice A S Bopanna directed the committee comprising Reddy, two MPM officers and an official each from the State and the Centre to conduct a meeting and file a report by March 29.

The court directed the authorities to conduct meetings on March 1, 8 and March 15 and arrive at suggestions.

Earlier, the petitioners had submitted that the company had subleased thousands of acres of land to a foreign firm. They said it was not right on the part of the company to squat around on government land, and demanded that it be surrendered.

When the company submitted that the land was degraded forest land, the petitioners responded that no such word as “degraded land” existed.

The company submitted that former forest officer Reddy would suggest measures for alternative methods to utilise the land in the interest of government and the company.

Case background

The State allotted about 85,000 acres to MPM in 2008 to cultivate raw materials. The land is spread across Shimoga, Chikmagalur and Davangere districts. 

A portion of it — about 25,000 acres of forest (wildlife area) and revenue land — was returned to the State following a High Court order recently.

When the company subleased a portion to a foreign agency, the petitioners moved the High Court seeking the return of the land to the government.

In their submission, they said the land lease was illegal as such a huge portion could not be allotted. The petitioners also submitted that the cultivation of acacia species for paper pulp would adversely impact the biodiversity of the region.
