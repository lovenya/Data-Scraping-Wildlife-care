The birds and animals were shifted to Mysore Zoo in the midnight as any delay would have result in their death. 

Nataraj Rao, an official working at the cargo terminal, heard the sound of the endangered birds and animals around 6 pm and informed his senior officers. Vet Pets, a pet shop located in Shivajinagar had booked the consignment for Delhi. Officials confiscated the creatures after examining the shipment amid protests by the consignor who insisted of ‘possessing all the necessary documents’ and termed the move ‘unjust’.  

No arrest

According to sources, Chief Wildlife Warden’s permission is mandatory for transporting the birds and animals listed as endangered. No person has been arrested in this regard.
