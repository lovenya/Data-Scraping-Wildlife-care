The Forest and Environment department is planning to set up a rescue centre at the Ranthambore National Park in view of the tigers and other wild animals straying out of the park resulting in man-wildlife conflict.

ADVERTISEMENTBeena Kak, minister for forest here on Thursday announced compensation to the victims. She said Rs 20,000 each will be given to the two villagers, Hanuman Prajapat and Badri Lal, who were injured T-20 Tiger attack in Mai Kalan village, Khandar Range of the Ranthambore National Park (RNP) last Tuesday.  

The department would also bear the expenditure incurred on the medical care for injured villagers, the minister added.

The wall around the Park, which is around 6 feet in height, is being further raised. On the top of the wall iron angles will be fixed with barbed wire to make it further difficult for the tigers to move out of the sanctuary. The gaps in the wall will also be repaired, Kak said.

The government is working on a plan to create buffer zones in the peripheries of the Park in view of the growing tiger population in the park.

The plan, that envisages an expenditure of Rs 175 crore, has been sent to the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Planning Commission for approval, the minister said.

Plan finalised

Meanwhile, the forest department has also finalised a plan to develop natural corridors connecting Ranthambore National Park with the neighbouring Kaila Devi sanctuary in Bharatpur district. 

According to the plan 23 villages from Kaila Devi will be relocated outside the forest area while the vacated forest would be protected to develop prey base for the tigers.

Twenty-five tiger cubs have been born in the Park during the last 18 months and will need space to make their own territories as they grow. 

The park also has 26 adult tigers.
