Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Thursday announced a new tiger corridor in Umred that will connect the Tadoba and the Navegaon wildlife sanctuaries in Vidarbha, with the Kanha national park in Madhya Pradesh.

ADVERTISEMENTA release by the Maharashtra Wildlife Board (MWF) said a high level meeting held here also cleared the Centre's request to declare the Kolamarka forest at Sironcha in Gadricholi district a sanctuary for the “critically endangered” wild buffaloes. Less than 50 surviving buffaloes of the breed are found in Uddanti and Sitandi in Chattishgarh, apart from Gadricholi.

The meeting also cleared the decks for the formation of four new sanctuaries - New Bor sanctuary in Wardha, New Nagzira and New Navegaon in Gondia and New Maldhok  in Solapur - spread across 510 square kms.

The MWF statement further pointed out that with the creation of the tiger corridor, the wild cats from Tadoba and Kanha, having genetic similarities, can cross-breed.

The latest tiger census suggests that the state has 180 tigers, with the Tadoba sanctuary, around 20 km from Nagpur, housing 100 of them.

The wildlife board has also decided to sanction Rs 10 lakh package for villagers volunteering to relocate from the reserve areas.
