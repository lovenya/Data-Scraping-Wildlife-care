Amidst the furore over the killing of tigress Avni of Pandharkawada, also known as T1, celebrities slammed the Maharashtra government for adopting a trigger-happy attitude and eliminating her.ADVERTISEMENTActress and activist Raveena Tandon, who is the brand ambassador of Mumbai's Sanjay Gandhi National Park, known for its leopards, criticised the Maharashtra government."Sad day. China has reversed the ban on tiger/rhino products for medicinal uses. While on home ground, despite all efforts, Avni has been shot dead by the hunters, a leopard killed in hit-and-run in Virar. Idiocy reigns. Losing battle for our wildlife in man, politics and animal conflict," she said.Raveena's statement comes as a major embarrassment to the government — as on 25 September, she was appointed SGNP brand ambassador by finance,  planning and forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar — in presence of the top brass of the forest department.Actress, activist and TV presenter Dia Mirza, who is part of various tiger conservation initiatives along with Sanctuary Asia editor Bittu Sahgal, too spoke out. "The way it has gone down, despite the media glare and public outcry, is shocking. Cannot believe they have done this to her.  T1 Avni's murder is unconscionable," she said.Writer, poet and media personality Pritish Nandy said that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis should sack Mungantiwar for the assassination of Avni. "She is not a maneater, just a mother trying to protect her kids," he said.
