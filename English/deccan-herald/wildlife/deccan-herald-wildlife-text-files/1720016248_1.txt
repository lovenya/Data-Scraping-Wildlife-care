Popular as ‘CPK’ among litterateurs, Krishna Kumar cited the example of prolific writer (late) Poornachandra Tejasvi, who had won first prize for his story ‘Lingabandha’ in the competition wayback in 1958. CPK said that ‘if not for the competition, Tejasvi might not have written the particular story’. Reminiscing the words of his teacher Parameshwar Bhat, CPK said ‘Prajavani’ is truly an ‘asthana’ (Court) that has been encouraging the budding talents, besides providing them with remuneration. He drew an analogy between the ‘bhoja’ and ‘Prajavani’. Bhoja Maharaja was feting the scholars in his court with ‘varahas’ (currency in circulation then).

For most, participating and winning prizes in the competitions organised by this particular organisation is still a matter of pride, he added.

Krupakar of the popular wildlife photographers ‘Krupakar-Senani’ duo said it was only through this organisation a writer in them evolved and also became known to the world. It set a perfect platform to hone skills on literature. Senani exhorted ‘Prajavani’ to take the lead and voice for natural resources that has unfortunately became a private property. It assumes significance in the wake of ore being exported to other countries in the name of mining. “While those in mining thrive on ore, the common man is left to gasp with the plume of dust”, said Senani.

CPK and Krupakar-Senani distributed prizes to the winners of story, poetry, painting and photography and ‘Dasara quiz’ contests. Editor, ‘Prajavani’ K N Shanthakumar, associate editor Padmaraj Dandavathi, assistant editor, Lakshman Kodase, general manager, Circulation, Shivaramakrishna and others were present.ADVERTISEMENT
