However, all the activities should be environment friendly. One should see that the development activities do not affect Bababudangiri hill range. 

The software professionals visit hilly region, waterfalls, wildlife sanctuary to spend their weekends. The number of tourists visiting the district is on rise in the recent years. The district administration should not create any new facilities to the tourists which will affect the nature. 

Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust’s D V Girish, Wildcat-C Managing Trust’s Sridev Hulikere, State Wildlife Board member Girija Shankar have urged the authorities to initiate measure against those who carry out illegal activities which are against the nature. 

Bababudanigiri, Inam Dattatreya Peeta, Mullayyanagiri, Kemmannugundi have already been identified in the tourism map of the country. Though there was a demand to widen the road in the region, in the backdrop of the sensitivity of the hilly region, the administration should not take any hasty decision. With the lose soil in the region, there are possibility of caving in of the hillock, if any attempt made to widen the road by cutting the hillocks, they said. 
The available road should be developed. If an attempt made to widen the road, then it will affect Shola forest. 

If roads are widened, then the movement of vehicles throughout the day will affect the wild animals. The tourists who visit the region are not aware of the sensitivity of the region, they said. 

At the same time, the tourist who visit the region litter the place by throwing plastic bags, liquor bottles. The district administration should drop the proposal on new roads to the tourists spots and initiate strict action against those who litter the tourist places.  ADVERTISEMENT
