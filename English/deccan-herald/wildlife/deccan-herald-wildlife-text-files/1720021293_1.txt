Which sport requires the fastest reaction time to survive on the field? What does the perfect athlete look like? How do you figure out the angle of the attack to bend it like Beckham?

Sports Science raises the bar by looking at the sports world through the lens of science. As the show shifts from sports to science, watch how the analysis of motion capture technology can reveal the scientific precision of sport, exploring everything from impact and velocity to aerodynamics. 

So, if you are ever the sports enthusiast, and also have a touch of geek in you, don’t forget to tune in to the latest episode of Discovery Science’s 13-part series, Sports Science on February 8, 8.30 pm.
