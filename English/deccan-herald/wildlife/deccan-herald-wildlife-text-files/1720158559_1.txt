Speaking to media persons, Fernandes said open road construction is a threat to forest and wildlife and no such problems would be faced under the proposed project. It is easier to get environment clearance for the project, he added. 

“Japanese authorities have offered technical as well as financial assistance. But, we have to think about the cost of the project. I want the State and Central governments to participate in this long-term project,” he said. The minister said the project would reduce the travel distance through the ghat from 26.5 km to 18.5 km. On the four-lane project from Kundapur to Talpady,  Fernandes said he had discussed the issue with Tourism Minister R V Deshpande and also sought a detailed report from officials.

Fernandes said it is a technical challenge to reconstruct roads in flood-ravaged Kedarnath. “As the road base has been washed away in the floods, it is a challenge to construct six km of road in the hilly area. I had a discussion with Minister for State for Defence Jitendra Singh and we will be visiting Uttarakand soon. Work is going on at some places and we have offered helicopter services for the workers,” he said.
