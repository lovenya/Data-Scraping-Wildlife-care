ADVERTISEMENTTelevision actress Divyanka Tripathi, better known as Vidya of Banoo Main Teri Dulhan, says she doesn’t want to grow out of the image of a typical Indian woman. “I’m happy with my image of ‘typical Indian woman’. I don't believe in overdoing things,” said the actress. 

The 25-year-old actress said Zee TV’s Cine Star Ki Khoj helped her gain confidence whereas Doordarshan and Aakash Vani gave her due recognition. She gives utmost importance to  family and when asked about her plans of marriage, she said, “I’m in no hurry to get married. When I get married I want everything to be perfect.” Asked about her perfect groom, she replied sheepishly, “I want him to be very supportive and understanding. I’m a very homely person and I would expect him to be the same. I don’t want him to keep me away from my work. And most importantly, I’m not looking out for a macho, Casanova kind of a guy for myself.”

Divyanka also revealed the reason for being away from the screen after Banoo Main Teri Dulhan. “I took a long break to get myself out of the character. I’ve shed enough tears but now is the time to make my viewers smile,” she said.
The actress is now playing the role of Mrs Sharma in Mrs & Mr Sharma Allahabadwale which depicts the journey of a middle-class family instilled with small town values and beliefs with a comical touch.

The winter princess 

Prachi Desai is very excited about her role in Krishan Choudhery’s Main Joker opposite Rajeev Khandelwal. So much so that she braved the icy cold weather of Ooty to shoot for a lori sequence post 1 am wearing only satin. “The song was very soothing and mellifluous,” says Prachi. “But I didn’t realise that it would be so icy cold in the wee hours of the morning.” Nevertheless, as an actor, Prachi feels that the most difficult circumstances only hone your skills. 

“There weren’t retakes. And I was glad when I saw the scene. It came out beautifully.”
