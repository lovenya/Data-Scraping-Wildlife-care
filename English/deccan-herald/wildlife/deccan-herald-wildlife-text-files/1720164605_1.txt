A massive plantation drive has been undertaken in the buffer villages ofÂ  six Tiger reserves spread over Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe tree cover in the Tiger Reserve buffer villages has deteriorated over the years for fuel wood and for making other wood-related items. This prompted Satpuda foundation, the NGO working for wildlife conservation and community development in central India, to undertake the plantation drive. They planted 35 saplings of jamun, sitaphal, sisam, kaju, neem and mango. Students, teachers, community leaders, forest department officials participated in the drive. The Satpuda Foundation team organised and assisted the forest department in implementing a plantation programme. 

The six tiger reserves are Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (Chandrapur), Pench Tiger Re serve (Nagpur), Nawegaon Nagzira TR (Gondia/Bhandara) in Maharashtra, Pench Tiger Reserve (Seoni), Kanha Tiger Reserve (Mandla), and Satpuda Tiger Reserve (Hoshangad) in Madhya Pradesh.
