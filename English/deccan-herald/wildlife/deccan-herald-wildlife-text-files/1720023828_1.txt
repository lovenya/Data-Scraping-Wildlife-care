The Biligiri Rangana Temple Wildlife Sanctuary (BRTWLS) will soon be a plastic-free and alcohol-free zone, said Chief Minister Sadananda Gowda.

ADVERTISEMENTHe was replying to a question by JD(S) member Sandesh Nagaraj seeking proper infrastructure facilities to tourist destinations in Chamarajnagar. 

The government had released Rs one crore in 2007-08 to construct a travellers’ bungalow in the Hills. Gowda added that in 2011, work to provide infrastructure to visitors was undertaken. But since the government could not get clearance from the Forest Department, construction work worth Rs 43 crore had to be taken up by the Forest Department itself. 

Gowda said the Centre had allocated Rs 4.31 crore to provide facilities at Bharachukki Falls and Rs two crore has been earmarked for developing Kukkarahalli lake in Mysore into a tourist attraction. “We have already released Rs 1.5 crore in 2010 and the rest will be released during this year.”
