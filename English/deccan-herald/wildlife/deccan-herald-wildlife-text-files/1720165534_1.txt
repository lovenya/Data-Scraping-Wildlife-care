A farmer was severely injured in a leopard attack at Bommanahalli in the taluk on Tuesday morning. 

ADVERTISEMENTNagaraj Nayak, 45, is being treated for his injuries at the District Hospital here. According to his statement, Nagaraj was working at his field at 8 am on Tuesday, when a leopard suddenly pounced on him and attacked him. Luckily, he was bending forward and the leopard could not lock their jaws on his neck. But he suffered deep bite wounds on his scalp and body. He is said to be out of danger.

The villagers claimed that a herd of elephants had been frequenting the villages under Salagame hobli for the few days and that the Forest department personnel had been chasing them away. With the leopard attacking a farmer at this juncture, the residents are now scared to venture out. The department should take necessary measures to protect them, they said.

Incidents of wild leopards straying into human habitats in several pockets of the State, including the old Mysuru region, Tumakuru, Sandur and Western Ghats, are on the rise in the past few months.

The big cats were sighted on the outskirts of Bengaluru, too, triggering panic among the residents.Â  A leopard had strayed into a Bengaluru school recently, injuring two persons, including Sanjay Gubbi, a wildlife conservationist.
