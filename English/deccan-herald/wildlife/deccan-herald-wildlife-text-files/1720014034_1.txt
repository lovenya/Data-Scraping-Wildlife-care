A passenger who also noticed the reptile emerging out of a bag kept on the luggage rack, screamed in fear, alerting the fellow passengers in the bus. 

As the bus stopped at MUDA traffic signal on JLB road, a man wearing a white T-shirt got off the bus in a hurry and is suspected to be the person to whom the bag containing the boa belonged. 

The bus finally stopped near the Institution of Engineers on the same road, a few yards away from the MUDA circle. Passengers, followed by the driver vacated the bus in a jiffy. Amid the panic, an autorickshaw driver had the wits about him to remove the bag and chuck it on to the footpath. The relieved passengers got on the bus again and resumed their journey. 

As the reptile lay dazed, passersby watched with fear mixed with fascination.Â  Wildlife expert Rajkumar who had summoned by the police, placed the snake in a sack and took it away to be released in the forest.
