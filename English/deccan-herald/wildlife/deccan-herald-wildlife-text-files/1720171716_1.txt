But Mcleodganj is truly different. Being the abode of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, it is kown as ‘Little Lhasa’ or ‘Dhasa’ because a large population of Tibetans lives here. Its culture is a beautiful blend of Tibetan and a bit of British. Named after Sir Donald Friell McLeod, the lieutenant governor of Punjab, Mcleodganj was developed under him which shortly became an attractive place due to its natural beauty. Impressive monasteries having larger than life images of Buddha, Padmasambhava, and Avalokteshwara and the backdrop of the Dhauladhar ranges of mountains will leave you spell-bound. This is nature at its best.Besides, here in markets you get everything authentic from Tibet without actually going there, which needs a visa. The restaurants also offer rich Tibetan flavours.The strenuous trekking route to Triund also starts from McLeodGanj.  <img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2Fwellington%20station.jpg?w=1200" alt="Wellington station"/>Wellington stationWellington Tamil NaduExcept the name, there’s nothing to compare this charming little town with the capital of New Zealand. But Wellington does have charms of its own. The town is near Ooty which is famous as the ‘Queen of Hills’ and is therefore forever crowded with tourists but travel just 35 kilometres further, and you find a secluded wonderland nestled amidst the stunning hills of Nilgiris. The World Heritage Nilgiri Mountain railway chugs silently past this scenic town. It is the only metre gauge, also known as a cog railway or toy train. It passes through many tunnels, and over hundreds of bridges (about 30 of them are large ones). What makes the rail journey spectacularly picturesque is the surrounding rocky terrains, ravines, deep curves, tea plantations, and thickly forested hills. While in the town, you must taste various attractive flavours of tea such as chocolate, cardamom, peppermint and masala tea. Wellington is also known for the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), a premier tri-service training establishment that imparts training to field grade officers of the three wings of the Indian Armed Forces, friendly foreign countries and various Indian Civil Service departments.<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2Ftie%26%20dye%20print%20of%20Barmer.JPG?w=1200" alt="Tie &amp; dye print of Barmer"/>Tie & dye print of BarmerBinsar UttarakhandBinsar is for all — adventure-seekers, bird-watchers, devotees, nature-lovers or wildlife enthusiasts.
