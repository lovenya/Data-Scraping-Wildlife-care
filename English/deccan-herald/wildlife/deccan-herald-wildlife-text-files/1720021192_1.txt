The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has set the target of March 2013 for the completion of these roads which are vital for the speedy transportation of armament, goods and  mobility of troops.

The government is undertaking a total of 27 strategic roads totalling 804 km on the borders with China, officials in the MHA said.

The roads will be constructed in the states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh by the MHA for the operational purposes of the Indo-Tibetan-Border police (ITBP) which guards the China borders.

All these roads are located in a very high altitude area on the India-China border. These areas are generally covered with snow for more than six months. Besides topographical problems, some parts of these roads fall in the reserve forest areas and wildlife sanctuaries.  Therefore, all statutory environmental clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and also the approval of the Supreme Court was taken before giving a go-ahead to the construction of these roads.

Forces guarding the borders — ITBP on the Chinese side and the Border Security Force on the Indo-Bangladesh and Indo-Pakistan borders — have been equipped with hi-tech surveillance equipment like handheld thermal imagers and Long Range Reconnaissance Observation System and other sophisticated means required with the change of weather, sources said.

Besides the China borders, the MHA has also given top priority to the construction of fencing, floodlighting and roads along the Indo-Pakistan and Indo-Bangladesh borders. According to sources, laying of 3,330 km of roads along the Bangladesh border and 2,009 km along the Pakistan borders was completed, sources said.

A project for the construction of 2,840 km of floodlighting on the Indo-Bangladesh border is also underway.ADVERTISEMENT
