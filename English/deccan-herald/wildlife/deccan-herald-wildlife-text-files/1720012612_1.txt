The action-adventure stars Hillary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo and Stanley Tucci. Dr John Keyes makes a startling discovery that the earth’s inner core has stopped rotating, leading to the deterioration of electromagnetic forces. 

If the planet is to be saved, the core of the earth needs a jumpstart, so an elite team is assembled to burrow to the centre of the planet and bomb the insides back to action. 
Joining Keyes on this dangerous, last-chance mission are the brilliant but arrogant Conrad Zimsky, French arms’ expert Serge Leveque, maverick researcher “Brazz” Brazzleton, geeky computer genius Rat, and the two no-nonsense military people, Commander Robert Iverson and Major Rebecca Childs. However, as the crew digs deeper into the earth, they discover what they haven’t been told about their mission and what’s really causing the worldwide chaos.

Miracles of nature

Yellowstone is a nature series, which takes a look at a year in the life of Yellowstone National Park, examining how its wildlife adapts to living in one of the harshest wildernesses on the planet. Stabilised camera enables the team to capture natural animal behaviour from the air as well as dramatic, wide angle landscape shots. 

Watch this spectacular episode shot during the winters when the temperatures plunge to minus 40 degree celsius. With several meters of snowfall, Yellowstone freezes solid for six months each year. In the extreme cold, the moisture in the air freezes. 

Explore how this severe winter is the greatest challenge facing the park’s few animals, but for the wolf, it is the season of opportunity. Yellowstone airs on July 20 at 10 pm on Animal Planet.
