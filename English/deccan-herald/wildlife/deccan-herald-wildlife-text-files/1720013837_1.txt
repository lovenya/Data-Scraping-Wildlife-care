Get ready to laugh out loud with WB’s brand new comedy series — Off Centre, every weeknight at 8 pm. Lighten up your spirits with the adventures of two former Oxford University roommates — English investment banker, Euan (Sean Maguire), and his nerdy American buddy, Mike (Eddie Kaye Thomas) as their mischievous acts land them in a series of comical events that is sure to crack you up!

Mike and Euan are the typical modern-day guys. Mike, the slightly neurotic American whose good intentions are sometimes overshadowed by his sense of morality, is the yin to British Euan's slick, sophisticated and decidedly decadent yang.

Now these two roommates from Oxford are sharing a plush New York apartment as they set out to conquer the world. 

But it isn't long before their contradictory personalities and irksome natures put their seemingly bulletproof friendship to the ultimate test.
