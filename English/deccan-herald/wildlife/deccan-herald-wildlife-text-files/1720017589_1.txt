“It offers me an almost sacred silence,” he said. “This place is a sanctuary for the soul.”

Three years ago, he decided his badminton court had to go to make room for guest cottages so his daughter, Maithili, now 33, and son, Ashim, now 39, could spend more time with him here.


“It was too windy to play anyway,” he said, referring to the persistent sea breeze. 

Ahluwalia, 64, who is divorced from his wife, Jamini, a jewellery designer, built the two-story house as a weekend home in 1990 for $65,000 (he paid $8,800 for the 13-acre property). But he began spending more time here after he retired early from his job as chairman of a marketing research firm in South Asia, in 2004, and bought the organic food company.

Home that embraces its setting
Although the 3,400-square-foot house is on a stretch of coast known as the Hamptons of Mumbai, because of its lavish second homes, to him it represents a longstanding desire to commune with nature, he said.

That is reflected in the home’s design, which embraces its tropical setting. Built on a slope, the home is reached by brick stairs descending from an 1,100-square-foot open veranda with a bamboo roof, an outdoor room that was once a parking area and is now the heart of the home. At one end of the space is a Moroccan-style lounge with colourful rugs and cushions; in the centre is a breakfast area and, on the other end, an antique mahogany desk where Ahluwalia likes to work.

He was determined to embrace nature inside the house as well. The living and dining areas have an unobstructed view of the Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary, where leopards, barking deer and wild boar roam. A century-old cast-iron staircase, found at the Thieves Market, an antiques bazaar in Mumbai, leads down to two bedrooms, one of which is Ahluwalia’s study in the rainy season, and an adjoining bathroom with a giant boulder jutting into it.

(The architect, Nozer Wadia, wanted to demolish the rock, but Ahluwalia objected.)The cottages were designed in collaboration with Isla Van Damme, a family friend who is a consultant for Bungalow 8, the fashion and home furnishings store that Ahluwalia’s daughter owns in Mumbai. They were inspired by the work of Geoffrey Bawa, the Sri Lankan architect known for his modernist aesthetic and use of indigenous materials, and built by Suresh Gund, the housekeeper, with the help of local farmers trained in traditional building methods, for $12,000. 

Air shafts and slatted doors create cross-ventilation, in lieu of air-conditioning, and most building materials were obtained nearby, to reduce the cost of transporting them. Gund made the desk in Maithili Ahluwalia’s cottage out of slate and wood from fallen trees, but other pieces are from her store, which sells reconstructed vintage furniture.

One example is the bed, which has a teak headboard found at a flea market in Mumbai. (Sting, a family friend, slept in it when he visited last year, Ahluwalia said.)To express his gratitude for being able to live surrounded by nature, Ahluwalia said he offers a daily prayer to the sun exactly at sunset: “It’s my way of saying ‘Thank you.”ADVERTISEMENT
