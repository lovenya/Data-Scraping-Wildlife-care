Volunteers at a Beijing dog shelter hand out treats to dozens of rescued animals that had been bound for a controversial dog meat festival underway this week in southern China.ADVERTISEMENTThe annual event in Yulin city always provokes outrage from animal rights activists, but this year they hope the coronavirus epidemic will be the death knell of a tradition they see as cruel.It is "inhumane and barbaric", said Jeffrey Beri, founder of the No Dogs Left Behind organisation, which keeps around 200 canines in large wire enclosures on the outskirts of the Chinese capital and re-homes them.Activists save hundreds of dogs every year by raiding slaughterhouses and intercepting trucks. They say traders steal pets and strays and transport them long distances, mostly to the country's south.

Where will food safety become a reality... Stop this damn festival at once," one user wrote.Experts pointed to a shift in public attitudes towards dog meat consumption and food safety in the wake of the virus.A proposal for China's first nationwide law banning animal cruelty received wide public support during the annual parliamentary session in May, while a viral video of a Chinese university student torturing a cat sparked mass public outcry in April.Chen said neither police nor the government had ordered his restaurant to stop selling dog meat as a result of the animal's reclassification as pets."I would say that (the rule) impacted the rest of the country and people were talking about it, but I did not see it having an immediate impact on the dog meat trade in Yulin," said Peter Li of the animal rights group Humane Society International.Despite the efforts of activists and concerns about hygiene, the Yulin event has persisted with the local government's tacit permission."Most of the activities related to the sale of dog meat there are in violation of existing Chinese food safety regulations," said Deborah Cao, professor of animal law and ethics at Griffith University in Australia.But she said "existing food safety laws in China are not enforced in most instances" and there is "no accountability."
