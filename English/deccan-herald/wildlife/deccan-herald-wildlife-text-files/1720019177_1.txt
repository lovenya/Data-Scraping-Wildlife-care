Those trees, lovingly planted over the last four decades, had provided the lush green cover that made it such a special place and was largely responsible for the serene ambience of the beautiful township. 

Nature can be ruthless at times. This had been the worst cyclone to hit Auroville’s tranquil shores after 1972, creating havoc within the 405 hectares of green belt that had acted as a barrier against urban encroachment and had provided a habitat for wildlife. Reading the news item brought back memories of my first visit to Auroville and the way I had seen it grow over the years.

Auroville, which means ‘The City of Dawn’, was the brainchild of the Mother of Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry. Mirra Alfassa, now known as The Mother, was born in Paris on February 21, 1878. An accomplished painter and musician, she also had an intensely spiritual bent of mind. She recognised Sri Aurobindo as her spiritual mentor when she visited Pondicherry for the first time in 1912. 

Renouncing her current life, she returned permanently to Pondicherry in 1920 to take up a life of sadhana along with Sri Aurobindo and his other disciples. Sometime in the early 1930s, she had the concept of a universal township where people from all countries, rising above caste and creed, could live in peace and harmony. 

“Earth needs a place where men can live away from national rivalries, social conventions, self-contradictory moralities and contending religions; a place where human beings, freed from all slavery to the past, can devote themselves wholly to the discovery and practice of the divine consciousness that is seeking to manifest. 

Auroville wants to be this place and offers itself to all who aspire to live the truth of tomorrow,” were her words. The idea was carried forward in the mid-1960s by some of the ashramites, who had placed the proposal before the Government of India. It was then placed before the UNESCO and it was passed in 1966 “as a project of importance to the future of humanity”. The main purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity in diversity.

Sri Aurobindo worked all his life for the manifestation of a mode of consciousness beyond mind, which he called “supermind” or “the supramental.” It was Mother who created the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926 and the Sri Aurobindo Centre of Education in 1952. Auroville, which sought to further implement Sri Aurobindo’s vision, was another one of her creations. 

But Auroville is a separate entity and not a part of the ashram, although both share a common aspiration. Many have the impression that Auroville is also located in Pondicherry. But actually, it is in Tamil Nadu, 150 km south of Chennai and 10 km north of Pondicherry.

The inauguration of Auroville was held on February 28, 1968 when nearly 5,000 people comprising representatives from 124 nations, including India, assembled near the banyan tree which was to be the centre of the future township. They brought with them a little soil from their homelands, which was mixed in a white lotus-shaped urn and placed in what is now the Amphitheatre. That was when Mother gave Auroville its four-point charter, which stated:

1. Auroville belongs to nobody in particular. Auroville belongs to humanity as a whole. But to live in Auroville one must be a willing servitor of the divine consciousness.
2. Auroville will be a place of an unending education, of constant progress and a youth that never ages.
3. Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking advantage of all discoveries from without and within, Auroville will boldly spring towards future realisations.
4. Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual research for a living embodiment of an actual human unity.

Auroville calling

With a current population of around 2,000, the residents of Auroville come from all social classes, backgrounds and cultures. At the centre of Auroville lies the Peace Area, comprising the Matrimandir, considered the very soul of Auroville. It is in the shape of a huge globe made up of golden discs. It has a white, marble-clad inner chamber meant for meditation. The area also includes the amphitheatre and a lake.

Then, there is the Industrial Zone, which has many “green” industries that aim at making the township self-supporting; training centres and centres for art and craft. The Residential Zone is bordered by parks on the north, south and west, giving it ample space for individual as well as collective living.

 The Cultural Zone is meant for education and activities related to art and sports, among other things. And finally, there is the 1.25 km wide Green Belt, which houses organic farms, dairies, orchards and forests (destroyed by Hurricane Thane to a large extent) that serve as a habitat for wildlife. Incidentally, this green belt had once been a barren wasteland and was successfully transformed into a vibrant eco-system.

When I visited Auroville some years ago, I was greatly impressed by their alternate energy systems, including solar, wind and bio-gas generating devices. I was particularly interested in the huge solar collector with a diameter of 15 m that was installed on the roof of the solar kitchen, designed to generate enough steam to cook over 1,000 meals a day, and the Matrimandir Solar Power Plant comprising 484 photovoltaic modules. I was told that more than 759 homes and offices operated almost entirely on solar power.

Although the sight of the havoc created by the hurricane was upsetting, it was good to see the radiant Matrimandir standing in all its glory, untouched by nature’s fury. Perhaps even the most beautiful location needs to be rebuilt sometimes, the end promising a better future.
