Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy will meet his Karnataka counterpart Jagadish Shettar in Bangalore on Thursday to discuss the proposal for a new railway line through the Bandipur Tiger Reserve.

ADVERTISEMENTThe re-opening of vehicular traffic along National Highways 212 and 67, passing through the reserve is also on the discussion agenda of the two chief ministers. Chandy will meet Shettar at his official residence “Krishna” at 4 pm.

The proposed railway line will connect Nanjangud in Mysore district with Nilambur in Kerala. 

The railway line would pass through the tiger reserve, covering a distance of 22 km. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 3,384 crore.

The Kerala government has been pursuing Karnataka to relax the existing ban on vehicular movement at the tiger reserve from 9 pm to 6 am. Citing wildlife conservation measures, the then chief minister B S Yeddyurappa had rejected a similar request made by Kerala earlier. 

Kerala had put forth another request in December 2011 before the then chief minister D V Sadananda Gowda.
