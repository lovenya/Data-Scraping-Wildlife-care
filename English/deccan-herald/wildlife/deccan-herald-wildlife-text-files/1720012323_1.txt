The petitioners, B V Anup and Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi (WPSS), had moved the High Court seeking to stop the road widening project given the eco-sensitivity of the region.

The petitioners submitted that the National Wildlife Action Plan 2002-2016 had suggested that roads be avoided through national parks and night traffic be restricted.

Citing the SC order of November 11, 2008, the petitioners said that the State Highway 17-D, connecting Mysore and Mananthavadi, had been closed between 6 pm to 6 am. Night traffic ban, the petitioners said, was not a problem to people as the alternative roads do exist. Citing the frequent deaths of animals, the petitionersÂ  sought to introduce speed calming measures by putting up road humps and others obstacles.

The division bench headed by Justice V Gopala Gowda has ordered notice to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), State Government, Chamrajnagar DC, Principal Secretary, Forest and wildlife and others.
