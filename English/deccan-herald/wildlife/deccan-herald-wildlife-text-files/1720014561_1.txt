But that’s not what tourists are drawn to. Everyone visits the destination hoping to get a glimpse of this beautiful beast called the tiger. Even the official guide who comes along with you in the modified, green gypsy has no patience for the chital, sambar, and wild boar. Until you have seen the tiger, you have seen nothing.

 The driver won’t stop for the gamboling langurs or the dancing peacock in the forest but will bring the jeep to a sudden halt for any pugmark on the jungle trails or to show you tiger scratch marks on the tree trunks or a week-old dried tiger stool along the way. 
Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh is one tiger reserve where you have to be really unlucky not to see a tiger. It was declared a National Park in 1968 and is spread across 448 square kilometers with a core area of 105 square kilometers. 

Rich wildlife

The sightings here are the best because Bandhavgarh has the highest density of tigers among all parks in India. This has made some of the Bandhavgarh tigers celebrities and they go by a name and their feline personality and mannerisms are well-documented. “This is B2’s territory. He is the largest male tiger we have had in Bandhavgarh,” says our guide stooping over a male tiger’s pug marks.

As we drive past the thick jungle, I notice our guide hardly cranes his neck to look around. Instead he cocks his ears and listens in. This because, the Sal forest is so thick with post-monsoon undergrowth, the tiger could be sitting behind a bush just two metres away and you would not see him. 

But, it is said that the jungle talks as the tiger walks. The langurs relay an alarm from the tree tops and the chital, which likes to keep close to the monkeys for this reason, scampers away. The chital themselves have an alarm call but they are easily frightened and will raise an alarm on seeing any unfamiliar animal. 

It is the bark of the sambar deer that the guides really rely on because a sambar barks only when it actually spots a tiger. The chitals predictably give few false alarms and several tourist gypsies pile up and wait with baited breath expecting a tiger to emerge dramatically from behind the bushes. But the sambars don’t bark. They wallow neck-deep in the meadow swamps, chewing lazily on floating weeds. 

Back at the lodge, you don’t have to ask anyone whether they had the sighting that day. Those that did will be beaming and enthusiastic, showing off the pictures they took on their DSLR’s and talking about the ‘out of the world experience’ they had. Those that don’t, have long, resigned faces. I joined the latter group and hoped for better luck next time.

Bandhavgarh National Park may offer more tiger sightings, as it is located deep, in the heart of Madhya Pradesh. If you are heading here from New Delhi, be ready for a 16 hour-long train journey followed by three hours on road. From Bangalore, it is  almost 25 hours by train. The less adventurous tourists therefore, favour the easily accessible Ranthambore Tiger Reserve.

However, while Bandhavgarh may be less accessible, it more than makes up with its vibrant local culture. As we walk from our cottage to the dining room of the accommodation we are put up in, a wild boar scurries across the path. In the evening, we savour the local culture by watching a show by the Gond tribe of Madhya Pradesh.

More than just tigers

Bandhavgarh has more to it than what tiger-obsessed tourists like me care to see. Bandhavgarh fort is one such place. It sits high on a plateau overlooking the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. Until a year ago, the jeeps took you right till the top but now they drop you off near the giant supine Vishnu statue from where you have to make your way up. 

This is the spot where I have watched a tigress and her cubs have a drink on a documentary showcased on the Discovery Channel a few weeks ago. The climb is rather steep and littered with stone statues of Vishnu in his various incarnations. Bandhavgarh was once a hunting preserve of the Maharaja of Rewa. During those days, it was also home to the rare white tiger, which is only found in zoos now. I hope that won’t be the fate of the royal Bengal tigers.ADVERTISEMENT
