Most frequently visited by celebrities and commoners alike for a glimpse of the goddess, Kollur is an important link in the pilgrim circuit along the western coast. For those with a love for adventure, Kollur is an ideal base from where one can trek up the mountain. However, close to Kollur are a couple of amazing waterfalls which are often given the skip by tourists except for trekkers willing to rough it out.Â  

Hidden deep inside the dense jungles of Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary is a stupendous waterfall. Called Arishina Gundi Falls, this mesmerising waterfall takes its origin in the Kodachadri Hills. 

Flowing underground for a while, it flows through thick sholas and leaps down from about 300 ft before flowing west further down to Kollur on its way to the sea. According to mythology, Suparna (eagle) once undertook a penance on the banks of this river to mitigate the sorrows of his mother Vinutha. 
.
When the god appeared and granted his boons, he also asked for the river to be named after him. The river, accordingly, was called Sauparnika. The cascade surrounded by rocks is a beauty to behold. It is particularly enlivening in the late afternoons when the evening sun casts an orange tinge and there are rainbow colours around the place. 

It is for this colour that the falls is called Arishina Gundi which translates into a pit of turmeric in Kannada. The waters of Arishina Gundi which flow through dense forests are said to have medicinal properties.

Reaching the waterfalls is not easy, though. As they say, beauty is revealed to those who dare. The falls is a good five kms inside the sanctuary and the path with frequent steep gradients is a bit strenuous. The only way to reach it is by foot. That is not all. Being in the middle of a wildlife sanctuary makes it obligatory on the part of visitors to obtain proper permission from the forest department. Though some of the trekkers descending from the peak take a deviation to the falls it is not advised as there have been some cases of disciplinary action being taken for unauthorised entry. The officials at Kollur can permit a visit and the falls can be visited with the help of a guide. 
The checkpost and gate are just one kilometre from Kollur on Shimoga road from where the road leads to the falls. 

Another smaller but attractive waterfall in the vicinity is the Hidlumane falls, another 20 kms towards Shimoga. The starting point is Nittur, where many trekking guides offer to show the place. 

The walking distance from Nittur to the falls is about eight kms. One can take a jeep also if necessary. Though the mud road is wide, it frequently forks necessitating the help of a guide. The waterfall itself drops in seven stages. The best part of the waterfalls is about midway where the water drops in thin strings blending with the stems of the jungle around. The place is cool with a lot of shade and serves as a wonderful picnic spot.
These lovely waterfalls very well deserve to be included in the sights around Kollur.

Kollur is around 405 kms from Bangalore and can be reached via Shimoga and Hosanagara. To visit Hidlumane Falls, get down at Nittur. To get to Arishina Gundi, hire an auto from Kollur and ensure you obtain the official permission.ADVERTISEMENT
