As the state's economy is not in good shape, elephant corridor and forest expansion is not possible for the next two years. However, the efforts will continue once the situation improves, said Forest Minister Arvind Limbavali.ADVERTISEMENTChairing a meeting organised by the Forest department in Sakleshpur on Tuesday, he said, "The forest cover has increased from 18% to 23% due to the efforts of the Forest department officials. The elected representatives and the public have explained about their local issues. Sincere efforts will be made to resolve the issues.""There are continuous efforts to resolve the wild jumbo menace. We will request the Union government for more funds and rail fence at lesser price. Due to mining and other projects, the elephants and other wild animals are forced to move from their places. The department will make scientific efforts to prevent the human-animal conflict. A meeting with the MLAs concerned has been convened on February 25. A proposal would be submitted to the Union government after getting their opinions," the Minister said.The Forest department would be strengthened with the appointment of additional employees. The rail fencing works should be completed on priority and the elephants will be translocated. There are also plans to capture the rogue elephants and shifted to camps. Several mutts have requested seeking permission to rear elephants, he said.Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Vijay Kumar Gogi, Chief Conservator of Forest (Hassan) P Shankar, Deputy Conservator of Forest Basavaraj, Deputy Commisioner R Girish, SP R Srinivas Gowda were present.
