The drop in the number of arrival of birds in Chilika Lake in Orissa has caused concern for bird lovers.

The recent bird census has revealed that Asia’s biggest brackish water lagoon, which is also known as one of the topmost winter homes for migratory birds from different parts of the country and abroad, played host to much less number of avian guests this winter compared to the last year. The figures turned out to be a major disappointment for bird lovers and ornithologists. Some experts are also worried over the low gathering of the winged visitors as they feel that this could be an indication of slow degradation of the 
internationally acclaimed water body.  

“The congregation of migratory birds in the picturesque lake this year has fallen by more than a lakh, which definitely is a big number”, said Biswajit Mohanty, activist and the Secretary of Wildlife Society of Orissa, a non-governmental organisation. Mohanty is one of the experts who had taken part in this year’s bird census jointly conducted by the Chilika Development Authority (CDA), a government of Orissa undertaking, and local wildlife division of the state forest department with the help of non-governmental agencies like Bombay Natural History Society. Students from two Orissa universities had also taken part in the two-day long exercise. 

According to the census, this year 8,04,452 migratory birds had arrived in the Orissa lake for their winter sojourn which is 13 per cent less than the last year’s (2010) figure of 9,24,578. In fact, this year’s number is the lowest since 2007. 

The gathering of birds in Nalabana bird sanctuary located inside the lake had also fallen drastically this winter compared to the last year. As per the census, of the total number of 8,04,452 birds visited Chilika this year, 3,82,290 had chosen to stay inside the bird sanctuary which is 25 per cent less compared to the last year’s figure of 5,08,051. Some experts attribute the development to environmental changes under the impact of global warming in the countries of the origin of the migratory birds as well as in the Chilika Lake. 
This year the water level in Chilika remained unexpectedly high for a very long period because of the extended monsoon in Orissa. The coastal areas of the eastern state had received heavy rain under the impact of a couple low pressure areas in the Bay of Bengal even in the month of December.  

As the water level remained very high there was shortage of food for birds in the lake, particularly inside Nalabana bird sanctuary. This could have prompted the migratory birds not to stay in the Orissa lake and fly to some other bird sanctuaries within the country or may be in neighbouring countries, a section of the experts believe. 

Similarly, birds from many foreign countries fly to Chilika every year just to avoid the intense winter cold in their respective homelands. However, as the winter has become warmer in many of these “cold” countries because of global warming, the migratory birds could have preferred to stay back in their original homes instead of flying thousands of miles to spend their winter in the Orissa lake. 

Chilika plays host mainly to birds from other countries. In fact, according to the census report, of the 169 species of migratory birds identified in the lake this year, as many as 103  were from other countries. Similarly, of the total number of 8,04,452 migratory birds, a whopping 7, 91,738 were from outside India. 

Regular poaching, according to a section of the experts and bird lovers, could have also played a role in the significant fall in the gathering of migratory birds in the picturesque Orissa lagoon this winter. 

Like the previous years, several cases of poaching had been registered in the Chilika Lake this year. While more than 20 people were arrested in connection with these cases, hundreds of dead birds, including a few belonging to endangered species, had been seized from them. 

The State government has perhaps realised the problem as, if sources in the forest department are to be believed, it is now contemplating to amend the prevailing anti-poaching law to make it more stringent. “The state chief conservator of forests has already written a letter to the state government in this regard. We hope the poaching activities to come down in Chilika considerably once the anti-poaching law is tightened further”, said a senior official in the wildlife wing of the forest department. 

 If some of the experts are to be believed, not only Chilika, a few other smaller winter homes for migratory birds in Orissa have also recorded less number of avian guests this winter compared to the last year. This has further upset the bird lovers in the state. 
“This could be a temporary phenomenon. But the state government should 
appoint an expert committee and conduct a study to ascertain the exact cause behind the fall in the congregation of migratory birds, particularly in the Chilika Lake. Steps should be taken to arrest the problem if there is any within the control of the government”, said P K Senapati, a Bhubaneswar-based businessman who visits the beautiful lagoon at least once every winter to see the migratory birds.ADVERTISEMENT
