Surveillance has been intensified in poultry firms of Ganjam district following outbreak of bird flu in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

ADVERTISEMENT"We have stepped up surveillance measures in the district. We have also asked officials in border areas, including Chikiti, Rangeilunda and Patrapur blocks, to keep an eye on poultry products coming from Andhra and Telangana," Chief District Veterinary Officer (CDVO) Trinath Nayak said.

Farm owners are being advised to vaccinate poultry to prevent spread of infection, he said.
There are around 150 poultry farms, including 22 layer farms, in Ganjam district. The layer farms are most vulnerable to H5N1 virus (bird flu), the CDVO said, adding that there was no instance of avian influenza in the district.

Divisional forest officer (Chilika) B R Das said forest officials have also mounted surveillance in the sprawling lake area even though 90 per cent of migratory birds have returned. Species like pelican and flamingo, however, are there in the lake.

"In January, we had sent some samples of birds to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases laboratory in Bhopal. But not a single sample tested positive. Despite this, wildlife officials are keeping a watch on behaviour of birds in the lake," the DFO said.
