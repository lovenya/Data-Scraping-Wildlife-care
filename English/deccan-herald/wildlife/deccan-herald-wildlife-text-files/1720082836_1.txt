The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Forest Conservation (Amendment) bill with barely any debate even though the proposed law worried many for its controversial clauses like doing away with forest clearance for defence projects within 100 km from the border.ADVERTISEMENTAmidst uproarious scenes, the bill was cleared by the Lower House with Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav claiming that it would help fulfil India’s international climate change commitment of creating an additional 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon sink.Yadav said the bill would promote agro-forestry and plantation while making life easy for people living in forested areas.Also Read | Opposition members walk out of Rajya Sabha over govt's stand on discussion of Manipur issue“In Jharkhand, there are schools including girls schools, which can not even build a toilet with clearance under the Forest Conservation Act,” he said, asserting that the bill didn’t contradict the Forest Rights Act.The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha days after a Joint Committee of the lawmakers gave its green signal relying on the Union Environment Ministry’s assurance that adequate safeguards had been kept in the bill to prevent its misuse.Four Opposition MPs, however, didn’t agree with the Joint Committee report and put up their dissent notes opposing the bills. They also opposed the title of the bill, which is in Hindi.Yadav said the title - Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980 - was kept in Hindi in accordance with the Prime Minister’s vision since it's a bill that deals with issues faced by common people and hence the title was in their language.The ministry in a statement claimed the amendments would refurbish the spirit of the act for conservation and augmentation of forests, while enhancing the productivity and raising of plantations outside forests.On the exemptions given to projects within 100 km from the border – this covers the entire north east geographically – the ministry informed the House panel that such exemptions were not generic in nature and would be accorded to “specific linear projects of strategic importance”.Moreover, the relaxations will not be available to private entities and use of the exemptions will be need based. The exemptions will be subject to terms and conditions like compensatory afforestation and mitigation plans.Similar exemptions were given to projects requiring 0.10 hectares of forest land on the side of roads and railways to provide connectivity to habitation, up to 10 hectares of land proposed for security related infrastructure and up to 5 hectares of forest land in Left Wing Extremism affected districts for public utility projects.The bill also provides for setting up of zoos and safaris outside the protected areas provided they are owned by the government and in accordance with the plan approved by the Central Zoo Authority.Similarly, ecotourism projects can be taken up in the forest areas if such projects are approved in the working plan or wildlife management plan or tiger conservation plans. The bill added infrastructure for frontline forest staff, ecotourism, zoo and safari into the array of forestry activities for the cause of conservation of forests.Surveys and investigation in the forest areas will not be considered as a non-forestry activity because such activities are temporary in nature and involve no perceptible change in the land use, according to the ministry, which asserts that the proposed law will strengthen the regulatory mechanism besides catering to the livelihood aspirations of the local communities.
