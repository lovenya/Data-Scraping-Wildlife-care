Deshprabhu was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit of Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) near here late last night, few hours after he was arrested by Crime Branch.

GMCH Medical Superintendent Dr Rajan Cuncolienkar said that Deshprabhu was suffering from hypertension and chest pain. "He has been kept under observation," he said.

The NCP leader was arrested last evening after his anticipatory bail was rejected by Additional Principal District and Sessions judge here.

He is the prime accused in the multi-crore mining scam which is being probed by the Crime Branch. He is accused of illegally extracting ore from his property in Pernem taluka.

Crime Branch has already arrested Gitesh Naik, a contractor, who transported the ore from the site. State Mines and Geology department confirming the illegal ore extraction had fined Deshprabhu for Rs 1.7 crore.

The Crime branch has also interrogated State Mines and Geology director Arvind Lolienkar, Chief Wildlife warden Shashi Kumar and Transport director Arun Desai in connection with this case.ADVERTISEMENT
