Addressing after inaugurating wildlife photography exhibition and ‘Save Tiger’ campaign organised by the Kundapur unit of Karnataka Nature Photographers’ Association here on Sunday, Sherigar said that it is an adventurous job to capture wildlife pictures through lens and to unfurl natural mysteries through studies. “One has to be very dedicated and  patient to become a wildlife photographer,” he added. 

“Indian tigers, which are the unique species, need to be protected. It is a shocking fact that the total number of tigers in Khan, Bhandavgad, Rana Thamboor, Thodaba and Bandipur forests is only 1,411. If the situation continue like this, next generation will never be able to see tigers,” he said. 

Government implements several schemes spending crores for development of mankind. Efforts should also be made to preserve wildlife, he added. 

Flora and Fauna Organisation founder president and amateur photographer Dr Subodh Kumar Malli was felicitated on the occasion. Photographers Association Honourary President Byloor Udaykumara Shetty, President Shashidar Hiremat and others were present.ADVERTISEMENT
