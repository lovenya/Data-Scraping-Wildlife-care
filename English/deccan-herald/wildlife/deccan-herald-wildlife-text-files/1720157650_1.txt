Gendekatte Wildlife Sanctuary was in news recently following the death of a deer, whose carcass was not removed for three days.

ADVERTISEMENTThe plans of the Department of Forests, an year ago, to provide a picnic spot near the city has miserably failed. Though Hassan is a prominent tourist city, there is no place for the local residents to spend a weekend.

The Forest department attempted to upgrade Gendekatte Sanctuary on the outskirts of the city and the place got spruced up April last. A playhouse was constructed for children and a Rock Garden was developed near the entrance along with a duck pond with a few rare birds and a deer park.

Exactly one year later, the condition of the wildlife sanctuary is pathetic, with no visitors, thanks to the negligence of the authorities concerned.

The saplings, that were planted last year, have not been attended to. The garden has a lush growth of weeds. 

The situation is similar at the rock garden too. There is no water in the duck pond. It is covered with algae and emanates stench.

Officials in the Forest department said, cooperation of the district administration and elected representatives was necessary to make it a success. Basic amenities like drinking water and toilets are a must at picnic spots. Bus services should be introduced every day, or at least during weekends to facilitate tourists. 

Development of roads, streetlights is a must. All this cannot be done only by the Forest department. The departments concerned should take interest in developing the spot, keeping in mind the tourists inflow, opine locals.
