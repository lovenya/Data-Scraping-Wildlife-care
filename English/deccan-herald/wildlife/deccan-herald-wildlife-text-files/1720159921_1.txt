The State Forest Department will conduct a public hearing on Wednesday. 

The time may have come now to fulfil the long-pending demand of the environmentalists to declare the Chincholi forest a wildlife sanctuary as the State Wildlife Advisory Board Vice-President Anil Kumble would be present at the hearing.   

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests B K Singh, who is already in Chincholi, said Kumble would attend the adalat at Konchavaram village in the forest on Wednesday afternoon. 

Spread across Gulbarga and Yadgir districts, and also the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Chincholi is the largest dryland forest spanning an area of 1,569 sq km. Comprising four ranges, it has around 196 sq km of forest, which is one-fifth of the total forest area in the district.

The forest has a good dry deciduous and moist deciduous forest in the core with acacia and teak plantations on the fringes. Apart from the large Chandrampalli dam, four small dams too exist at its centre. The forest hosts a rich biodiversity. 

With the human density of 121 per sq km and a village for every 12 km sq, the region has 30 lambani thandas relying on forests for a living.

Apart from the rich medicinal herbs and trees, species like red Sanders and sandalwood have been found abundantly. 

“We have over 104 species of flora like Anogessus Latifolia, Chloroxylon, Bosweellia Serrat and Madhuca Indica,” said Radha Devi, Conservator of Forests, Gulbarga circle.

The forest is home to fauna like black buck, common fox, four-horned antelope,  fruit bat, hyena, Indian wolf, panther and wild boar. Over 35 species of birds here include black drongo, black-winged kite, blossom-headed parakeet, blue pigeon, black-headed oriole and grey patridge.ADVERTISEMENT
