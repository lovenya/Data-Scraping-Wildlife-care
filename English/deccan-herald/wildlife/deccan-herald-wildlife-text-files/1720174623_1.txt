A Czech husband and wife duo have been arrested for alleged theft of insect genes, police said today.They were arrested at the southern town of Elpitiya's Kurundugahahatepma on Friday along with their local aide.

The Elpitiya magistrate granted bail while ordering them to re-appear in court on June 25, police said.

They had in their possession insects filled in polythene bags and insect gene collecting apparatus.

Sri Lankan wildlife officials say that an international racket of collecting genes of insects indigenous to Sri Lanka is being carried out by racketeers who arrive in the island on tourist visas.

In late April, a Dutch professor was arrested and fined USD 12,000 for keeping many small insects in polythene bags.

The forest department officials are paying much attention particularly around the Sinharaja forest reserve on the possibility of gene robberies in the guise of eco tourism.ADVERTISEMENT
