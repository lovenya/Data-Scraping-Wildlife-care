The government will give a special allowance along with the salary to those officers of the Wildlife division who work in forests. The special allowance is Rs 3,500 for forest officers in the wildlife division, Rs 2,700 for forest conservators and Rs 2,000 for ‘D’ group employees. The allowance will come into effect retrospectively from May this year. 

ADVERTISEMENTAnnouncing this at apress conference in Bengaluru on Monday, Forest Minister Ramanath Rai said many “forest motivators” have been working for the last two to three decades. “They have been a great help to the department. The honorarium for them would be increased to Rs 7,000 from Rs 5,500.” 

The minister said the compensation for those who lose crops in attack by wild animals has been doubled. In addition, those who suffer permanent disability due to attacks by animals will get Rs five lakh as compensation. Earlier, it was Rs 50,000, he said.

Rai said those who have constructed houses in forest buffer zone (100 metre) are concerned that they may lose their property. Though the land belongs to the Revenue department, it comes under the forest buffer zone. Those who are living in such places would get a ‘consent letter’ from the Forest department, he added.
