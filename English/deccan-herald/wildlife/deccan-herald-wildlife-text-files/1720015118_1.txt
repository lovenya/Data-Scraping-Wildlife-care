Wildlife warden D Gogoi said a group of six poachers entered the park and fired at an adult rhino near the Mihimukh range, but they failed to hit the target. 

The encounter continued for about 30 minutes in which four poachers were killed, while two more managed to escape taking cover of the thick undergrowths. A rifle along with a large quantity of ammunition, jungle boots, food stuff, and raincoats, were recovered from the dead poachers.

On Tuesday, seven poachers were arrested while they were coming in a car to sell a rhino horn to an international animal organ smuggling syndicate close to the park.  A rhino horn and cash amounting to Rs 345,000 were seized from the gang on Tuesday.
