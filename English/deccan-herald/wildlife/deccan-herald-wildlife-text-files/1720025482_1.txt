A tusker aged between 12 and 15 years was electrocuted at Kelagane village near Baskal at 2 am on Thursday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe incident occurred when the elephant came in contact with a live electric wire as an electric pole had fallen in the land belonging to Nagarajagowda, resulting in the instant death of the tusker. 

Veterinary doctor Dr Hemanth who visited the spot and performed post mortem confirmed the death of the elephant due to electrocution. The Wildlife and Forest Department officers buried the carcass of the animal after taking a pair of tusks into possession. The local women who had arrived at the spot, performed ritual to the dead tusker by offering flowers, coconut and fruits.

The tusker which was normally found in this part of the region since last five months, had perhaps built a bonding with the villagers. The fact that tears rolled down from the eyes of some of the senior citizens watching the dead animal, only reflected it. Kelagane Satish who first informed about the death of the tusker to the Forest and Mescom staff, said that the villagers were saddened due to the elephant’s death as the elephant was mild and never harmed anybody. 

“It never destroyed our crop and it was good to us,” he said.
The Forest Department staff said that the dead tusker was one among the two tuskers which had arrived at Kote Kere via Chikmagalur. The tusker was mostly moving in Kundur, Saragodu forest regions.
