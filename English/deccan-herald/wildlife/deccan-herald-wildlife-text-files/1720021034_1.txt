Last week the minister had announced that as many as 25 elephants in the Alur Range would be shifted to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. 

However, the forest department is yet to get consent from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to translocate the elephants. 

The department has decided to begin the process in two months time.Â  The minister, who headed a departmental meeting on Monday, has directed the officials to set up a temporary camp at the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, to facilitate movement of elephants, before they are released into the wild. 

When contacted, Yogeeshwara said his department was indeed taking a huge risk, as the translocation experiment had failed previously. 

The department has proposed a budget of Rs 1.3 crore to execute the translocation of elephants. Principal Secretary Kaushik Mukherjee, PCCF I B Srivastava, PCCF (Wildlife) B K Singh, and others attended the meeting.ADVERTISEMENT
