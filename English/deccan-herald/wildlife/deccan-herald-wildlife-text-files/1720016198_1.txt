The lions, who seemed to be enjoying the rain, did not hurt or attack passersby on the road.

“After coming out from the forest, these lions were on their way to a nearby Shetrunji river to quench their thirst,” range forest officer of the area Chandrakant Dandhiya said on Sunday.

Wildlife photographer Dilip Jiruka, who encashed the opportunity by clicking several photographs of lions, said: “These lions were on their way to the river and they had been enjoying the rain that lashed the area on Saturday.” They were roaming freely on the road and passersby did not panic with their presence, he said.ADVERTISEMENT
