A PIL was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday by animal rights activist Gauri Maulekhi challenging three separate notifications declaring nilgai, wild boar and monkey as vermin and allowing their culling.

ADVERTISEMENTA vacation bench of Justices Adrash Kumar Goel and L Nageswar Rao agreed to consider the petition within a week on a plea for urgent hearing made by senior advocate Anand Grover.

The petitioner sought direction to quash the government orders declaring the three animals as vermin and their culling in the states of Bihar, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

 The move has recently seen two Cabinet ministers lock horns over the decision taken by the Ministry of Environment and forest, after reports emerged showing hunters killing nilgais in Bihar.

The petitioner contended that Section 62 of the Wildlife Protection Act, which allowed the Centre to issue notification, declaring an animal as vermin, was excessive, arbitrary and unfettered.

Citing the reports showing people were hired to kill animals declared vermin, Grover said the Centre did not have the power to issue such notifications. 

“The impugned notifications have been passed in absolute disregard of the human-wildlife conflict plaguing the country and without any scientific survey backing them,” the petition contended. 

It is the “poor innocent animals” that fell victims to environmental apathy and indifference on the part of the government, it contended.

In the absence of any relevant study, the notifications were in violation of the Constitution and the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
