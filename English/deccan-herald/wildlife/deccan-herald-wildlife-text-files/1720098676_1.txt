The cases of wildlife crime and poaching appears to have increased in the region of late. The Forest department officials have cracked six such cases by arresting several poachers over the past one month.ADVERTISEMENTThe officials suspect that international smugglers are active in the district as the demand for wild animals are high in foreign countries, particularly in China.As many as 12 persons have been arrested in connection with more than six wildlife crimes reported in just one month in Mysuru. Tiger pelt, owl, ivory and Indian pengolian have been seized from the arrested.Indian pangolins are in great demand in China and the smugglers transport them through two routes from Mysuru. One route is via Uttar Pradesh, Nepal, Tibet and then to China and another route is through Kolkata and Mizoram and then to China.Besides, the demand for monitor lizards and owls are high locally. While lizards are used for meat and for medicinal purpose, there is a belief that owl brings luck, if one sees it in the morning. The illegal trade of owl was
rampant during the election.It has to be recalled that recently the forest mobile squad had arrested a man near Yelwal in Mysuru taluk on the charge of possessing tiger pelt.Four persons were held in two separate cases of smuggling Indian pangolins on
October 28 and November 3 respectively. Similarly, the City Crime Branch (CCB) police had arrested a man for smuggling deer skin and horns.An official claimed that while the local poachers are nabbed the main players in the illegal trade were yet to be identified.According to wildlife activists, while poachers have been active in the region fromdecades, the cases were coming to light only in recent days owing to strict vigil by the Forest department.As Mysuru is near to Bandipur and Nagarahole Forest regions, smugglers transport the animals via Mysuru, said an activist.
