"I was abused and beaten for raising the issue of payments made to contractors for civil works not done and non-payment of wages to forest guards," Nandish said in the complaint.
Similarly, in the Haveri division, allegations of irregularities surfaced in the root stock scheme, which seeks to incentivise social forestry works. The complaint had alleged a vast difference between works undertaken and the funds released.
