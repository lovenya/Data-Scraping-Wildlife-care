At the phone-in programme organised by Deputy Commissioner C Shikha here on Thursday, citizens complained of several instances of land encroachment in the district. 

ADVERTISEMENTApart from land encroachment cases, complaints against fair price shops and liquor stores charging more than the maximum retail price was also aired during the programme.

A resident of Siddramaiahna Hundi, Mahadeva complained that a fair price shop in the village was distributing only four litres of kerosene as against five litres for BPL families, as announced by the government. Edathore, a neighbouring village, belonging to Varuna Hobli was also witnessing similar problems, he said. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah represents Varuna Hobli.

Rajashekar, a resident of Nerale grama panchayat, Nanjangud taluk complained that a tank with an area of 722 acres has been encroached. 

Shikha said that a survey of the concerned tank will be taken up by revenue officials and encroachments will be cleared soon. Harish, a resident of Hunsur in his call complained about land encroachment in Hunsur wildlife division.

Kick-less

Complaints from Ravishankar and Shivanna from Hulahalli grama panchayat, filled the meeting hall at DC office with laughter as they demanded a retail outlet of Mysore Sales International Limited in their village. The liquor shops in our village charge more than 20 percent of maximum retail price. District administration should take steps to prevent such shops from fleecing people, they said.

Another caller, Swamy Naik alleged that the Housing Board Land allotted to him was sold illegally and threatened to commit suicide if the land was not returned to him. Shikha directed tahsildhar to look into the issue.
