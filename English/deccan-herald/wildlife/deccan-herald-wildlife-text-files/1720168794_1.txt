Police in Uttar Pradesh’s Baharaich district rescued an eight-year-old ‘wild’ girl from the nearby jungles who attracted public attention by her monkey-like behaviour. 

When approached by a human being, the girl grunts and screeches like a monkey. Many visit the district hospital, where she is currently treated, to see her. 

Receiving information from the locals, the police rescued the unnamed girl from Katarniya Ghat, a famous wildlife sanctuary, and handed her over to  the child welfare organisation Child Line. 

“We found that the girl needed medical treatment and therefore admitted her to the district hospital,” Jitendra Singh, district director of the organisation, said. 

A hospital employee said the girl can neither speak nor understand languages and she makes strange sounds like a monkey. “She does not eat with her fingers but directly with her mouth,” he added. 

Police said a group of monkeys surrounded the girl when they tried to rescue her from the jungle. “They resisted and even attacked the cops when they tried to haul the girl away. Even the girl screeched wildly,” said a police official. 

Though the rescue happened in January, her pictures went viral on social networking sites on Wednesday and brought several visitors to the hospital. 

Doctors are trying hard to teach human behaviour and some language to the wild child and have made some progress. “She now walks on her legs. Earlier she used to be on all her four,” a doctor said. 

Additional superintendent of police Dinesh Tripathi said efforts have been made to trace her parents.ADVERTISEMENT
