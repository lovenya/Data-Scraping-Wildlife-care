Under the provision, no person shall destroy, exploit or remove any wildlife from a national park or destroy or damage or divert the habitat of any wild animal, the petition said.

The park, a mix of thorny, scrub, dry and moist deciduous patches is also home to 215 species of birds, 150 species of butterflies and 20 species of snakes and over 250 varieties of trees.
