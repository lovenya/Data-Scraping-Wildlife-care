Ten peacocks died after consuming pesticide-laced grains at Raagimasalavada in Harapanahalli taluk, Davangere, on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENTThis is the second such incident in the State. A few days ago, eight peacocks had died after consuming poisoned grains at Shiggaon in neighbouring Haveri district.

Deputy Conservator of Forest S N Malavalli said Gudda Nayaka, a farmer from the neighbouring Udayapura Tanda, had spread pesticide-laced ragi and jowar grains around his field to protect his produce. A case has been registered against Nayaka and four others, including his children, under the Wildlife Protection Act.
