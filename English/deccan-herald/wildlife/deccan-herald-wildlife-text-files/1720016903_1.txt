Two days after his swearing-in ceremony, Vijayashankar had spoken of conservation and had assured that the night safari would not come up at Bannerghatta. However on Tuesday, speaking to the media on the sidelines of an event marking the 56th Wildlife Week hosted by the Forest Department, Vijayashankar said that he and his department officers will “fully co-operate” with the Tourism Department on the issue of Bannerghatta night safari. 

According to Vijayashankar, Tourism Department Minister Janardhana Reddy has already spoken to him on the matter and had quoted examples over night safaris being hosted in various other nations to attract and boost the tourism revenue for the State.

“We will take stock of these various night safaris being initiated and followed across the world, the kind of security they have implemented for the safety of the wildlife and also the manpower for the same,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT
