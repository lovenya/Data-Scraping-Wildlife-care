Mustaq Ali Khan (40), was arrested along with two leopards' hide near the Pohri bus stand last night in Shivpuri, Superintendent of Police (SP) Rajendra Prasad told PTI today.
Khan has told us that he got the skins from a tribal, who had killed the animals at Palpur-Kuno in neighbouring Sheopur district, the Shivpuri SP said.

"On a tip off, we laid a trap and when Khan was negotiating with our decoy customer, we nabbed him along with skins," Prasad said.

The SP said that they had informed the forest officials about the skin.
Meanwhile, the tribal who allegedly killed the leopards had been picked up by police for interrogation, sources said.

The police are trying to recover bones and other stuffs of leopards from him, they added.
The first pack of Cheetahs, two males and six females from South Africa will arrive by ship to India next year's winter and are going to be translocated to Sheopur's Palpur- Kuno, which is going to be fenced from all sides, forest officials said.ADVERTISEMENT
