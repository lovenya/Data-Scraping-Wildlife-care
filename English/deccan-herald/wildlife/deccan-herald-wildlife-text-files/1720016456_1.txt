Gehlot landed here this morning to discuss issues related to wildlife and infrastructure and facilities in the Ranthambore National Park where reporters drew his attention to noise pollution during the wedding beyond midnight, following which he directed the District Collector Ravi Kumar to conduct an inquiry.

Sources said that loud music was on in the resort till 2.30 am today which was a clear violation of rules and wild animals in the forest area would have been disturbed.

"Though no specific complaint was made in this regard by locals but as per the directive of the CM following inputs from some journalists at airstrip here, forest and district administration officials have been asked to probe the matter," Kumar told PTI.

"The officials would submit their report as soon as they find some substantial input in this regard. I had already appointed a four-member committee to check violation of rules in the eco-sensitive area and the members visited the venue yesterday.

"It was a private event and we have nothing to do with it but the resort will be penalized if they found guilty of violation of any rule," he added.

Brand and Perry exchanged wedding vows according to Hindu traditions at the luxury Aman-I-Khas resort near the Ranthambore national park in the presence of around 100 guests.ADVERTISEMENT
