In an interesting trend, the number of immersions of Ganesha idols in the public places has come down in the city when compared to the last year.ADVERTISEMENTThis year, even the immersions of plaster of Paris (PoP) idols in the public places have reduced. However, the amount of garbage has increased by 53.89 tonnes, compared to the previous year.According to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) data, this time many have opted for clay idols rather than PoP idols.As many as 2.29 lakh clay idols were immersed, as against 11,576 PoP idols in the public places this time. During 2017, there were 3.48 lakh clay idols and 16,353 PoP immersions. However, the total number of immersions have come down this year, as most of them immersed idols in their own homes, say BBMP officials.The most common places for immersion were Sankey Tank, Halasuru Lake and Yediyur Lake, where the civic body has deployed workers to clean the kalyanis after the fifth day of the festival.“Many residents, especially those who reside in apartments, have chosen not to opt for the public immersion tanks or the ones arranged by the Palike. They chose small idols so that they can immerse on their own premises,” said Dr Sandhya, nodal officer, health and solid waste management, BBMP.She also said there is an increased awareness in people about the harmful effects of PoP idols on the environment.On the other hand, the data also shows an increase in the festival garbage.In 2017, 441.3 tonnes of garbage was produced. But this year, it has increased to 495.2 tonnes.“The usage of flowers and packing material are the main waste in the festival garbage. The BBMP workers have cleared this across the city,” said Sandhya.She also said the civic body needs to mobilise its awareness campaign against the ill-effects of PoP idols.“As this involves religious sentiments, it is difficult for us to get people to use clay idols and ban the PoP ones, But we will further step up our awareness campaign in the coming days,” she said.Praneeth KS, a resident of Jayanagar, said it was a welcome trend to know that the number of PoP idols has reduced, and this trend should continue further.
