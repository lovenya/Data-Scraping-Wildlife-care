The fawn, which had come out of the nearby forest area, was found greviously injured. 

Eyewitnesses later said that the animal had been attacked by a pack of stray dogs.

Aside from bite wounds, the fawn had also suffered multiple injuries after becoming snared on a nearby fence running astride the Institute property. A horn had broken off and the animal had lost all of its teeth. The face bore several injuries.

Wildlife officials believe that the fawn strayed into the village in search of food before it was attacked by dogs. A group of youths who came across the animal had rushed to the fawnâ€™s rescue. They chased away the dogs and attempted to catch the fawn in order to render first aid. Although the animal initially resisted, it finally allowed itself to be trapped. The youths took it to a safe location and alerted the Forest department officials. 

Forest officer Mallayya, Forest conservator Anandappa and others transported the fawn to a veterinary hospital by an auto rickshaw. The animal was promptly released into the forest at around Baiyyapanahalli after treatment.
