Four companies which have challenged the ban had contended that public comments were having an adverse effect. The court held that the matter was sub judice and nothing could be disclosed till the final verdict. The petitioners were given the liberty to approach the vacation Bench of the High Court if any adverse comments were made in public. 

Rejoinder filed

The petitioners - Endosulfan Manufacturers and Formulators Welfare Association and three others - have filed a rejoinder to the affidavit filed by the State government. The petitioners have accused the government of playing into the hands of the European manufacturers who have maligned endosulfan to push their patented products. They have further stated that when used as recommended, endosulfan is not harmful to birds, fowl, bees and wildlife. 

“The World Health Organisation has declared endosulfan as moderately hazardous class-2 chemical and not highly toxic as claimed by the respondents,” they argued.

They also contended that a three-member expert committee appointed by the State government in the year 2004 categorically concluded that endosulfan was not the cause of disorders and diseases in Dakshina Kannada. They also said that no link had been established to prove that the cases of physical deformities were the direct result of the exposure to the insecticide.
