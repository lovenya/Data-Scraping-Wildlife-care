The animal had gone on the rampage killing six people including a 28-year old man Yogesh from Tiptur on Thursday morning. Following his death, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden had directed the DCF Hassan to expedite the capturing process.

A team of six Kumki elephants (Pachyderms used in trapping elephants) headed by Chittiappa, Chief Veterinarian of Bannerghatta Biological Park, who was specially deputed for the job along with around 1,000 people successfully trapped the jumbo in an eucalyptus plantation near Tiptur. The animal was darted by Chittiappa before capturing it with the help of Kumkis.ADVERTISEMENT
