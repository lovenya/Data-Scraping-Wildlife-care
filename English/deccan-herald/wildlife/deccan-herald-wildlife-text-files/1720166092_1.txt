The handsome actor and tech entrepreneur Kunal Kapoor and his lovely wife Naina are in the Maldives for a much needed break. Kunal who has had a hectic year shooting for two films back to back, representing his crowdfunding platform at a number of tech meets and attending the Aspen global leadership network programme in China, has taken time off for a romantic adventure holiday with his wife. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe couple who got marriedÂ  in the Seychelles and are known to be wildlife enthusiasts, have gone deep sea diving in the Maldives for a week.

Kunal is a trained pilot and usually gets his rush at 10,000 feet in the sky, now seems to have trained his eyes on the world under water. The couple will spend the next week training for their diving licences and exploring the vast and famous reef and coral life in that part of the world.

A source close to Kunal has confirmed this news and said Kunal has lately been busy with his professional commitments and was really looking forward to this break. The couple love adventure and the outdoors so they choose to make this deep sea diving trip to the Maldives.
