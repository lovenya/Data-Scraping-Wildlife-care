The report contains details about how the Government intends to introduce the night safari without affecting the wildlife in the park. The petitioner B R Deepak, who contends that the night safari will affect wild life in core areas, argued that Bannerghatta was the best place to be declared as an elephant corridor.

He further argued that the night safari would disturb the nocturnal activities of the animals, to which the Bench comprising Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice B SÂ  Patil questioned if any survey had been conducted to establish that the animals would indeed be disturbed.

The petitioner also argued that introducing the night safari would lead to the alteration of the boundary of the Bannerghatta Biological Park under Section 35(5) of the Wildlife Protection Act.

The Section states that no alteration of boundaries can be made by the State government except on the recommendation of the National Board. But the State government had sought the permission of the Central Zoo Authority and this was not the competent authority to seek permission, Deepak stated. The State will be submitting its arguments on Wednesday.ADVERTISEMENT
