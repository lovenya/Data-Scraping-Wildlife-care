Few trees have been chopped to facilitate the construction work, which is clear violation of Wildlife Protection Act. 

“Non forest related activities should not be allowed inside the reserve forest. The authorities must take permission from the Forest Ministry of the Central government to take up any development work inside the forest. Unfortunately, a local organisation is getting ready to construct the hall with the funds released by the state government inside the reserve forest,” they said.

Though all the arrangements have been made for the construction activities, the wildlife division officials are not initiating any action against the organisers. “With the community hall, wild animals can not move freely inside the forest. 

The community hall should be shifted to other place,” they said.  The villagers urged the Deputy Commissioner to initiate action against the culprits. The DC must convene a high level meeting to discuss the issue.
