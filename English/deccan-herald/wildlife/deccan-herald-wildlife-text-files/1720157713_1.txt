Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan will once again sport a moustache as he plays the role of an Inspector for Dish TV's upcoming commercial.

ADVERTISEMENTThe 47-year-old previously sported a moustache in films like "Paheli" and "Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi".

From the bindi not being perfectly round in a TV serial to crocodile's tooth not looking clean in a wildlife documentary, SRK is seen going behind every scene to ensure the viewer gets the perfect look in the advertisement. 

Directed by Piyush Raghani, the three TV commercials are part of Dish truHD+ campaign and will go on air Thursday.
