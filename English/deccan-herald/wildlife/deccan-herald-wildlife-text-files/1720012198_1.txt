Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh had on Thursday said there may be 70-80 tigers in the Sunderban Biosphere Reserve, which along with the 50 lakh human population, faces risk from rising sea level and hungry tides. 

Even though this figure is not an official one, this could possibly be the first indication from the government on how many tigers are still roaming inside the serpentine creeks and marshy mangrove forests.

India’s official tiger count stands at 1411, which is the average value between the lowest possible limit of 1165 and the ceiling of 1657. 

The 2008 tiger census, however, did not include Sunderbans. Also, the census did not include data from Indravati Tiger Park in Chhattisgarh and Palamu Reserve in Jharkhand. In both places, forest officials could not enter due to threats from Naxalites.

The problem in Sunderbans, however, was different. Due to the complicated landscape and multiple methods, ranging from radio-collaring to prey estimation, to determine the tiger count, wildlife scientists asked for a separate exercise only for Sunderbans. 
According to the 2008 tiger census report, it would take a minimum of three years to collect and evaluate the Sunderban data to arrive at a number.

Assuming that the prey estimation began in 2007, the Sunderban census should be over by now, though the results have not yet been disclosed. The last round of tiger census – conducted using new method – are not comparable with older pugmark-based estimates.

The last pugmark-based estimate in 2001-02 put the number of big cats in Sunderbans at 245. Officials at the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) refused to elaborate on the numbers given by the minister. “The census is still going on and will take another three to four months to complete. We can give the tiger count only after the report is submitted,” NTCA member-secretary Rajesh Gopal told Deccan Herald.
