Speaking to mediapersons, he said by including Western Ghats to the list of heritage sites would help in conserving flora and fauna of the region. The State government should immediately take steps as Bandipur forest range comes under the Western Ghats and it is everybody’s duty to protect the wildlife, he added. 

He also suggested that as Bandipur attracts a large number of wildlife enthusiasts and tourists, awareness should be created among them not to create nuisance in the surroundings and disturb the animals. 

He also opined that the place  should be announced as elephant corridor, which would help in protecting them.

The onus of protecting the wild animals and prevent man-animal conflict lies on the forest department, he said.The government should chalk out various programmes to protect natural resources in the forests, he said.
