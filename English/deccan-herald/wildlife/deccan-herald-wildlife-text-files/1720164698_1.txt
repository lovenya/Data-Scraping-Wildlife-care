Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s grand plan to boost tourism in North Bengal by setting up a helipad in the middle of Buxa Tiger Reserve has encountered a major roadblock. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe tiger reserve came under spotlight earlier this year after the revelation that its tiger population has come down to five. Conservationists feel a helipad in the area could further affect the local fauna. “The plan is also illegal,” some experts said.

Sources said right at the planning stage, senior Forest Department officials had expressed concerns in front of the chief minister over having a helipad in the core area of the tiger reserve. 

“She, however, decided to go ahead. The plan was recently placed before the state wildlife advisory board for review and was turned down. The chief minister is displeased,” an official said.

Comprising retired forest officers, wildlife experts and environmentalists, the board advises the administration on matters related to forestry and wildlife, including selecting areas as sanctuaries or national parks, and formulating policies for protection and conservation of flora and fauna. 

Their decision to turn down the helipad plan was dictated by findings of a recent study on tiger population at Buxa, which finds it to be one of the most active zones in tiger habitat.
