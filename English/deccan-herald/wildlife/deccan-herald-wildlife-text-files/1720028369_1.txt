“Instead of cutting trees why can’t we use the fallen ones? Have our demands become more important than our survival? There is a limit to everyone’s need, but not to everyone’s greed,” said 11-year-old Hiranya Chitibhargavi at ‘Earth Day Carnival’ organised by the city government at chief minister Sheila Dikshit’s house on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe carnival marked the end of Earth Week 2013. Its theme was ‘Reuse, Recycle and Reduce’.

Hiranya, suffering from cerebral palsy, was among the 5,000 students who participated in the event. “We should use things which don’t harm the environment,” she added during a storytelling session.

To make schoolchildren understand the importance of healthy environment, the carnival was held, Dikshit said. 

“It was an effort to bring awareness on conservation of the nature among children. Students from schools’ eco-clubs across the city spent half-day to express their commitment towards protection of the environment,” she said.

 “Children hold the key to a more optimistic future.”

Dikshit also released a book “The Asola Wildlife Sanctuary” by Bombay Natural History Society and a poster on “The Common Butterflies of Delhi” by WWF India.
Paro Anand, a writer said, “You can’t just talk or think about the environment. You have to feel it. Then only you will do something about it. If only I feel for earth, I will turn off the tap and switch off the light.”

The carnival comprised environmental games, interactive sessions like storytelling, animal mask-making, and Earth Day poster making,
