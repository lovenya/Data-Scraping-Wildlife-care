The officers had laid traps in two locations at Kundur gate near Lakkavalli to catch the big cats alive on Thursday, but there was no sign of the animals. Even as the Forest officers were shifting the iron cages to a new location, the leopard attacked them from behind a shrub. Shocked, the officers shot at the leopard, he said. After the post-mortem, the carcass was burnt in the forests, he added.
