MLA Dr Y C Vishwanath said that the government has okayed the proposal to lift 1.45 TMC water from Hebbe reservoir and supply it to historic Madagadakere. 

ADVERTISEMENTWith the proposal, water will be flowed to 36 tanks in the taluk. The work on the project will commence shortly. 

Speaking to presspersons, he said farmers leaders, arecanut growers and elected representatives fought together to get the project cleared. At present, Madagadakere has the capacity to store .35 TMC water. If it was increased to 1.45 TMC, then it can fill 36 small tanks in the taluk. The water from these tanks will join Vedavathi river and finally to Vanivilasa Sagara dam. Madagadakere irrigates 7,000 hectare land in its catchment area.

When Hebbe project is completed,  it can irrigate 21,000 hectares. 
The state government has sanctioned Rs 154 crore for Hebbe project last year. The government had even given its administrative approval for the proposal. 

The project will be taken up after collecting suggestions from the forest and wildlife division officials and NGOs working for the protection of wildlife. On completion, the project would usher in green revolution in the taluk.

Fraction in BJP

To a query on difference of opinion within the BJP in Kadur taluk, he said “differences of opinion are common in any political party. However, no injustice will be meted out at any party worker. The problem will be solved within the party.” 

To another query on Dr Y C Vishwanath of not contesting the next election, he said 
“I will be the BJP candidate from Kadur in the next Assembly election. People have identified my work in the taluk. Those who can not digest my popularity are spreading rumours against me.” 

He said that he has appealed to the Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, to consider his name while appointing chairman for various Boards and Corporations in the state.
