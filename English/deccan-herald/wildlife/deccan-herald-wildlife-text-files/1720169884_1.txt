Music producer and composer Ricky Kej visited Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre, run by Wildlife SOS, recently. 

He spent time interacting with the Wildlife SOS staff to get an insight into their efforts in conserving wildlife and caring for the sloth bears. The Bannerghatta centre houses 78 rescued bears. Sloth bears are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The staff gave Ricky a tour of the centre and the bear enclosures, following which he accompanied them in a fruit-feeding session.

Ricky said, “I am amazed at the fabulous work that Wildlife SOS is doing for sloth bears and other wildlife species under their care. Not only have they rehabilitated these beautiful bears, but also helped the community that was associated with the bear dancing practice.”
