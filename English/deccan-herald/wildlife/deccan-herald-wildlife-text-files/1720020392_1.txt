According to sources, the lion named Suresh had been suffering from a chronic injury for the last six months. Despite attempts by a team of veterinarians to save the lion, it died. The lion’s age was also said to be a cause for its death.

The lion was brought from Vandalur Zoo in Chennai in 1997 for breeding purpose as the Tyavarekoppa sanctuary did not have a single male lion then. Interestingly, Suresh was reluctant to mingle with the lioness. 

The death of Suresh has reduced the number of male lions to one in the sanctuary.          ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to Deccan Herald, Deputy Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) T J Ravi Kumar said, the average life span of lions is 17-23. At present, the sanctuary has four lions, including a female cub. Of the four lions, one is male and the remaining are female.
