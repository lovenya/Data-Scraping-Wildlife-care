A nine-year-old white tiger which got into a scuffle with two Royal Bengal tigers at the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) here on Sunday succumbed to injuries on Wednesday night.

According to veterinarians, Shreyas was showing signs of recovery till Wednesday evening. “But around 8 pm, Shreyas had severe respiratory problems after which he collapsed.

Postmortem reports showed severe injuries to the spine. He even had tooth craters near his spine,” Sujay S, wildlife veterinarian, BBP, told DH.

The postmortem also revealed that Shreyas had punctured his thoracic region. He had compression in his spinal cord, bite marks and spinal cord collision. The spine was completely inflamed.

Sujay said that Shreyas was being administered antibiotics for the last three days. Until Wednesday evening, he was able to stand, had started eating and drank water. The kind of injuries Shreyas suffered is normally not seen during fights in the wild, said Sujay.

Normally, when big cats fight they hurt their forelimb, jaws and even suffer broken teeth. Spinal injuries are rare. Shreyas’s teeth were intact. He had suffered injuries to the jaw and left forelimb.

Another white tiger Vinay and two Royal Bengal tigers Rajendra and Raja are recovering from Sunday’s scuffle.

Vinay has scratches on his back. He was quick to realise that he cannot overpower his rivals and stepped back.

But Shreyas did not get a chance. He was completely overpowered by Rajendra and Raja, said another veterinarian. Rajendra has no injuries while Raja has scratch marks.

Shreyas was born in BBP on January 24, 2008. With his death, the white tiger count in BBP has come down to five. The BBP has 26 Royal Bengal tigers.
