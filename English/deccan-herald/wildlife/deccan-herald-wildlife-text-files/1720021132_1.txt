The farmer took the extreme step to create fear and panic among other monkeys and teach them a lesson.

 “We have asked our field officials to conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report as early as possible. Action will be initiated as per the law after submission of the report,” a senior district forest official said.

Wild monkeys are protected species and killing them is a criminal offence under the Wildlife Protection Act.

The farmer, Sukaman Ganda, a resident of Katigaon village in the Kundei panchayat of the backward district, has been worried since long over the crop loss because of the wild monkeys. 

Therefore, he decided to trap some of them and managed to catch one. However, after catching the animal, he was struck by an unique idea. He took the monkey to a tree top and hanged it to death. He kept the body in a hanging position for a long time so that other monkeys can see it and get scared.
