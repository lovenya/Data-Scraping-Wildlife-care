More than nine lakh migratory birds had congregated on Chilika Lake, Asia’s biggest brackish water lagoon, this winter. Interestingly, the arrival of the avian guests in the picturesque wetland was also delayed by almost two weeks.

Officials in charge of the lake have attributed this phenomena of delayed arrival and early departure to increase in temperature. “The hot and humid weather conditions could be responsible for the early departure of the migratory birds from Chilika Lake,” said an official in the wildlife wing of the state forest department.

Entire Orissa, particularly the coastal and southern belt of the state where the water body is located, is currently experiencing unexpected hot weather conditions with the maximum temperature hovering around three to four degrees above the normal level. On Sunday, the day temperature had touched to 37 degrees Celsius in some of the coastal districts.
According to a report from Chilika, the early departure of migratory birds had hit the local tourism sector hard as there has been a sharp fall in the arrival of tourists. “During this time of the year many tourists visit, however, as the birds have started leaving the lake, there has been a sudden fall in the tourists’ inflow,” said an official.ADVERTISEMENT
