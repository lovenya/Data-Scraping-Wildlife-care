In less than 48 hours, two male tigers died in separate incidents in the tiger reserves of Sariska and Ranthambore in Rajasthan, officials confirmed.  ADVERTISEMENT In Khandar area near Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur district, a 13-year-old tiger died on Tuesday after he was rescued from a village. Chief Conservator of Forest (Sawai Madhopur) confirmed, "The tiger strayed from the forest to a village. A team from the Forest Department tranquilised and shifted him to a forest area. But within some time he died".    In another incident, a   four-year-old male feline was found dead in a farm near the Sariska Forest Reserve in Alwar district on Monday. Prima facie reason suggests he died of strangulation after getting stuck in a wire trap, placed by a farmer to prevent wild animals damaging his crop. Govind Bharadwaj, Chief Conservator of Forest (Alwar) said, "The farmer had surrendered to the Forest Department and was booked under the Wildlife Protection Act."    However, post-mortem reports of the two tigers are awaited.
