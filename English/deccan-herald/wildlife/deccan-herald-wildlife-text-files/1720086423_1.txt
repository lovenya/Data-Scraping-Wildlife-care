Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday laid a roadmap to woo tourists away from Goa’s beaches to the hinterland, even as he resolved to restart the beleaguered mining industry in his budget speech.ADVERTISEMENTSawant’s budget had an outlay of Rs 24,467 crore out of which Rs 17,097 crore was dedicated to revenue expenditure, while Rs 7,369 crore was earmarked for capital expenditure."One of the priority and focus areas of my government is to make efforts to boost eco-tourism in the hinterland, especially in and around incredibly rich forests and wildlife areas of the state," the Chief Minister said in his budget speech."For this purpose, we will come up with a 'Eco-tourism Policy' which will lay emphasis on active participation of local people to provide them gainful employment opportunities. Adequate publicity of eco-tourism sites and facilities will also be made through various platforms, including social media," Sawant said.Sawant also said that the state treasury would benefit by Rs 650 crore through harvesting of iron ore dumps which are a part of the landscape in the state’s mining belt.Mining dumps are essentially mountainous heaps of low grade iron ore dumped by mining companies near their mining leases over the decades. There are currently over 736 million tons of iron ore dumped in mountain-like heaps in Goa’s mining belt.The Chief Minister also said that the budget proposed no fresh taxes, adding that the focus of his government was to plug gaps in revenue collection.“In  this year, I do not propose to levy any additional taxes on our Goans but I will work thoroughly to get in more reforms in various revenue generating departments. Over these years, I have realised that increasing revenue does not necessarily imply increasing the taxes but also plugging revenue leakages and undertaking reforms which will curtail the expenditure on redundant activities,” Sawant said.He added that his government would introduce various reforms, rationalise tax slabs on various components and undertake strict enforcement measures in order to mobilise additional revenue to the State treasury.Check out the latest videos from DH:
