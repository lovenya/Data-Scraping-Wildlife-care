Whether it is yoga, moksha or religious sacraments, beliefs and closely knit family system, all have been the core issue of inquisitiveness among the people in the world. The contrasts and commonness have been instrumental in building unique bond and making India ever stronger. 

Sabine Vdm and Helga from Holland and Kirsten Spielmann and Daliah from Germany who have landed in Manipal under exchange programme ‘Millennium development goal’ under Community health nursing of Manipal College of Nursing, zealously unravelled the facts that drew them towards India.

On the other hand, German culture is synonymous with literature, music and art. German culture is also enriched with religious influences. It is carved under the influences of Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim religions. German cuisines are a vital part of German culture.

Rightly called as one of the jewels of Europe, its stunning 17th century canals, Holland has reservoirs of unspoiled natural reserves, beautiful beaches, wildlife and charming villages. 

Holland is a name given to a region in the western part of the Netherlands. The term is often used to refer the entire Netherlands. Holland consists of two Dutch provinces, South Holland and North Holland. This area includes country’s capital Amsterdam and Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port.

There is much more about Holland than clogs and windmills. Holland is a complex nation, where family is seen as the foundation of social structure. The people have very simple life and let live ethos with which they live by. Outward display of wealth amongst Holland people is not common as there is emphasis within the Holland culture over financial equality. 

Sabine Vdm and Helga from Holland and Kirsten Spielmann and Daliah from Germany, who are studying in Hanza University, Holland, share their experiences before the readers of City Herald. Excerpts of the interview:

Why did you choose India despite the fact that you had many options to go under exchange programme?

Yes, we had many options to study in other parts of the world like Africa, Philippines and Myanmar. It was our dream to come to India to share the unique cultural bond that exists here. India as whole is something interesting. We just wanted to see India. We had heard many things about India and its amazing civilisation that would have been impossible for us to experience staying outside India. Moreover, we had gone through the project done by our seniors and were inspired by the work and the training imparted here.

How would you analyse the standard of education imparted here in contrast to Holland and Germany? Is education in India (Manipal) is cheap?

There is a big difference. It is very cheap studying in India. It is three times as much we pay in our country against what we pay in India. We find the education in India is of high quality when compared to Holland and Germany. Here it is so much more to know and the syllabus goes in depth of the topic related. We find students always studying and seriously thinking and discussing with each other. Students are ambitious.

What are your experiences in India?

We had no difficulties coming over here except for two reasons. Or else it is really great. People are always willing to help. They make sure that you find solution to your problems. They respect the foreigners. They are also so curious about us and they come to us to know each other in very respectful manner.

What are your bad experiences?

Sabine: I was robbed when I was in Goa. I had to face many problems when I lost my bag.
Daliah: People are very slow and inactive. Work here is time consuming. No systematic way of approach for the work carried out. When you order for food in restaurant, one has to wait for a long time.

Which places did you visit in India?

Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Gokarna, Mangalore and Mumbai. All places are pretty and fabulous. 

How would you like to describe North and South India with respect to people and their culture?

People in North are more open minded like their culture. Everything is open and they are less reserved. While in south India, people are conservative. It is totally different when it comes to their behavior. South Indians are traditional when compared to north Indians.

Something about the taste of Indian food?

It is too spicy. We were sick from food poisoning in the beginning. Now we got adjusted.

 Sweet lassi is yummy. We all love sweet lassi. Here we get different kinds of bread that tastes very different from what we get in Holland and Germany. The uniqueness of Indian food lies in different way of eating.

Did you like Indian dress?

We loved the way of dressing. It is superb and we are really mesmerised with the beauty of Indian dress. We have already bought salwars and are planning to go for sari. It is good feeling when you drape yourself in a sari.

Describe India as you feel…

Contrast, multicultural and traditional. There is contrast and extremes hidden in everything and that is the beauty. You come across nice buildings and richness on one side and extreme poverty on the other side. We find contrast culture wise, behaviours of people, in tradition, food every where there is contrast. We see extreme tradition and also excessive westernisation. We see people who are draped in traditional attires and also people in western outfits that we really don’t dare to wear in Germany and Holland. Besides, India is developing everywhere and in all aspects.

What would you like to take back home from India?

Besides sweet memories we would like to take along with us the special features like respect for each other and elders, hospitality caring and protective environment that we rarely come across anywhere in the world. The wonderful family system we miss back at home.

Would you like to recommend India for your friends?

We will recommend. It is a nice experience coming to India.ADVERTISEMENT
