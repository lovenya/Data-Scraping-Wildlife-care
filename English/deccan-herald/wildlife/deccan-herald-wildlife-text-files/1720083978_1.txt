Therefore, everyone must take a pledge to protect nature and not to cause harm to other living beings, he said.He further said, “Most of the natural calamities are in fact man-made. These calamities have been taking place owing to too much of interference of man in ecologically sensitive regions.”S V Narasimhan felt there is a need for everyone to ponder on whether we have been contributing back to nature, after receiving everything from it.Greed, ambition and violence of human beings have been resulting in the plundering the natural resources, he said and warned of calamities of higher scale if the destruction of forests and wildlife continues.Inaugurating the virtual programme, district Kannada Sahitya Parishat former president T P Ramesh said that the suffering of human beings is the result of the destruction of nature.We had been destroying forests.
