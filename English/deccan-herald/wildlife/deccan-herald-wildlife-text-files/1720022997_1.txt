Nature has created all living things to be free but unfortunately much against this law of nature, some animals have been kept as captives in a Mutt near Balehonnur. Blackbucks, deer, antelopes have been leading lives of captives in this Mutt, thanks to expensive hobbies of some spiritual heads here.

All of these animals are used to running freely in open space. 

The Blackbuck has been living in the shed with a rope passed through two nostrils, as done in case of the cattle to tame them. The food given to the animals is same as that given to the devotees. One of the visitors to the Mutt says that even if the animals have lost their way and entered the premises, it is wrong to have kept them confined to the shed. “It is clear violence of animal rights,” he said.

Blackbuck has been listed in Schedule-1 of endangered species but the plight in which this endangered animal has been kept will make anybody grieve. Further this animal survives and feeds itself on fresh grass. However, at the Mutt it is fed with white rice-rasam/sambar, Payasam etc which the animal’s digestive system will not accept.

It is said that these animals were brought to the Mutt by tourists and forest watchers as young ones rescued from streets of the town. 

However, sources in the Mutt say that the animals are taken care of by feeding them food, water, green grass etc in large quantities. “The devotees coming to the Mutt too love to spend time with these animals. The animals would have died on the street or would have been killed by poachers if they were not brought to the Mutt,” said the source.

As per the Wildlife Act caging or confining the wild animals by any individual is a punishable offence. In case anybody violates the Act, then legal action can be initiated against them,” said Koppa Deputy Conservator of Forest Manjunath Chavan.

Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust Managing Trustee D V Girish said that no wild animal can be captured by any individual. In case they find an animal, they have to either hand over the animal to forest department or make arrangements to release the animal to its natural habitat.
