Jamuna, a Royal Bengal tigress, who had slipped out twice from its enclosure in Kamla Nehru Zoo here during past fortnight, has been shifted in a cage following the latest such incident yesterday.

The jail authorities suspect that Jamuna's behaviour is abnormal and have roped in wildlife experts.

"As a preventive measure, 'Jamuna' was shifted in a cage that is put up in the enclosures of white tigers, to ensure overall safety of zoo. The tigress would remain in cage for next one month," Zoo in-charge Uttam Yadav told PTI today.

In latest such incident, the big cat stepped out of its enclosure yesterday when it was opened for carrying out some repair work.

"Jamuna slipped out of the enclosure second time in fortnight yesterday. This shows the tigress is behaving abnormally," Yadav said, adding that a tiger 'Lucky' was also living in the same enclosure with 'Jamuna' but it never tried to escape.

The officer said wild life experts are being consulted about the feline's behaviour.

Earlier on November 27, the tigress had come out of its enclosure by jumping over the fence, creating panic in the zoo.

However, no visitor was present during yesterday's incident as it was a holiday for the zoo, which is managed by Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC).
