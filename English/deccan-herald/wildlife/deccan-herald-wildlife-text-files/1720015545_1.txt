As on August 31, 2010, a total of 3,147 forest right claim applications were accepted, of which 808 applications have ben settled. Title deeds are being made ready for the approved applications.

Review

He said that as many as 707 applications from 27 tribal haadis in Nagarahole National Wildlife Park area will be reviewed because forest department had evicted the tribal families from the National Park limits and these people have come relocated themselves in the forest areas again. Hence, it has been decided to provide them title deeds for the land where they are living now. However, the tribals had demanded the authorities to provide title deeds over the land in the national park limits, earlier. The tribals who have now settled outside the park area on forest land are now impeding the survey works. Hence, the submitted 707 applications will be reviewed, he said.

Further, since there is obstruction in settling 57 community claim applications from forest dwellers, Government has been asked to give a monthâ€™s time for this settlement. Accordingly, 17 applications have come from Madikeri, 8 from Somwarpet and 32 from Virajpet. 

Rejected

As many as 1,575 personal claim applications (852 applications from village-level Forest Rights Committee and 723 from sub division level) have been rejected. He said that the tribals will have to mandatorily submit two documents proving that they have had occupancy over the said land before December 13, 2005. The applications of the tribals who have failed to submit these documents have been rejected at village level Forest Rights Committee and sub division level committees.

With regard to allegation levelled by the tribals that lesser area of land is being distributed to the Tribal, thereby violating the Act, he said that they can provide title deeds only upto 10 acre of land to one individual, according to the Act. Elaborating on this, he said that even if a person had 20 acre land with him before December 13, 2005, he will get right over only 10 acre.

Applications

A total of 3,147 applications were received of which 877 applications were received from Madikeri, 441 applications from Somwarpet and 1829 applications from Virajpet.ADVERTISEMENT
