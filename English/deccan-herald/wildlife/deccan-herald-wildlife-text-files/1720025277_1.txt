Alcohol lovers who now enjoy their drink at the Mahatma Gandhi Park in Chikmagalur is becoming a nuisance for the general public.

ADVERTISEMENTPeople of all ages were visiting the park situated in front of the District court and Krishnarajendra library.

Many visit the park for their morning and evening walk, children visit the park to play. Many organisations also stage protests and organise meets in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue inside the park.

Every year on Gandhi Jayanthi, the district administration organises all religious prayers. 

However, in the recent days the public place created to bring in peace is becoming a headache for the public. 

Every evening people are seen sitting on the benches in the park with a bottle of beer. After their drink, they leave the plastic glasses, bottles, cigarette packs on the benches.

Some even break the glass bottles and the glass pieces will be scattered in the park.

The senior citizens, children can not move freely in the park. The empty liquor bottles is setting a bad example for the children, grieved the citizens.

The citizens have submitted a memorandum requesting the concerned authorities to ban alcohol consumption inside the park.

 The road to Mullayanagiri has been polluted with alcohol bottles and plastic.

 This is hazardous for the wildlife. Action should be taken by the concerned authorities, requested the citizens.
