What caught the attention of many at the fest was the theme Go Greek. The students also adopted many environment-friendly measures during the fest, which had the message Go Green.

Around 80 colleges from across the country, including RVCE, MSRIT, CMRIT, BMS, Christ, UVCE, took part in a host of technical and cultural events making it one of the most successful events of the year and taking home the message of nature conservation. “We are determined to spread this message to more than one lakh students and create awareness on environment-related issues. For that, we have formed a club in our college called Greenoholics. Through this club, we have been able to plant many saplings in the City. And Aatmatrisha has provided us the perfect platform to strengthen our commitment towards this cause,” says Jawahar, one of the co-ordinators of the event, who also composed a melodious jingle for the fest. 

The first day of the fest saw some technical events in programming, networking, communication, bio-informatics, robotics and mathematics. The cultural events took off with Skimos, a mime contest, which tested the abilities of the contestants to emote and express.  The street play event called Plebian Play provided an opportunity for the young brigade to raise their voice against corruption, child labour and infanticide. The music enthusiasts displayed their talents through an array of events like Western acoustics, Western solo, light music and others. The light music contest was enjoyed and appreciated by everyone.

The dance events unravelled some graceful movements and excellent choreographic talents. These apart, the students also tried their hands in debate, quiz, face-painting, rangoli and creative writing.  The second day saw bands such as Beat Gurus and Aurko from Kolkata enticing the crowd with their power-packed performances. A fashion show, conceptualised and presented by the PESIT students with the theme Go Greek, also received much appreciation. “This festival was really helpful in many ways. As I am interested in photography, I made the best use of a photography workshop conducted by wildlife photographer Jayant Sharma and took part in the competition as well. This year, we have not hired any professional photographers to take  pictures of the events. We, students, shot everything with our cameras,” said Aditya Kamath, who is a member of the college photography club Pixels.ADVERTISEMENT
