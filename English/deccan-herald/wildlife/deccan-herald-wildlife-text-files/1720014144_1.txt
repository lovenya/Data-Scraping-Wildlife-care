The villagers who are scared after the incident, have urged the department to nab the tiger at the earliest. Senior officials have visited the spot and assured to nab the tiger at the earliest.  

The tiger had attacked a cow shed belonging to Ramesh Chittiyappa and killed the cow.

In the meantime, Zilla Panchayat member Aramanamada Ranjan Changappa urged the authorities to nab the tiger at the earliest. 

Speaking to presspersons after visiting the spot, he said “tiger menace is on rise in Devanooru, Nittur. Two cows belonging to Aramanamada Sunil were killed by a tiger recently. A cub was seen roaming near Naramaneshwara temple during day time on Tuesday. Two calves belonging to Mandemada Ponnappa were killed by tiger last week.”
The residents are already worried over wild elephant menace in the region. Now the appearance of the tiger has increased their worries. Owing to the fear, labourers are not coming forward to work in fields.
