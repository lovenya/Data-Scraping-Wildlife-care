The vanishing grazing land in the name of development is not only dealing a blow to herbivores, but also to carnivores like Indian grey wolf, said Senani of renowned wildlife photographer duo Kripakar- Senani.

ADVERTISEMENTDelivering a lecture on wolf as part of series of education programme organised by Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens here on Tuesday,  Senani unveiled his study on wolves at northern part of the State.

The wildlife expert succinctly said that wolves and shepherds are inter-related. It’s no more a secret that the wolves hunt sheeps and goats during grazing. 

They are the only ones left (for food) to feed on with decreasing land holdings and also grazing lands. Even the shepherds are unmindful of the fact that they lose a minimum of 15 to 16 sheeps and goats to wolves every year. 

This is mainly due to the deep rooted belief in them that ‘killing wolves brings bad omen to their families.’ More than that, they strongly believe it (hunting sheep or goats) as right of wolves. That’s also the reason the shepherds do not hanker either for relief or resort to kill the animal.

Senani said ‘though it’s a blind belief, it has helped the survival of wolves.’ It also explains the large heartedness of shepherds at the time of penury. 
 
The dwindling green is the cause of concern as it’s not only snatching the livelihood of shepherds, but also the wolves, Senani lamented. The government also has a share in the blame as measures to retain grasslands are not being initiated,citing the reason of social forestry. 

Senani traced the extinction of wolves to 60 lakh years ago. There are numerous instances where men across the globe indulged in hunting the species. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The family of wolves is expanding again. They are sensitive and agile hunters, Senani added.

Chairman of Zoo Authority of Karnataka Nanjunda Swamy, executive director B P Ravi and others were present.
