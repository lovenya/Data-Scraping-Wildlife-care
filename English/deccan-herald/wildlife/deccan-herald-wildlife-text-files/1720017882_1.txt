With only the name give it a royal outlook, the environs of the park can only make you wonder why it was named so.

Even though the park once boasted of a beautiful fountain, it is now rusted.
 As soon as one enters the park, the tepid smell emanating from the drainage, prevents people from going near it.Hundreds of people flock the park in the morning and evenings - not because it is attractive; it’s because that they have no other option.

The CMC has earmarked Rs one crore in its budgets year after year. 
This year it has set aside Rs three crore. Yet there is no visible evidence that work will start to maintain the park.

New hope
ADVERTISEMENTHowever, a proposal by the Forest Department will probably give new hope to people. Forest officials are planning to improve the conditions at Gendkatte Wildlife Sanctuary. In the first installment, birds and swans have been introduced at the sanctuary.The increase in population of deers to 67 has also brought cheer to the forest officials. 

The sanctuary also boasts of a high number of peacocks.With a rock garden and view point already inaugurated, Forest Minister C H Vijayshankar’s recent visit to the city and promise to take necessary measures to improve the sanctuary has led to forest officials creating a proposal.

With 124 hectares of forest cover, the officials plan to fence the entire area. Assistant Conservator of Forests Purushottam Prabhu said that the department plans to cut the Eucalyptus Trees and plant medicinal and endemic plants.

As the peacocks are found in abundance, a ‘Peacock Sanctuary’ are also being planned. A proposal with an estimated cost of Rs 126 lakh has been sent to the State Government.
Prabhu hopes to develop the sanctuary within a span of five years. He also hopes to include private institutions in its venture to improve the facilities.
