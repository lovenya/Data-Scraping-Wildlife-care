A two-year-old tigress was found dead near Talgaon village under Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh.

ADVERTISEMENTThe caracass was found on Friday by a team of forest officials who were monitoring wild cats in the reserve, officials said here on Saturday.

The team had radio collared the tigress some months back and named it as P-214, they said. There were no external injury marks on the body. The cause of the death was not known yet.

Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna on Saturday emphasised on tiger conservation and directed officials concerned to constitute a panel for rehabilitation of villagers of Sunderkhal in Jim Corbett park.

“Tigers are assets of the hill state. We should ensure people’s participation in protection of the wildlife,” he said at a meeting of the governing body of Corbett Tiger Conservation Foundation at the secretariat here. 

He also stressed on encouraging research programs related to Corbett Tiger Reserve and imparting environmental education to students.

The chief minister directed the officials to “set up a separate committee for rehabilitation of villagers living in Sunderkhal Village of Corbett park”. 

Earlier in the day, at a state wildlife advisory board meeting, Bahuguna directed the officials to increase the compensation paid to villagers for their cattle killed by wild animals on the ground that it is insufficient, an official statement said.

Bahuguna also approved rehabilitation of two pairs of tigers at western part of Rajaji Park from Corbett park.
