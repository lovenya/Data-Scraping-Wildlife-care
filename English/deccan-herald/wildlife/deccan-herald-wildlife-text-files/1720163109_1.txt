The Bhitarakanika wildlife and marine sanctuary in Odisha has been shut for the salt-water crocodile mating season. The ban has been imposed for three months and the park will re-open on August 1. 

“The restriction has been put in place to provide the crocodiles a disturbance free environment during their courtship and nesting period”, B P  Acharya, the divisional forest officer (DFO) in charge of the national park, said. 

The ban has been imposed in all the three forest blocks inside the national park - Bhitarakanika, Dangamal and Ragadapati- which are known as crocodile infested areas.
Sources in the wildlife wing of the state forest department said, apart from providing a tranquil environment to the crocodiles for their mating and nesting, the ban has also been imposed for the security and safety of the visitors. 

“During their mating and nesting period the reptiles usually turn more violent and remain on attacking mood. The restriction has been put in place to prevent any kind of danger to the lives of the people visiting the national park,” said a wildlife official. 

Bhitarakanika, which is famous for housing the world’s biggest nesting ground for endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles, is also home to a large number of estuarine crocodiles. During an annual census by the state government in January, it was found that the national park was home to as many as 1,665 crocodiles. ADVERTISEMENT
They include a few big ones whose length is more than 20 feet. There was a 23-feet long reptile which, according to forest department officials, was the biggest surviving salt-water crocodile in the world.
