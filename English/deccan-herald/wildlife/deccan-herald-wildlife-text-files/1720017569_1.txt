The hospital will come up on a 7,000-8,000 sq ft area inside the rescue centre of the park. Biodiversity Conservation India Limited, in association with Zero Energy Design, will develop an eco-friendly structure amid rich biodiversity.

According to Aniket Kibe, the architect of the building, the hospital has been designed in such a way that it does not upset the park’s natural topography and vegetation. 

“The building will consume 20 per cent less energy and water compared to conventional buildings... even the instruction boards will be made of eco-friendly materials,” says Aniket. The building will have various water conservation techniques such as rain water harvesting and waste water management, solar back-up and solar water heaters. 

Waste management

Organic waste management will also be an integral part of the structure. The landscape strategy consists of drought-resistant plants, use of local species, drip irrigation and water bodies. Passive cooling system will be adopted in the building and ample light and ventilation filters through the central courtyard.

The hospital’s ground floor has facilities such as examination rooms, a highly equipped operation theatre, X-ray room, medical gas facility, recovery room, pantry and a post-mortem room. The first floor houses the supporting hi-tech laboratory. 

Accommodation facilities for doctors and staff are also provided with outdoor dining areas and terrace gardens.

The total estimated cost of the project is around Rs 1.2 crore. Work will begin in one-and-a-half month and is expected to be completed in a year’s time, added Aniket.

Modern laboratory

Serological, morphological, chemical, including histopathology, tests which were otherwise done at the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals can be done at the new laboratory. A BBP staffer said the new lab will have its own DNA sampling unit as well.

“We are dependent on laboratories in Hyderabad for DNA fingerprinting tests to be done on pelts that are seized by police in poaching cases. Now, we will have our own facility toconduct the tests,” said the staffer. The BBP had come under severe criticism from the public ever since three tigers, including a cub, had died due to salmonella infection caused by contaminated meat.

Since then, there have been various efforts to revamp the park and its facilities at the rescue centre and safari. The park has two vets, and Dr R Raju has been recently appointed its new executive director.’
