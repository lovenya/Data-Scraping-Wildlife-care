The introduction of these two new flights connecting the Sri Lankan capital are in addition to the existing daily Chennalâ€“Colombo service which was launched in 2004 when the airline started its international operations.

The airline will be operating with 170-seater Boeing 737-800 aircraft, offering eight Premiere and 162 economy class seats, on Delhi-Colombo and Mumbai-Colombo sectors.

On Delhi-Colombo sector, flight 9W 257 will depart Delhi at 1330 hours and arrive in Colombo at 1705 hours (local time) and on the return leg, 9W 258 will depart Colombo at 0750 hours (local time) and reach Delhi at 1130 hours.

Similarly, flight 9W 256 will take off from Mumbai daily at 0210 hours reaching Colombo at 0445 hours (local time), and flight 9W 255, on its return leg will leave Colombo at 2020 hours and reach Mumbai at 2255 hours.

This enhanced connectivity, commencing with the winter schedule, to this SAARC country will connect Jet Airways' two strategic hubs -- Delhi and Mumbai, a Jet Spokesperson said.

"Sri Lanka is fast emerging as a highly rated global tourism destination and we are happy to offer our guests seamless connections to several destinations across our network, through our important gateways points -- Mumbai and Delhi, and at the same time strengthen air connectivity to destinations within the SAARC region," Nikos Kardassis, CEO of Jet Airways said in a statement.

Jet is delighted to provide direct links from the financial and the national capital to the Emerald Isle, he added.

India and Sri Lanka boast of strong trade ties ranging from textiles to food-processing and agri-food business.

Sri Lanka is fast becoming a top tourism destination for holiday and leisure travellers across the globe and is known for its beaches, magnificent landscapes, ecologically-wondrous forests and abundance of wildlife.ADVERTISEMENT
