The Shivamogga Wildlife Division in Karnataka named a baby elephant after late Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar. The step was taken in memory of the late actor’s visit to Sakrebailu Elephant Camp to shoot a wildlife documentary in early October. The two-year-old baby elephant has been given the name ‘Puneeth’ to remember the valuable contribution of the late actor to the Forest Department. ADVERTISEMENT
