I had an occasion recently to journey by road from Mananthvady, Wayanad district, Kerala to Bangalore via Mysore. It is worth nothing that night-time travel through the Rajiv Gandhi National Park is banned.ADVERTISEMENT Commencing our journey by bus at 7.30 am, we entered the national park in 40 minutes. I was quite surprised that there was no entry check for vehicles. The highway cuts through the national park on either side lies thick forests, habitat for many wildlife. 

What impressed me was the display of pictorial signboards all along the highway indicating that it is an elephant habitat. 

Many road humps and rumbler strips ensure that vehicles slowed down at least over these. Visitors are warned not to throw rubbish anywhere. Warnings such as, “Do not get down from your vehicle,” “Do not park your vehicles” are timely in order that visitors take adequate precautions that they are not harmed by wildlife. 

They are also informed that wildlife has a right of way, as it is their natural habitat. Speed limits within the park are indicated for the guidance of drivers. A graphical signboard with a tiger being hit by a speeding vehicle is a reminder that speed indeed kills. 

In fact, there is a case for lowering the speed limit to 40 kmph from the present 50 kmph, which should be strictly enforced through radar control as well as forest guards.
