Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh today wrote to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel asking them to protect reserves from such violations, said ministry officials here.

"The letters have been faxed to both Patnaik and Patel," said an official, adding that the ministry took exception to Panda, who violated Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

The incident of alleged violation of green laws by the Biju Janta Dal (BJD) MP was reported by local media in the first week of this month.

Opposition Congress had demanded a probe into the incident and sought action against the MP, who allegedly flew the chopper at a low altitude over Satkosia, which was declared as a tiger reserve in 2007.

State's wildlife activists had also written to the Environment Ministry seeking action against the MP forÂ  flying at very low altitude without taking permission from the wild life authority, which is home to about 18 Royal Bengal tigers.ADVERTISEMENT
