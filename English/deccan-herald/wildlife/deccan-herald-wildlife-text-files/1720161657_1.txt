Minister for Forests Bâ€ˆRamanath Rai said on Monday that the government was committed to declare sensitive zones in five tiger reserves and 27 wildlife sanctuaries of the State.

He was speaking after inaugurating a tree park on the outskirts of the city.

The minister said that an Assembly committee had been set up for the purpose. The report of the committee would be placed before the next Cabinet meeting, he said. 

It would be sent to the Centre after the Cabinet approval. The committee had delved into aspects like the expanse of the forest areas that should be declared sensitive zones. 

Steps would be taken to ensure that forest dwellers were not affected in the process. Those living on the fringes of the forests need not worry, the minister said. 

Rai said that there was no question of protecting any mining barons, while making the declaration on sensitive zones. ADVERTISEMENTMining licences that harm the environment would be cancelled, the minister said. He said that Karnataka had the distinction of being the State with the highest number of elephants and tigers.

The issue of declaring the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and the Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary as tiger reserves would be discussed at the government level, he said. A decision would be taken after going into the pros and cons, Rai said. 

Facilities had been provided to forest dwellers under the Recognition of Forest Rights Act, 2006, he said. Those eligible would get title deeds and community title deeds, Rai said.

The minister promised to look into the allegations of illegal quarrying on the fringes of the forest in Chamarajanagar and take appropriate action.
