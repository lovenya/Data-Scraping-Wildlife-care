New guest-houses would be built outside the forests for carrying out administrative and other works of the department, the Minister said.

There was a huge demand for accommodation in forest guest-houses from relatives of IFS officers and other higher level officials.

Notices would be served on owners of all existing private resorts to close their operations since they have been causing harmful effects on forests and wildlife, Yogeeshwara said.

To take advantage of tourists visiting wildlife sanctuaries, particularly tiger reserves, resorts have come up in the vicinity of reserved forest areas. Private parties have illegally constructed 30 resorts by encroaching forest areas.

The Departmentâ€™s Principal Secretary would tour wildlife sanctuaries and formulate guidelines to restrict movement of tourists and vehicles inside tiger reserves,he said.
