Earlier, Maharashtra Governor K Sankarnarayanan released the coffee-table book Wildscapes, brought out by Congress Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Lokmat Group of Newspapers Vijay Darda at the Raj Bhawan here.

Ambani said he inherited the passion from his late father Dhirubhai Ambani. Now his son too has become a wildlife enthusiast. "It is in generation and inheritance...my father was very fond of wildlife and both of us would enjoy wildlife in photographs and now my son has taken on to wildlife," he said.

The Reliance Industries chieftain said for sustainable growth it is important to anchor all actions around people, planet and bio-diversity.

"However, in doing so, the meaning of sustainability has to be kept in mind. It has to be made broad-based and encompassing all," Ambani said. He said besides eco-friendliness, it is also important to integrate the aspirations of the people with prosperity.

"You just can't remain eco-friendly. It should holistically integrate the aspirations of the people, planet and also the aspirations of their prosperity," Ambani said.ADVERTISEMENT
