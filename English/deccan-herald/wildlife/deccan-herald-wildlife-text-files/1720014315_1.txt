The full bench comprising  former Chief Justice K G Balakrishnan, Justice Deepak Varma and Justice B S Chauhan, in their interim order, had directed that the possibility of a modality to transport goods with a convoy be worked out. 

The apex court order follows a petition by the Government of Kerala to lift the ban and open the night traffic on National Highway (NH) -212 and NH- 67.
The road was closed on the Karnataka High Court direction of March 9, 2010 upholding the Chamrajnagar Deputy Commissioner’s order with an observation that it is important to close the road during night in the interest of wildlife protection.
Despite a good motorable alternative road (SH 88) which is only 30 kilometer longer to reach north Kerala is available, the Kerala government has argued that the goods vehicles have come to a standstill.

Though the High Court, in its order, had even ordered that any minor repairs on the alternative road be taken up immediately to ensure smooth flow of traffic, the Kerala government, rather than demanding the implementation of the High Court order, is demanding lifting of ban on the night traffic. It is also demanding that the existing national highway through Bandipur be made a four-lane superspeed highway. 
Interesting, neither the State of Karnataka nor the State Forest Department was heard before passing the interim order ex-parte.

To make matters worse, the Forest Department received the Supreme Court order only on June 21, and has been asked to file a response within two weeks from the next date of hearing which is July 14. The Forest Department was left with only six full working days to draft its response to the Supreme Court.
