The State government has given its nod for the construction of an alternative road connecting Mysore and Mananthavadi, bypassing the Nagarahole National Park.

The government released Rs 18 crore for the alternative road last week.  The problem began five years ago when it was proposed to construct a 28.5-km road between Mysore and Mananthavadi to connect Karnataka with Kerala. Fourteen kilometre of the proposed road was to pass through the Nagarahole Park. 

The work was awarded to Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP). With the proposed road dissecting the Nagarahole Park, wildlife experts contended that it was possible to construct an alternative road for at least 10 km out of the 14 km through the Park. Accordingly, a request was made to the KSHIP authorities to take up the work on the alternative route. 

The KSHIP turned down the request on the ground that it was an expensive proposal and that the land for the  alternative stretch was under the control of the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department (RDPR).

Meera Saxena, the then Additional Chief Secretary, directed the KSHIP not to go ahead with the work.

After sustained efforts by wildlife expert Sanjay Gubbi and B J Hosmath, Field Director for Project Tiger and others, the RDPR transferred the land required for alternative road to Public Works Department in August 2010. The work has now gained momentum with the government releasing funds. The proposed alternative road, besides helping wildlife conservation in the Park, also provides connectivity to several nearby villages such as Udbur, Gundatthur, Kharapura, Belthur, Malali, Magge, KR Pura, Hosaholalu, Honnammana Katte etc. 

These villages were bereft of a road connectivity till now.

Conservationists say the alternative proposal will help curb fragmentation of the sanctuaries. A recent study by Sanjay Gubbi and others has found that the traffic on the Mysore-Mananthavadi stretch has increased manifold. 

An environment impact assessment conducted in 2003 recorded 50 vehicles a day and the latest study puts the number of vehicles at 1,150 a day. The Nagarahole National Park, spread over 643 sq km, is home to around 65 tigers and forms part of a larger tiger habitat comprising Bandipur, Mudumalai and Waynad protected areas.
