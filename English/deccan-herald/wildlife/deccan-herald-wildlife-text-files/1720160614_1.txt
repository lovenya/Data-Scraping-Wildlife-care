Aiming to speed up the approval for big ticket investment projects in infrastructure and industry, the Centre has decided to set a timeline for the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and state governments to give clearances.

ADVERTISEMENTThe Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), which has been holding discussion with various stake holders to reduce delay in approving for mega projects, also decided to make the  process, including green and wildlife clearances, transparent.

As per the proposal, within 45 days of filing applications, state level environment impact assessment authority has to start the process of preparing a report. 

Followed by this, an expert appraisal committee (EAC) and state expert appraisal committee report of the particular project have to be finalised and the report has to be made public, sources told Deccan Herald.

The state pollution control board has to organise a public hearing within 45 days of filing applications. 

For expansion of projects within the existing project boundary, 30 days’ time will be granted for environment clearances for site visit and certification.

Besides, the government is also planning to reduce the time from 3 months to 30 days for the MoEF to monitor base line data. On functioning of the EAC, the PMO is of the view that the panel should not keep any files related to any projects beyond 30 days.

Apart from that, the EAC should not look into other studies than standard terms of references before approval. Earlier, the PMO has asked the MoEF to study the possibility of giving green clearances for certain category of projects. 
The government expected that if the proposed plan is implemented, then time to obtain environment clearances will reduce from the average 100 to 60 days for a project.

The proposal says the projects with less pollutants can directly seek environmental clearances from the MoEF, while those with more ecological impact could be referred to the EAC for appropriate recommendation.
