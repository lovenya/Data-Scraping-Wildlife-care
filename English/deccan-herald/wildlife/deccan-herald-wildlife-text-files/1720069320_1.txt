Six teams of police and forest officials on Tuesday had taken up search operation.Santhosh said, “I was not scared but panicked thinking about my parents and friends. From Narayana Bhat’s house at Girigadde (where they had lunch while alighting from Kumaraparvatha to base), there were many routes. I took the wrong route and ended up wandering. I tried to find the way to the base and slept on the rocks for two nights. I did not have any food but had water from waterfalls enroute.”“While searching for the path, I followed a pipeline thinking it will lead me to a village. I followed it and reached Devaragadde,” he explained.“Forest personnel, policemen and locals have faced inconvenience after I went missing. They have helped trace me. I am thankful to them,” he said.Also read — Bengaluru trekker missing during Kumaraparvatha trekNo encounter in the wild“I encountered no wild animals.
