The district administration has failed to curb the menace of illegal homestays being constructed in eco-sensitive regions in the Malnad region of the district, alleged Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust Managing Trustee D V Girish, wildlife activist G Veeresh and environmentalist S Girijashankar.ADVERTISEMENTIn a press statement, the environmentalists said that homestays and resorts are being built at coffee estates and private lands in Mullaiahnagiri plain area.Most of these are illegal. The buildings can damage the eco-sensitive region. Also, the region houses a wide variety of flora and fauna. As the number of tourists increases, the wildlife habitat will be endangered.Building establishments in the region may also cause harm to several streams here, they said.They urged the local Gram Panchayats, pollution control board, Forest Department and the district administration to initiate action against the illegal homestays and resorts.
