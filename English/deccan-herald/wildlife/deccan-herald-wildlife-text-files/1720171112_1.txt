Sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (Forest Cell) and wildlife volunteers raided a private courier agency and rescued spiny-tailed lizards which are concealed in shoe boxes ready to be shipped to Villupuram in Tamil Nadu.

The police said that the spiny-tailed lizards are Scheduled 1 species under the Wildlife Protection Act (as per their biodiversity value). The illegal trade thrives unabated in the city and neighbouring states. This is due to the growing demand for lizards from people who believe they (monitor lizards) possess some medicinal value, they added.

They are herbivorous and are found only in Rajasthan, wildlife enthusiast Sharath Babu said. The parcel was booked from Hosur and expected to be delivered to Tamil Nadu.
