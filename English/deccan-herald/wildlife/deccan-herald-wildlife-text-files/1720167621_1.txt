Four farmers were injured in an elephant attack at Hoogyam forest range, under Male Mahadeshwara wildlife sanctuary near here on Tuesday night.

ADVERTISEMENTThe injured — identified as Nagaraju, Govinda, Chandru and Joguvali — all farmers have been admitted to KR Hospital in Mysuru for treatment. The farmers were on vigil to guard their jowar crop and were said to have been sleeping on a cot under a tree. A tusker that had strayed into the fields lifted the cot, flung it into the air and attacked the farmers in the wee hours.

 They were provided first aid at Koodluru primary health centre and later shifted to KR Hospital. District Lambani Sangha president Krishna Nayak has urged that suitable compensation be provided to the injured. The repeated jumbo attacks have created panic among the residents.

A farmer was killed by a jumbo last year near Hanur. The Forest department personnel had captured the rogue elephant and shifted it out. But, the resurfacing of jumbos in the region has left the people worried. The village residents want the Forest department to act swiftly to curb the menace.

Speaking to Deccan Herald, J Chandru, assistant conservator of forests, MM Hill wildlife division, said the department would decide on the compensation to be provided to the injured, based on the reports by doctors at the KR Hospital, where the farmers are being treated.
