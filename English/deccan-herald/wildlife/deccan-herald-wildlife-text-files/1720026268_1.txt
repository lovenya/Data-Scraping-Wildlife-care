Notwithstanding, emergence of electronic media as a “dominant medium”  for real time news, serious journalism on topical issues by print media  continues to be a popular demand of the people, Vice President M Hamid  Ansari said here on Thursday.

ADVERTISEMENTIn today’s age, the audio-visual media has emerged as a dominant medium for quenching the thirst of the target audience for real time news on current affairs, culture and entertainment.

“Despite this, there remains a real and popular demand for serious publications on topical issues which cannot be substituted by the ‘breaking news’ culture and short-attention span snippets in the domain of the electronic media,” Vice President said after re-launching “Frontline” magazine here at a function.

About the magazine, he said, in its new avatar, it will have attractive photo essays on art, culture, heritage, wildlife, environment and land & people. It will also have new columns on media and literature, snapshots on developments in India, a science notebook besides in-depth analyses of the social, political and economic issues of the day.

Addressing the function, N Ram, former Editor-in-Chief, The Hindu and Frontline assured that the magazine will continue to give voice to the issues that affect the lives of people and remain committed to serious journalism, unaffected by marketing blitzkrieg.
