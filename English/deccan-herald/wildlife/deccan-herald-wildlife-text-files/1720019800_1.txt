D V Girish from Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust and Sridev Hulikere from Wild Cat C Management Trust have claimed that the sensitive forest areas in Mutthodi, Kemmannugundi and Mullayyanagiri are the abode of wild animals. Action must be taken to stop the four-wheeler and two-wheeler races in these areas. 
The rallies disturb the life of these animals. There are all possibilities of the wild animals meeting with accidents during the rallies and several such incidents have happened earlier, said the statement released by the NGOs. 
It added, the Deputy Conservator of Forest must take action to enforce ban on the motor rallies on the road located in the forest area which comes under Bhadra Reserve Forest. 

The local forest staff too should insist the senior officers to take the issue into their notice. ADVERTISEMENT
