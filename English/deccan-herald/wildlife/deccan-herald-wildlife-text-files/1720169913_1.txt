The fire that ravaged Anekadu reserve forest and Kallur Hill in Kodagu district for two days since Thursday, has destroyed 700 acres of forest.

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to Range Forest Officer (RFO)â€ˆRanjan, wildlife, including birds and animals, have been charred at places, while lantana, grass and different species of plants and trees have also been destroyed. Though the fire came under control by Saturday morning, chances of it recurring cannot be ruled out with smoke billowing at a few places inside the forest. Fire personnel are hence camping at the spot.

A total of 700 acres of forest have been destroyed. The heat generated by the fire has hampered firefighting 
operations.
