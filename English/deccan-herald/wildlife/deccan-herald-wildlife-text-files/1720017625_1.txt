These grallatorial species have derived the name flamingo from the Latin word ‘flamma’, meaning flame or fire. Egyptians revere them, as living embodiment of Sun God Ra. They have long necks, skinny legs and generally survive in the caustic environment of volcanic soda lakes. 

Unlike other birds on earth, their beaks have evolved to skim tiny algae from the water’s surface. By swinging their heads sidewise or swishing water through their fat tongues, they siphon water through the filtering plates along the inside of their bills and strap algae, feeding on which gives them their unique pink flame. 

Lake Nakuru’s abundant algae attracts them and their acts on water, described by famous American ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson as “the most fabulous bird spectacle in the world.” The phenomenon invites a constant flow of visitors, making the venue Kenya’s second most-visited national park after Masai Mara, which is often referred to as the Mecca of the animal kingdom. ADVERTISEMENTOur guide-cum-driver Chris allows us to get down from our open-top safari vehicle to walk up to the edge of the water and closely observe the avians in action. There are several varieties of flamingos but only two species known as Greater and Lesser crowd here. With assistance from Chris, we spot them — the Greater type features a pink bill with a black tip, while the Lesser flamingo sports a deep carmine bill and thicker pink plumage. The total flamingo count varies from year to year, but Chris tells us that at times, it stands over two million, though I am not sure how the count is made; may be it is judged by the density of the pinkness. 

With their straw-thin legs, knobby knees and strangely-hooked beaks, they look bizarre if you just angle one of them. And while feeding, they look uncanny as they bend their legs backwards with their head upside down. However, when you frame them en masse, they are surely transformed into an imposing display, which aptly justifies Peterson’s famous claim.  

Getting airborne is not a regular exercise for flamingos, but if lucky, you may witness a few of them taking short, low-height flights before landing back into the water with dramatic splashes. It’s not easy to capture this scene on your camera because when you momentarily see some pink flashes above with the blue sky in the background, you will be so overwhelmed by the beauty of the panorama that like me, you will forget to press the shutter. 

Located 156 km away from Kenya’s capital Nairobi, often referred to as ‘Nai-Robbery’ because of high crime rate, Lake Nakuru was established as a National Park in 1961. The 180 sq km area encompasses the lake and the surrounding landscape made up of marsh and grasslands, alternating with rocky cliffs and stretches of acacia woodland. It’s a part of that Great Rift Valley, the longest rift on the surface of the earth, formed millions of years ago. Being close to Nairobi and with good connectivity, a day trip to the park is possible, but it’s better to stay overnight as the extra time will give you more opportunities to meet some of Africa’s legendary wildlife.  

After reading guide books, I knew that this is the best venue in East Africa to encounter rhinos and the white-legged Rothschild’s giraffe. So, after visiting flamingos, we press Chris very hard to show us the big African beasts. We soon glimpse a group of giraffes, crunching on their staple food — leaves of acacia trees. Earlier in Nairobi, I saw a few of these endangered species at the Rothschild Giraffe Centre where they are protected and nurtured, but the experience of watching the world’s tallest land mammals in their own habitat is a different experience altogether. “Except for elephants, you will be able to see all the other big beasts at the park, provided you have that bit of luck,” said Chris while journeying from Nairobi.  

No doubt luck was on our side. On our way to Nakuru, we spotted zebras, warthogs and impalas, and the moment we stepped into Lake Nakuru Lodge, we were welcomed by crazy baboons and large buffaloes, loitering just outside the boundary fence, electrified to prevent entry. Driving through the park, we kept encountering more and more of them, joined by a plethora of wildebeest, waterbucks and gazelles.  

A key feature of this park is the presence of both black and white rhinos, though there is no colour difference between them; they both have smooth grey skin. The misnomer white is derived from the Dutch word ‘weid’ meaning wide, referring to the world’s second largest mammal’s square-lipped,  wide mouth. You will find them everywhere, most times in pairs. We catch them grazing and parading. In contrast, the black ones, relatively smaller in size, are secretive by nature and prefer to hide in thick woodlands. So, despite several attempts, we failed to track any of them. 

Expert guides like Chris know how to track predators. They judge the behaviour of the herbivores; look at their tracks on roads, and often get radio messages from other guides driving in the area. While looping around the lake, Chris turned his vehicle around a big rock and found a lion with manes drinking water from a narrow waterway. It’s one those scenes that stays in your memory forever. Parked only a few meters away, we watched from our vehicle, the charismatic king of the jungle, quenching his thirst.
