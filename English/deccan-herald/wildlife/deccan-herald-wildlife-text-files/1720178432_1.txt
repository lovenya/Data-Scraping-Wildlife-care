Those who are living within 10 kilometre radius of the sanctuary should obtain permission from the Chief Wildlife Warden for availing license to possess arms.

No new licenses under the Arms Act 1959 shall be granted within a radius of 10 kilometres of a sanctuary without the prior concurrence of the Chief Wild Life Warden, saysÂ  Section 34 of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. 

According to Arms Act, people can avail license to possess arms for self protection and to protect crops from wild animals.

 Based on the report submitted by the police, the DC used to issue permission in the past.

 By making permission from Chief Wildlife Warden mandatory, the issue license may be delayed. 

The district administration has been delaying the process of issuing permission for possessing arms in the recent years.

 Kodagu district has Pushpgiri, Talacauvery and Brahmagiri sanctuaries. There are 57 villages coming within the periphery of these sanctuaries. 

DCF Hanumanthappa told Deccan Herald that as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 Section 34/1, the permission of Chief Warden is essential for receiving arms license. The DC had received eight applications seeking licenses for possessing arms. ADVERTISEMENTAs per the Act, the DC has sent the applications to the Forest department. After the scrutiny of the applications, it will be sent to the Warden. 

The Warden will take further action, he added. 

He said that the Act is not applicable to those who have exemption to possess the arms. Those who have exempted from the provisions of the Act and have obtained possession letter need not apply to the Warden. 

However, they have to register their names in a prescribed format with the forest department.
