But for his most recent expedition, he took the A train.

Munshi-South and two graduate students, Paolo Cocco and Stephen Harris, walked east to the entrance of Highbridge Park, where they met Ellen Pehek, a senior ecologist in the New York City Parks and Recreation Department. They worked their way down the steep slope, past schist boulders and freakish poison ivy plants. The ravine flattened out at the edge of Harlem River Drive. Munshi-South has joined the ranks of a small but growing number of field biologists who study urban evolution, the biological changes that cities bring to the wildlife that inhabits them. 

White-footed mice, stranded on isolated urban islands, are evolving to adapt to urban stress. Fish in the Hudson have evolved to cope with poisons in the water. Native ants find refuge in the median strips on Broadway. Bedbugs, rats and bacteria also mutate and change. 

The mice are the object of Munshi-South’s attention. Since 2008, he and his colleagues have fanned out across the city to study how the rise of New York influenced the evolution of the deer mice.

At Highbridge Park, his students, Cocco and Harris, spread a blue tarp on the forest floor, while Munshi-South walked to an orange flag planted in the ground. He picked up an aluminum box sitting next to the flag and pushed in a door at one end. At the other end of the box crouched a white-footed mouse. The researchers inspected 50 traps laid the day before and found seven mice inside. They plopped each mouse out of its trap and into a bag. They clipped a scale to each bag to weigh the mice. Munshi-South gently took hold of the animals so his students could measure them with a ruler along their backs.

Munshi-South and his colleagues have been analysing the DNA of the mice. He’s been surprised to find that the populations of mice in each park are genetically distinct from the mice in others.

White-footed mice live today in forests from Canada to Mexico. They arrived in the New York City region after ice age glaciers retreated 12,000 years ago. Research by Munshi-South and his colleagues suggests that New York’s white-footed mice, which occupy isolated patches, are adapting to life in the city.

Pollution forces change

Evolution is one of life’s constants. Environmental changes have often steered evolution in new directions. Modern cities like New York have brought particularly swift changes to the environment. European settlers cut down most of New York’s original forest; towns grew and then merged into a sprawling metropolitan region. The chemical environment changed as well, as factories dumped chemical pollution into the water and soil. Pollution has driven some of the starkest examples of evolution around New York. Hudson River fish faced a dangerous threat from PCBs, which cause deformities in fish larvae.

In March, Isaac I Wirgin of New York University Medical Center and his colleagues reported that almost all the tomcod in the Hudson share the same mutation in a gene called AHR2. PCBs must first bind to the protein encoded by AHR2 to cause damage. The Hudson River mutation makes it difficult for PCBs to grab onto the receptor, shielding the fish from the chemical’s harm. The AHR2 mutation is entirely missing from tomcod that live in northern New England and Canada. A small percentage of tomcod in Long Island and Connecticut carry the mutation. Wirgin and his colleagues concluded that once PCBs entered the Hudson, the mutant gene spread quickly.

Bacteria adapt too

Today, scientists can scan the entire genomes of New York’s animals and plants to look for evolutionary changes. Last month, Harris presented new data on white-footed mice at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution. Harris and his colleagues have identified mutations in more than 1,000 genes present in all New York City mice, but missing from mice in Harriman State Park, 45 miles north of the city. Cities attract only a small fraction of evolutionary biologists, who often work in lusher places like the Amazon.

 But urban evolution is attracting more research these days, because cities are fast-growing, and the urban environment is quickly taking over large areas of the earth’s surface.

On a recent afternoon, James Danoff-Burg and Rob Dunn were clambering around in a narrow Broadway median on the Upper West Side. Danoff-Burg, a biologist at Columbia University, was digging up plastic cups from the ivy. Dunn, a biologist from North Carolina State University, was five feet in the air, crouched on a bough of a Japanese maple. He and Danoff-Burg were surveying the median for species of ants. Dunn had spotted Crematogaster lineolata, an ant species that he and Danoff-Burg had never found before in this particular urban habitat.

From his backpack, Dunn pulled out an aspirator, a rubber tube connected to a glass jar. Holding one end of the tube over the ant, he sucked it in. Instead of going into his mouth, the insect tumbled into the jar. Danoff-Burg, Dunn and their colleagues chose to study the medians of Broadway to see how human activity alters biodiversity. In this artificial city, there is no environment more artificial than these medians, which sit on fill that was poured on top of subway tunnels. The scientists have found a blend of ant species, some that have been here since before the city existed, and others that have arrived more recently, hitching rides on ships, planes and trucks. The most common ant Danoff-Burg and Dunn encounter is the pavement ant (Tetramorium caespitum), which came from somewhere in Europe.

In the current issue of Global Ecology and Biogeography, a team of scientists surveyed plant biodiversity in New York and 10 other cities.
