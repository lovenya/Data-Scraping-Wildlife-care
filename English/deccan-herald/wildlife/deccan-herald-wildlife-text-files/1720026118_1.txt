According to a family member, "Billy had been ailing for sometime, largely on account of the infirmities of old age; he passed away late tonight."

Closely related to the Kapurthala family, Billy had settled down several decades ago in his farm, almost in the middle of a thick forest in Lakhimpur-Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh along the Indo-Nepal border.
 
It was entirely on  account of his efforts that this forest was later declared as Dudhwa National Park, which eventually emerged as North India's second largest forest reserve after the world famous Corbett National Park. Earlier, Billy shot into fame after he penned down the story of his pet tigress, 'Tara', whom he raised almost like a domestic animal. Tara, who lived with him for several years in his Tiger Haven remained a major attraction for wildlife enthusiasts from across the globe.

He, eventually let Tara find its home in the wilderness.ADVERTISEMENT
