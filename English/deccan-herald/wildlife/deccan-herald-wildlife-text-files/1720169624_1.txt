Suggestions have been made to conduct the event like the one at Sabarimala in Kerala 
to reduce the pollution levels.

It is considered  the largest tribal religious congregation in the world—with an estimated 10 million people expected to turn up at this year's event. The biennial show had witnessed a congregation of about eight million people two years ago.

They arrive at Medaram, a tribal village, to pray at an open air temple, where two idols of goddesses will be installed only for three days and then shifted to another place for two more years. Medaram in Tadwai mandal is 90 km from Warangal city and 200 km from Hyderabad.

This year’s fair will be held between February 8 and 10. The Andhra Pradesh government has sanctioned Rs 60.25 crore for developing Medaram village. People offer bangaram (jaggery) of a quantity equal to their weight to the idols, during the jatra. It is a festival with no vedic or Brahmanical  influence. Goats and hens are sacrificed in thousands and liquor is consumed around the vast expanse of Medaram village.

Until 1998, the only way to reach Medaram was by a bullock cart. In 1998, the state government 
declared the 1000-year-old festival as official and laid  a pucca road. 

The traffic jam during the festival  can be scary as sometimes the impact is felt on the  60-km stretch national highway leading to Warangal. Medaram jatra is for honouring the goddesses celebrated in the Telangana region. It commemorates the fight of a mother and a daughter, Sammakka and Saralamma, with the reigning rulers against an unjust law.

 It is celebrated in Medaram during the time the goddesses of the tribals are believed to visit them. Medaram is a remote place in the Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of Dandakaranya, the largest surviving forest belt in Telangana.

The largest gathering is also a cause for worry for environmentalists. As Medaram is deep inside the sanctuary, they fear that the event would disturb the wildlife. Besides, a large number of trees will have to be chopped off to accommodate such a large number of people. 

An environment impact assessment report prepared by former executive director of Kerala-based Centre for Water Resources Development and Management K V Jayakumar said that in 2002, as many as 2,000 stalls and sheds were built after cutting down 26,261 bamboo/wood poles brought 
illegally from the forest.

The study noted that in the same year the forest department had felled 220 fully-grown trees for road widening on the Tadwai-Medaram route.

At a recent function, Prof Jayakumar, who was also with the NIT, Warangal, urged the  administration to model the conduct of Medaram fair on the lines of Sabarimala in Kerala by making 
the devotees to reach the distance on foot. “The devotees should be asked to complete the 18-km 
Pasra-Medaram and 16 km Tadwai-Medaram distance on foot. This will eliminate non-serious 
devotees,” he said.

The concern of environmentalists appear to have had no impact, if the movement of the people and preparations are any indication.  To avoid heavy rush in the days ahead, a large number of devotees, including Telangana Congress MPs’ team led by MP K Kesava Rao,  came  to Medaram temple to offer prayers on Sunday.  As a result, vehicular traffic was affected all the way from Medaram Tadwai and Medaram Narlapur routes.

The MPs’ team announced a contribution of Rs 50 lakh for constructing shelter homes for the 
devotees. Shiva Sathi, Laxmi Devara and Pabba are the age-old traditional rituals still practised in the jatra. Shiva Sathi women are considered to be possessed by the goddess. When these women go into trance, childless women flock them to seek  blessings. This blessing process is called “Pabba”. Young unmarried girls too seek blessings of the goddess to get a good husband. Minister for IT and Endowments Ponnala Lakshmaiah said that Rs 55 crore was being spent by different departments on arrangements.

The work were not just for the jatra, but to fulfill various needs of the people. “We are contemplating building two check dams in Jampanna vagu, which will be useful both to farmers and for the jatra,” he said.

He promised to transform Medaram into a tourist place of  importance and said that all facilities will be provided for jatra pilgrims.

Even though the state transport corporation has arranged for 3,159 schedules from Hyderabad and all major towns of the Telangana region, tribals from various parts of the country, particularly Coastal Andhra, have already started arriving in this small village in Tadwai mandal. 

It became apparent that they were flocking to Medaram only to avoid trouble from pro-Telangana agitators during the actual jatra. Last Sunday itself more than 50,000 devotees arrived and pitched their tents. M Padma of Krishna district said she came much earlier as she apprehends trouble during the jatra. “We don’t want trouble from pro-Telangana agitators, we want to offer prayers to the goddess and go back,” she said.

The tribal jamboree, which is celebrated as a state festival, attracts people from Kerala and Chhattisgarh. Saravanan came from north Kerala to offer prayers to the idols. “We had heard a lot about the tribal goddesses. We were overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowds here,” he said. 
Elaborate arrangements have been made for the smooth conduct of the jatra. 

Warangal Collector Rahul Bojja said special teams have been formed to monitor arrangements for the devotees.

Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy along with famous actor and Praja Rajyam Party chief Chiranjeevi have already visited Medaram and offered saree to the goddesses on behalf of the state government. The Chief Minister has promised financial assistance for building a tribal museum at Medaram. TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao and TDP chief Nara Chandrababu Naidu are also likely to visit the village before the commencement of the jatra.
