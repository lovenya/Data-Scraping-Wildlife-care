The medium-range fishing vessel, believed to have sunk off the Sri Lankan coast earlier this year, was spotted within the Gahirmatha marine wildlife sanctuary area in Kendrapada district, some 200 km from here.

"The site was about five km north of Wheeler Island," Divisional Forest Officer Manoj Mohapatra told IANS.Â  India maintains a missile-testing facility on Wheeler Island.

Mohapatra said not a drop of oil was found on the ship and there was no pollution concern "but officials are examining if there is any security concern". 

"It seems to be a completely wrecked ship which was abandoned long back. The ship has no property (on board)," he said.ADVERTISEMENT
