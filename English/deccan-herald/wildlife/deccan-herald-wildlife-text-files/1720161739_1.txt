Nearly 7.62 lakh migratory birds from across the globe flocked to Odisha’s Chilika lake this winter compared to 7.19 lakh last year, according to an annual bird survey.

ADVERTISEMENTChilika lake, Asia’s biggest brackish water lagoon, is considered one of the topmost winter homes in the country for migratory birds. 

The census was conducted by the Chilika wildlife division of the state forest department with assistance from different government and non-governmental agencies, including Mumbai-based Bombay Natural History Society.

The exercise further revealed that there had also been an increase in the number of bird species from 158 last year to 172 this year. 

These migratory species include Eurasian Wigeons and Northern Pintails which flocked to the picturesque lake in large numbers. The numbers of Wigeons and Pintails stood at nearly 1.78 lakh and 1.28 lakh respectively.

The increase in the avian guests has assumed significance because it was earlier apprehended that their number may be lesser this year because of cyclone Hudhud which affected the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh coastline last October.

Near landfall area
A major part of the 1,100 sq km Chilika lagoon is located in southern Odisha’s Ganjam district which borders Andhra Pradesh. 
Though  Hudhud  had made landfall in Vishakha-patnam, it did affect some Odisha districts, including Ganjam. 

Interestingly, the migratory birds started arriving at Chilika much before the onset of winter. 
“The birds usually arrive after the onset of winter. They were expected to arrive late this year and also lesser in number because of Hudhud. However, they have landed early. Now their number has been found to be more compared to last year which has turned out to be a pleasant surprise for us,” said a wildlife official.
