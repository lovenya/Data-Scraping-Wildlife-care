Amidst colourful proce-ssions, meetings and religious discourses, speakers lauded the principles of non-violence and virtue as taught by Mahavira, emphasising its need in today’s world.

Stressing the need for non-violence, demonstrators put up banners discouraging animal slaughter and the necessity of conserving wildlife in order to preserve the eco-system.

A spokesperson of the Karnataka Jain Association, said that the aim of the festival is to understand and imbibe the message of “Ahimsa Paramo Dharma”- non-violence is the highest virtue.

Offerings of milk, rice and fruits were made to the idol which was later consumed by the devotees as prasadam. The day ended with religious discourses  with other cultural activities.ADVERTISEMENT
