'Drona,' the magnificent elephant who took part in Dasara processions in Mysuru during the last three years, died at Mattigodu elephant camp in Nagarahole sanctuary near Titimati on Friday. Heart attack is suspected to be the reason for death.ADVERTISEMENTThe 37-year-old elephant collapsed while drinking water from the water tank in the camp. Mahout Ravi and Kavadi Gundu tried to provide first aid to Drona. But all their efforts went in vain. Drona was in the camp for the last six years. He was captured as a rogue elephant in 2014, in Aluru forest range in Hassan district and was tamed later in Moorkallu camp of Nagarahole National Park. After taming, he was sent to Mattigodu camp, where he was named "Drona" by the mahouts, for his magnificent looks and intelligence.Later on, Drona was used to capture and tame other rogue elephants. His services were utilised in Hassan, Chamarajnagar, Kollegala and Biligiriranganabetta forests. Drona has also helped in capturing tigers.A pall of gloom has descended on Mattigodu elephant camp following Drona's demise.The elephant was laid to rest near the Mattigodu camp, after an examination by Veterinarian Dr Mujib Rehman and Bandipur wildlife division veterinary doctor Dr Nagaraju. The exact reason for the death will be known after the autopsy.
