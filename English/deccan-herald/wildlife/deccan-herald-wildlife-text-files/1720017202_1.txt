"Afghanistan in last 30 years have seen the massive destruction of wildlife-- of trees, rivers, soil and all that we depend on," Karzai said here today while addressing the 11th Delhi Sustainable Development Summit inaugurated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

He pointed out that such a phenomenon happens in his country not only because of climate change, but also because of 30 years of war.

Recalling his childhood days in Kabul, the 54-year-old Afghan President said, "It was the crispest weather in the world with plenty of rain and snow. Lately, we have had neither snow nor rain.. It is polluted... It is no longer breathable air."

Karzai was moved by the Upanishad lines recited by Singh which talked about "peace on earth, peace in space.... peace for trees, peace towards cattle, peace towards goats."

He said the Prime Minister spoke about peace for earth, sky, trees, peace towards cattles, towards wildlife "but the continuing war and bombings in Afghanistan also destructed and eliminated the country's human capital."

Karzai said the Western influence in the war-torn nation also had an adverse effect on its people as the western money flow brought the culture of consumerism.

"We, as citizens of this world, will not do better for ourselves or leave a better world for future generations if we continue with the craze for more comfort, more expensive living and more consumerism," Karzai said.

He said the South Asian community and the world at large should deal with the impacts of climate change.

The President said the time had come for the much-discussed regional energy projects to become a reality.

"We also believe that it is time that we collaborate more effectively to tap renewable sources of energy, which our region has in abundance," Karzai added.ADVERTISEMENT
