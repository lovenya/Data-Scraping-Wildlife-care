Speaking with the media persons, he said that the results of ZP and TP elections are not unexpected. “We all knew that BJP will emerge victorious in the election, as it is quite natural for BJP to win after undertaking so many developmental programmes and projects in the State. 

Despite prone to severe criticisms from the JD(S) and the Congress, the party paid no heed to criticisms but only aimed at development. Now with the victory of the party in the election, the BJP has more responsibility on its shoulders.”  Appreciating five MLAs in the district, he said that they all have worked to provide road and drinking water facility to the population. 

“As the BJP asked these people to strengthen the party in the ZP and TP elections, the people have abided by our request and have made BJP win in the election. We will work to continue the pending developmental work,” he said. 

“We will request Taluk Panchayat members to allow us to govern in those TPs lacking majority. There is no question of introducing operation kamala,” he affirmed. 

He criticised JD(S) leaders for carrying out negative campaigning against the BJP. But the public have given answer in the form of votes. Meanwhile, he assured to draw the attention of the Forest Minister and senior department officers so as to provide compensation to the farmers.
