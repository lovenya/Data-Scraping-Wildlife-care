A 19-year-old woman who went missing last week was found murdered in the Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary here on Monday. Police have arrested her maternal uncle in connection with the case.

Krupa Merline, of Vaddara Doddi near Hanur, left on Friday for Bengaluru where she was a student at St Joseph’s College. But she didn’t reach Bengaluru, prompting her family to file a missing person complaint at the Ramapur police station.

Police arrested Merline’s uncle Perianayagam for the murder. According to police, when Merline left for Bengaluru, Perianayagam took her to MM Hills, saying her mother had asked him to give her money and that he would do so by withdrawing cash from an ATM. He reportedly proposed to her on the way to MM Hills but she turned it down. Perianayagam got angry and killed her by smashing her with a boulder, police said.ADVERTISEMENT
