It is targeted by professional track hunters for its valuable fur.

The cat is endemic to India and Sri Lanka, which means it is found only in these two countries. But so far it has been reported mainly from the Western Ghats, besides some pockets of Jammu and Central India.

“The cat was seen in camera traps during the recent country level estimation of tigers and co-predators. Its presence has also been reported in the western areas of Pilibhit,” said an official.

The rare species was photographed by a research team of the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, on the road on July 28 and August 3, 2011, near the Morghati forest rest house within the reserve. The Rusty spotted cat is a highly endangered cat species, which has been accorded the highest statutory protection under schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, besides appendix-I of the CITES.

Declining numbers
According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, its population is on a decline due to habitat loss. 

There is no sub-population containing more than 1,000 mature breeding individuals. The cat is nocturnal and partly arboreal, spending the day sleeping in dense cover or shelter such as hollow logs. 

It feeds mainly on rodents and birds, but may also eat lizards, frogs, or insects. They hunt primarily on the ground, making rapid, darting movements to catch their prey. 

They climbed trees primarily to escape larger predators rather than for food. As with other cats, they mark their territory by spraying their urine.
