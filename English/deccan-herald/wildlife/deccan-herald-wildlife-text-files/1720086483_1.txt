India is the largest tiger range country in the world. With nearly 30,000 elephants, India is the largest Asiatic elephant range country in the world. India has the world’s largest population of 3,000 single-horn rhinos. India is the only country to have Asiatic lions and their population has increased from 525 in 2015 to 675 in 2020. Leopard population has gone up by 60 per cent in just four years.” The PM said, “For wildlife to thrive, eco-system must thrive. This is happening in India.

Work to clean rivers like Ganga helped bio-diversity and aquatic species considered endangered have improved.”“People, especially tribal communities like Bharia from Central India and Warli from Maharashtra, worship nature and animals. Tiger is the vehicle of Goddess Durga and Lord Ayyappa. India’s relationship with tigers dates back to thousands of years. This is evident from 10,000-year-old rock art of tiger in Maharashtra,” the prime minister said.
