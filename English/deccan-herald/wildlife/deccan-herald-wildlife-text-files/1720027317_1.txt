He said, with increased co-operation between State police and wildlife wardens, the move would prevent any instances of wildlife crimes going undetected. 

The meeting noticed that crimes under the WLP Act have been increasing over the years. Apart from killing tigers, leopards and elephants, poachers are now concentrating on rare species like saw fish, sand-boa and start turtles which are on the verge of extinction. A massive international trade is going on in wildlife. We have to be more alert,” said the DIG.

No proper data

Earlier, the day-long meeting called for better co-operation and co-ordination between officials from the Forest and Police departments and observed that units such as the Forest Cell-CID Karnataka should be replicated in all the States. 

The officers even felt that at present there is no proper gathering of intelligence on crime and criminals and even information gathered is not shared with others.  

“When cases are detected the data on criminals is not disseminated to others. Because of this, crimes are not curbed properly. The meeting felt that we should have a data bank on crimes and criminals under the WLP Act, which should be available to all the law enforcing agencies,” said M C Narayana Gowda, IGP (Forest Cell - CID).

The police officers from neighbouring Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala also suggested during the meeting that capacity-building exercises for all the stakeholders should be increased. “Some officers felt that Forensic Science labs working under the Police Department should also take up Forensic analysis of wildlife crimes. Nowadays, fake animal skins and fake ivory tusks are found in big numbers and there is a need to certify if the seized article is genuine,” said IGP Narayana Gowda.ADVERTISEMENT
