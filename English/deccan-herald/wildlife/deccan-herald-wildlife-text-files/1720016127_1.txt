On reaching Brisbane, the capital of Queensland and the second largest state of Australia, I was mesmerised by the lush green tropical forests, wildlife, sun-kissed beaches and the water sports that the 2,300-km-long Great Barrier Reef offers. Brisbane reminds me of the numerous cricket matches that were played here. We then head northwards to Cairns, home to tropical rain forests and varied fauna. The city is a melting pot.

Enveloping calmness

Later, we hit the road. As I watch palm and gum trees pass by, Bryan, our good-humoured chauffeur, shares trivia about this vibrant city as the limousine speeds up on the road, a small distance from the Pacific Ocean. It is a picturesque coastline and a serpentine way to our next destination. We reach the privately-owned Thala (a local bird) Beach Nature Resort and the ocean is right in front of us. 

The resort has a number of timber lodges that are raised on strong wooden pillars. “Thala offers you a wholesome experience where you can indulge yourself in activities like bird watching, nature walks, visit the sky observatory, treat yourself to culinary demonstrations and scrumptious food,” says the general manager of the resort, Johan Klindt. 

In the evening, we visit Port Douglas, a village now turned into a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. The Sailaway takes us for a one-hour boat ride into the Pacific. As the sun sinks into the ocean, we head back to the resort for dinner and late-night star gazing. As I stand outside my lodge, I am in awe — of the tranquil ocean and the constellations in the sky. I retire for the night with the sound of rainfall and croaking sounds of toads for  company. 

The next morning, we visit the Daintree Rainforest after driving through sugarcane fields. Ricky, our guide, gives us details of the complex eco-system of the Daintree Tropical Park — its poisonous trees, leaves with mercury, hook-bearing, flaring and stinging plants, crocodiles and the unique dragon. “The dragon (a reptile) has been living here for 15 million years. Australia has most of the 840 variety of reptiles and 70 dragon species,” he informs us and adds, “this forest has the most poisonous plants and 180 snake species. It has recorded close to 3,000 snake bites this year!” 
Daintree is the world’s largest rain forest and a paradise for botanists, wildlife and nature lovers. A raised steel and wooden path makes the exploring exercise smooth. Interrupted by streams, rivers and waterfalls, it is nothing short of paradise. We finished exploring the forest and were fortunate enough to taste some fresh ice cream at Tracy’s Farm. “This is the toughest assignment of the day!” quips Ricky, savouring his choicest flavour.

Later, we bid goodbye to the Thala Resort and head to another getaway —  the Palm Cove Sea Temple Resort and Spa. We watch tourists lazing around, soaking up some sun and enter the hotel where we are greeted by a bust of Gautam Buddha, installed near the front gate. The very next day, it is time to be shipped to magical the Great Barrier Reef. 

A pick-up coach drops us at Port Douglas where we board Quicksilver that cruises for nearly two hours on the Pacific to reach the reef. Here, you can either go scuba diving, snorkeling or simply sit in a submarine and watch the vibrant marine life under the reef. The Great Barrier Reef that began to grow 18 million years ago, stretches upto 2,300 km along Australia's north-east coast. In 1981, UNESCO declared it a world heritage site. 

Bustling coastline

The experience of taking a helicopter ride to get an aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef is breathtaking, to say the least, especially for those who are not too keen on diving deep into the sea. “We have two platforms in the ocean. Tourists cruise here in the morning, engage in various adventure sports, watch the marine life and return to the coast before evening,” says Megan Bell, manager with the Quicksilver  Group. 
The shining coastline along Cairns, Brisbane and the Gold Coast is a new thriving business of entertainment, health and hotel tourism. It is replete with hotels, restaurants and bars which provide exotic food coupled with an array of beer and wine. Although finding vegetarian food on the menu is rare, it is always available on request.

The Cairns Tropical Zoo is another must-visit where you can watch beautiful animals up close — koala, kangaroo, American alligators, saltwater crocodiles, cotton-top tamarin monkeys and the cassowary. 

“All these creatures have a large space to move around and the zoo has employed attendants and vets to look after them,” says Barbara Thomson, manager, Wildlife Tropical North Queensland. As we leave for Brisbane, I watch a few tamarin monkeys playing with the purse of one of the attendants of the zoo. 

At a party close to the beautiful Brisbane River, I soak in the sights and sounds of Brisbane while hundreds of guests are immersed in conversations over wine and cheese and the wide-sweep of Queensland’s glistening landscape is still settling down.ADVERTISEMENT
