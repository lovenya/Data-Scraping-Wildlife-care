Organised by the Centre for Media Studies (CMS)—one of the biggest to be held in the City—it screened films from countries like the USA, Norway, New Zealand, Finland, the UK, Iran, Ireland, Germany, Pakistan and Canada, apart from nearly 50 Indian fiction and non-fiction films.

“Though the participation from outside the country is increasing every year, number of directors turning up in the festival is same as last year because they have to come on their own expenses. This year we have around eight foreign directors,” informed Narendra Yadav, senior communication manager, CMS. Local filmmakers, on the other hand feel that the participation of foreign films helps them develop a sense of understanding about what is being done towards environment and wildlife outside the country. 

And it’s a win win situation for international filmmakers too! “With festivals like these, foreign films and directors get a chance to market their films,” said Majeed Gulistan, whose film “The Bird Catcher” competed in the section of films for children.

This year, the five-day festival, which concluded on December 10, incorporated a new element of organising trade shows that demonstrated latest filmmaking technology, special sessions with foreign and Indian experts in the field of environment and wildlife filmmaking and conservation.

During the special sessions, experts like eminent conservationists George Schaller and A J T Johnsingh shared their journey and experiences with Indian directors, while filming the environment and elusive biodiversity around the world.

 “The standard of Indian filmmakers is good but they are yet to grow in terms of garnering more funds and adopting new technologies. So, we tried to create a global platform for them this year by making it more interactive,” said P N Vasanti, director, CMS.

 Evald Otterstad, whose film “Cultural Landscape” was invited for Best of World Natural History and Conservative Cinema section, told Metrolife that Indian documentary filmmakers need to develop their own style of filmmaking rather than imitating the West. 

“Indian directors are very conscious about reaching to the international audience. They are very skilled but should have a new approach,” expressed the Norwegian film director.
Speaking about the festival, Otterstad further stated that it was very successful because of the presence of some very eminent directors and experts from other countries.

The Asian Summit was one more added feature of this year’s festival with both filmmakers and film commissioners interacting and exchanging ideas, and exploring prospects for joint ventures and partnerships.

Next year, the festival will travel to small cities across various countries where award winning films will be screened. “It is not good to organise it every time in Delhi, so next year we will be looking at newer venues,” Vasanti added.
