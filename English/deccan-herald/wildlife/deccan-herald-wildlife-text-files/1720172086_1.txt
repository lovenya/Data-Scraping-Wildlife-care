Akshay Kumar, Chief Naturalist, Bamboo Forest Safari Lodge , Tadoba, has shot the video, when he was taking a guest to the Tourism Zone of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve.

“It’s a best naturalist moment that one can get," an elated Akshay Kumar told Deccan Herald over phone on Friday. “Nothing can be more exciting", he said.

The video was shot on Wednesday.

The female Sloth Bear ear along with a cub might have gone towards the water body when the Tiger  was relaxing. The agitated Tiger pounced on her – and then there was a battle – a clash of the titans. Both the animals were seen charging each other. At one point, it appears that it was end game for the Sloth Bear as it was literally pinned down. But it fights back and chases the beast.

Akshay Kumar said that it appears that the fight as a result of access to a water body. "Matkasur is one of most dominant males in Tadoba", said Kishor Rithe, member, Maharashtra State Board for Wildlife.

"In Tadoba there are 44 tigers and 50 plus Sloth Bears", said Rithe.
