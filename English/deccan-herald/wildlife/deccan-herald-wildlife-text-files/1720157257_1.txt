The High Court on Tuesday allowed women to work as waitresses in bars and restaurants with the condition that they must be aged 21 years and above, and obtain prior approval of a competent authority.

ADVERTISEMENTThe Bench also observed that the new guidelines of the Home Department be adhered to in this regard. The court allowed a petition by Bangalore Ladies’ Working Bars and Restaurant Owners’ Association that sought restraint on police intervention in their lawful business and to accord permission to women to work as professional bartenders.

Justice A S Bopanna directed that a review meeting between the government and the association be held after three months where the practicalities of the guidelines could be discussed.

The guidelines include making available personal details of individual waitresses to the police station concerned within a month of obtaining the licence and certain aspects of dress code.

Relocate jumbos

The High Court has directed the State government to relocate the wild elephant in Sakleshpur, Hassan district, which had raised concerns of public safety. Recently, Lakshme Gowda was trampled by the elephant. The government had submitted a plea before the court to allow it to relocate the animal. Allowing the same, a division bench comprising Chief Justice D H Waghela and Justice B V Nagarathna directed the government to ensure that elephants are not isolated and are part of a herd. Advocates for the government submitted that Sections 11 and 12 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act talk about animals posing danger to human life and their relocation to an alternative suitable habitat.
