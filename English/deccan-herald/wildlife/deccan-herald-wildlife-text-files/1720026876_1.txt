A leopard was injured after it was hit by a speeding vehicle while crossing the road at Jadigadde near Amadahalli, off National Highway-17, in the taluk.

The leopard suffered wounds on the face and severe injuries in the groin. The big cat was not able to move from the road for about 20 minutes due to injuries. 

As a crowd started gathering at the spot, it moved into a nearby grove, abutting a rail line. 

Forest officials, who visited the spot, made a vain effort to trace the animal. They claimed that they had no proper equipment to capture the leopard. Officials from the Dandeli Wildlife division, who have been informed about the incident, will arrive here, capture the leopard and provide medical aid to it, Range Forest Officer Manjunath told Deccan Herald.

A six-month-old female leopard died after being reportedly run over by an estate vehicle near Honnemaragudi in the Punajanur range of the Biligiriranganathaswamy (BRT) Tiger Reserve in the district, reports DHNS from Chamarajangar.

Beat forest personnel found the leopard’s carcass on the roadside in the morning and informed the senior officials. 

The killer vehicle is said to belong to one of the four private estates at Bedaguli in the tiger reserve. ADVERTISEMENT“It is possible that the leopard was killed by a vehicle. The autopsy has been conducted and investigation is on,” Anupama, Assistant Conservator of Forests of Project Tiger, at the Tiger Reserve, told Deccan Herald.
