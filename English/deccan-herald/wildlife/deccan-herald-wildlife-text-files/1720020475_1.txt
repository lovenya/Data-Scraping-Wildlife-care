Chidambaram, Nayar and Kumble lit the traditional lamp to mark the occasion got up at a hotel last night.

Speaking on the occasion, eminent journalist Kuldip Nayar said Deccan Herald had always stood for fair and objective journalism.

"In a democracy, societies needs free information and that is our purpose. Our inspiration comes from Independence movement which showed us the way on how to be a secular, democratic polity," Nayar, who is associated with the newspaper group as a Director, said referring to the role of media.

Nayar also noted there was a debate about whether there should be some kind of regulation of the press or whether self-regulation was the best regulation for media.

"Press should not never be directly or indirectly controlled. It will be a sad day if it ever comes to that and papers will resist it. It is only the self regulation, may be it is not as good as it should be, I confess that," Nayar said, adding that papers including Deccan Herald would protect their freedom.

Krishna said that despite competition Deccan Herald had "managed to hold sway over readers not just in Karnataka but also in the rest of the country" and congratulated the paper for "having achieved another milestone."

Union Minister for Labour and Employment Mallikarjun Kharge expressed happiness that the paper was bringing out an edition in the Natiaonal Capital.

Kumble said that Deccan Herald was a paper which stood out for objectivity and added that he appreciated its wildlife coverage.ADVERTISEMENT
