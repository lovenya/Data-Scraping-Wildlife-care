Rare fish seized, 1 held

A youth was arrested for possessing a portion of a rare fish, with high medicinal value, in Bangalore South on Thursday.

The Girinagar police said, Chandan (23), a native of Yelandur village in Chamarajanagar was arrested on charges of violating the Wildlife Act norms. 

He was picked up in front of a bar while he was waiting for customers. A portion of the saw fish worth around Rs 5 lakh in the international market was confiscated from him.
He is yet to reveal from where he got the fish, but certainly he had some contacts in the coastal areas since the fish is found only in the sea, added the police.
