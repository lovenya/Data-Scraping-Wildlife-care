"I decided to produce the film because I truly believe tigers are one of the most magnificent creatures on this planet. And if we don't take quick and immediate action to preserve them there will be no tigers left," John said.
Through the film, which will be screened in the documentary section of film festivals and at wildlife-preservation summits, John and Pandey hope to create a certain amount of global awareness about the urgent need to preserve the tiger.
"This film is far too important in terms of its message. I decided to produce it after I met Mike Pandey. He's such a lovely man, so committed to capturing the essence of nature on camera. I justÂ  decided to get committed to Mike's level of commitment," said John who wowed everyone with his performance in "New York".ADVERTISEMENT
