This is Harini, the lonely doe on the HD Kote - Manandavadi Road, outside the Rajiv Gandhi National Park in the Balle Forest Range.

Ignoring the signboard which warns the visitors, ‘Do not feed wild animals,’ one cannot resist the temptation to feed Harini. Harini is a foodie and loves munching on any snack offered by the visitors. She has no reservations on being fed by strangers nor is she bothered about being attacked by a tusker. She enjoys snacking on the items fed by the tourists. 

According to the Forest officials, Harini was separated from the herd when she was young. 

She was sheltered in the backyard of the Forest department office and was raised under the vigilant eyes of the forest officials.

Separated from herd

Range Forest Officer Satish told Deccan Herald that once a deer is separated from the herd, it cannot mingle with another herd. “Each herds is like a different deer family. Other families will not take a stray deer into their fold,” he added. Though Harini appears healthier than her counterparts in the wild, the Forest officials are of the opinion that it is not advisable for the visitors to feed Harini. She might get accustomed to being fed by strangers.

Wildlife enthusiast Nithin Ranga says it is very difficult for deer to survive, once she is separated from its family. The very fact that Harini has survived for nearly seven years, is something rare. The Forest officials should ask people not to feed animals. By doing so, the animals become domesticated and turn into easy prey for poachers.
