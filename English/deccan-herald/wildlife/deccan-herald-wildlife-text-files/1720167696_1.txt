Sidda, the injured wild elephant, was successfully shifted into the improvised enclosure constructed by the Madras Engineer Group (MEG) at the Manchanabele dam, Magadi taluk, Ramanagaram district, in the wee hours of Thursday. 

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to Dr Arun A Sha, the vet from Wildlife SOS, although Sidda’s body is balanced through harness, only three of his legs are on the ground as he is unable to keep his injured right fore leg on the ground. 

He said, Sidda seemed quite cheerful in the morning, throwing soil and grass on to his body. 

“It is quite a discomfort for Sidda, but after lying on the ground for over 18 days, it was good to see him on his feet. Watching him throw soil and water on to his body is bringing cheer to the team treating him,” Dr Sha said.

He said, although Sidda is doing just okay, he has lost a lot of weight, which is a major concern. 

The doctor said that he was constantly in touch with the senior vets from the Forest department and was monitoring the jumbo’s condition. 
Dr Sha said that he was thankful to the MEG for planning and executing the construction of the enclosure and also helping them in shifting the animal into the enclosure.    
  
He had fallen into a trench and injured himself at Kollur village on August 29 while He was walking and was driven by the forest guards. 

After walking for 15 km, he entered the backwaters of the Manchanabele dam, where he has remained for over 60 days now.
