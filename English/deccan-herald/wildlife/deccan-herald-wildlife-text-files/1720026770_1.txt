My father was also a great hunter,” says Hambir. During 1970 and 80s, there were many mining companies in this area,  destroying most of the forest and wildlife of Joida taluk. 

Come to Joida, one of the most backward taluks of Karnataka, with 80 per cent of forest cover. Out of 120 villages, many lack basic development. Man-animal conflict is a everyday scene here. The forest resources of Joida comes under the jurisdiction of Dandeli (wildlife), Haliyal and Karwar divisions. Derekar family of Daria was famous till the last decade when it was the biggest tribal joint family of the district. Hambir Derekar has toured most of the taluk during his employment in mines during the 70s and 80s. Today, though, his sons are working towards restoring forest cover in the region. 
Meanwhile, the forest department’s street play awareness programmes for the conservation of wildlife has evoked good response. Many tribal villagers now understand the need for the conservation of wildlife. 

The awareness programme undertaken by the Dandeli-Anshi wildlife division through the Sahyadri Parisara Sangha has made villagers  think of the what, how and why of wildlife conservation. Narasimha Chapkhanda who leads a group of artistes also works for Wildlife Conservation Society. Thanks to the then DFO of Dandeli wildlife Manoj Kumar, who understood the impact of street plays, such awareness programmes have become regular affairs. 

Many tourists visit the Dandeli wildlife sanctuary every year. It is important that they all join hands for conservation of wildlife. 
It is important to understand the forest communities and their needs. They have to be given responsibilities for conserving wildlife. 
Anti-poaching camps have been set up by the Forest Department in the border areas where hunting was rampant. It is vital for locals to extend their co-operation to the department to check poaching.
