Christmas and New Year’s Eve are just around the corner. While there isn’t much time to plan an elaborate vacation, you can surely get that last-minute break. ADVERTISEMENTTravel agencies say, domestic travel is on the rise this holiday season. Places like Gujarat, Kerala and Shimla are the top picks.“The demand for short-break packages to South India, particularly Kerala, is on a high,” says Rajiv Naidu, general manager, sales, SOTC Travel. International destinations such as Bhutan, Bali, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and The Maldives are popular choices. With Dubai Shopping Festival starting on December 26, travel enthusiasts are excited about it too. “Short-break packages don’t have a visa challenge. One can plan a trip in 2-3 days and fly off. In places like Bali, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, Indians have visa on arrival, whereas in Sri Lanka, one can register for prior visa approval 24 hours before arrival,” says Rajiv.Though the demand for domestic destinations was low last year, this year end, many are opting for pilgrimage sites like Shirdi, Rameswaram, Madurai, Kanyakumari, Navgraha and Panch Mahabhootam temples.“The travel package ranges between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000. It is inclusive of ‘darshan’ assistance, accommodation and transportation, along with priests speaking the local language in most temples,” he adds.

Thus, queries for places like Nandi Hills, Puducherry, Hampi, Mysuru, Kabini, Goa and Kodagu abound.   Prashant Pitti, executive director, EaseMyTrip, says Puducherry witnesses extravagant Christmas celebrations every year because of its pleasant weather. The other destinations mentioned above are an ideal weekend getaway.“Looking at the bookings we have received, we have noticed Bengalureans prefer to travel within a 500 km radius of the city to enjoy Christmas and
New Year’s eve. They don’t want to spend a lot of time and money on just travelling,” he says. 
“Also, locally-owned homestays have become popular in recent times because travellers have become environmentally responsible. They are supporting local communities,” adds Prashant. According to data by Thomas Cook India, there is also a 20 per cent increase in demand for solo travel among Bengaluru’s new-age travellers. “They have become confident
explorers and are experimental with their holidays,” says Rajeev Kale, president and country head – Holidays, MICE, Visa, Thomas Cook India Ltd.He adds that with an increasing disposable income and a desire for an immersive experiential holiday, solo travellers prefer personalisation and are usually on the lookout for a voyage of self-discovery.“Unconventional destinations like Spiti, Cherrapunji, Hampi, Gokarna, Bir, Khajuraho, Varkala and Gujarat are gaining popularity this year. Millennials are also opting for unique accommodations like a tree house in Malaysia or a luxury tent in Rajasthan,” he notes.
