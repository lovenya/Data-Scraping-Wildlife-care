The death of 26-year old male elephant Naganna at Sakrebailu elephant camp recently has raised concerns about healthcare facilities available in the camp, 14 km from Shivamogga city.ADVERTISEMENTSources in the camp said the absence of a basic veterinary clinic in the camp has turned out to be a major hurdle for veterinarians to provide timely and quality healthcare to the tuskers. With the death of Naganna, the number of elephants has come down to 24.Sources in Forest Department (Wildlife), Shivamogga Division, said nine elephants died in the camp in just two years.Among them, two died of age-related problems and the remaining died of health issues, infighting, etc. The death of three baby elephants, including Bharathi and Balaji, has become a matter of concern.

The situation is more or less same in other elephant camps in the state,” he added.The Karnataka High Court had asked the state to file an affidavit regarding the number of elephant camps run by the state and facilities there.A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice H T Narendra Prasad issued this direction after hearing a Public Interest Litigation filed by city-based advocate N P Amrutesh. The court demanded that the affidavit be filed within four weeks.The court also asked the government advocate to provide information on the availability of veterinarians in elephant camps.
