Worse, the quarrying locations are close to the Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Tiger (BRT) Reserve Forest and the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. 

A Supreme Court order has laid it down that permission cannot be granted for any non-forest activities within a 10-km radius of tiger reserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries. There is a total ban on granite quarrying in such areas.

The State government had instructed the district administration to conduct spot inspection of the mining areas and collect the losses from the mine owners. 
Accordingly, the investigation is being conducted out by the tahsildars of the two taluks, the geologists of the mines and geology department, the revenue inspectors and the land surveyors.

‘Babus hand in glove’

The report of the probe team to the district administration, a copy of which is available with Deccan Herald, says that officials are hand in glove with miners in causing losses to the exchequer. 

A loss of Rs 894.53 crore has been established at survey number 184 of Jyothigowdanapura in Chamarajanagar taluk alone. This quarrying area is very close to the BRT Reserve Forest.ADVERTISEMENTAs many as 124 ‘khata’ holders of this survey number have been issued notices. 
Of these only 40 have stated that quarrying is not taking place in the land allotted to them. Others have not replied. Since the replies have not come about even after the last date, the district administration is planning to initiate action against the guilty. 

Losses to the tune of Rs 792 crore have been caused to the exchequer due to quarrying in and around Ponnachi and Changadi villages of Kollegal taluk. 

These villages are very near to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. As officials seldom visit these areas, it is easy to transport the black stone quarried illegally to Tamil Nadu via Palar. 

The report clearly mentions that illegal quarrying has taken place on government land in the villages.

It details the illegal quarrying in the various survey numbers of the two villages, and the resultant losses to the State exchequer.
