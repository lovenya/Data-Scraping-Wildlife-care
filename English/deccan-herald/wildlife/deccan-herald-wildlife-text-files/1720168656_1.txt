Vehicles found crossing the 40-km speed limit along the boundaries of Kaziranga National Park will now have to pay an environment compensation of Rs 5,000. The violation would attract an additional penalty under the Motor Vehicles Act , the National Green Tribunal said on Wednesday. The National Highway-37 passes along the southern boundaries of the national park.
Concerned over wildlife deaths in road accidents near the home of the famous one-horned rhinos, a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar directed the Assam government to erect speed breakers on this 66-km-long stretch within two weeks.

The green panel passed the order after the director of the park, who was present before it, conveyed that four animals were killed by speeding vehicles since January this year despite installation of sensor-operated automated traffic barriers to prevent such accidents.

“Why have these animals died despite installation of the barriers. You should take effective measures to stop these animal casualties,” the bench told the authorities concerned. “Every vehicle which is challaned for over-speeding will have to pay an environment compensation of Rs 5,000 per accident over and above the challan as prescribed under the MV Act,” it said.

The NGT also directed the state government to take effective measures to contain animal deaths and said it should strictly monitor the speed limit prescribed for vehicles passing through the stretch. During the hearing, the national park director told the bench that sensor-operated automatic barriers on NH-37 near Malini Camp of the rhino habitat have been installed.
He submitted that a total of four animals — two hog deer, one capped langur and one python — have died till April 30 after being hit by vehicles. Three interceptor vehicles are at present in operation round-the-clock on the 66-km stretch of the highway running along the park to check vehicle speed does not exceed the 40-km limit, he added.
