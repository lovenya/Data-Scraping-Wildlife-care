The awards were ‘Foot Soldier Award’, ‘Best Range Forest Officer Award’, ‘Outstanding Civil Servant Award’, ‘Wildlife Leadership Award’, ‘Exceptional Applied Conservationist Award’ and ‘Jumbo Award’. 

The event was presided over by Forest Minister C P Yogeshwara, Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, A K Varma, head of forest force; B K  Singh, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife); and Anil Kumble. 

About the difficulties an officer has to face while working in forest, B K Singh said, “Taking care of forests and wildlife is indeed a big task. But our officers have done an excellent job during the forest fires in Bandipur and Nagarhole, this year.”

Mentioning that awards and rewards are essential in one’s life, A K Varma said, “It is a matter of pride not only for the awardees but also for the entire forest department. Such awards boosts our confidence.”

The ‘Foot Soldier Award’ were given to C Sadashivam, Chandrakant R Naik and H H Venkatesh. 

The ‘Outstanding Civil Servant Award’ went to Bishwajit Mishra, the ‘Best Range Forest Officer’ was awarded to Sangamesh N Prabhakar whereas Aranya Wildlife Trust was given the ‘Wildlife Leadership Award’. 

Also, the ‘Exceptional Applied Conservational Scientist’ was awarded to Madhusudan and the ‘Jumbo Award’ was given to Krupakar B S and K Senani. Both, Krupapkar and Senani are wildlife photographers and film-makers, who also have been the recipients of ‘Green Oscars’ for their film on the Indian wild dog.

But the most awaited award, ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’, was given to Ullas Karanth.  He is notable for pioneering the scientific use of camera traps in population density studies with large wild mammals in the country.

The award ceremony became more colourful when team Royal Challengers Bangalore made a quick and short appearance. Also present at the award function was Virender Sehwag and former Indian wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.
