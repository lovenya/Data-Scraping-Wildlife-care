The road that passes through Kudremukh National Park is fast turning out to be a threat for wild animals. 

After poaching, poisoning of animals by the villagers, the animals now face a threat from vehicles on the highway that passes through Kudremukh national park, said Wildlife Board former member S Girijashankar, and environmentalist M N Shadakshari. 

In a press release, they said Kudremukh wildlife division should have protected the animals. However, the highway has been turned into a death zone. 

The road has been developed recently and motorists drive in a reckless manner, ignoring any plea to pay heed to wild animals that cross the highway. 

The wildlife division has failed to direct the PWD to install speed-breakers on the road. 

Kalasa-Karkala, Kalasa-Sringeri road passes through the National Park.ADVERTISEMENT The road was developed recently. While giving permission for the development of the road, the Deputy Conservator of Forest should have limited the speed on the road to 20 km by constructing speed breakers, they said. “We are not against development of Kalasa-Karkala, Kalasa-Sringeri road. However, the authorities should have instructed the PWD to lay speed breakers.” 

Owing to the reckless driving, endangered species like ‘Singalika,’ ‘Barka,’ and Sambar deers have been killed. 

The wildlife division is aware of the killing of the animals.

However, it is a tragedy that the officials have not taken any measures for the safety of the animals.
