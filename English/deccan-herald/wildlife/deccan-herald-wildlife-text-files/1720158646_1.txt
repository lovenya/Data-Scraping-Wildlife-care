The city government’s Forest and Wildlife Department is now planning to hire monkey catchers from the neighbouring states to tackle the problem of simians in the national capital. 

ADVERTISEMENT“Although it is the responsibility of civic agencies to arrange monkey catchers for trapping monkeys from the inhabited areas of the city, we have written to our counterparts in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh requesting them to send details of monkey catchers who are willing to work in Delhi,” Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife Warden A K Shukla told Deccan Herald.

The High Court had ordered civic bodies to catch monkeys, while the Delhi government will rehabilitate them in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary on the southern periphery of the city. And, the wildlife department is required to provide the knowhow and cages.

The municipal corporations are grappling with the shortage of monkey catchers in the city. 

The East Delhi Municipal Corporation does not have even a single monkey catcher whereas the North Corporation has three of them. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation has 30 catchers, while the New Delhi Municipal Council has around 40.

Experts said the monkeys who are sent to the sanctuary, often run away from the premises.According to the Forest and Wildlife Department, “The Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary has six feet high boundary walls and on its top there is a three-feet barred wire fencing. Only a few stray incidences have been reported when monkeys ran out of the sanctuary.”
