With modernising being the trend, traditional houses are fast disappearing in Bangalore. But nostalgia for old, spacious and cool traditional homes still lingers in the hearts of many. Maya Girish visits an old house in south Bangalore.

The white and brown house with a Madras roof which sits elegantly at the centre takes us back by a century. Close your eyes and you can see the doors of the house wide open with numerous visitors including neighbours, varada hudugaru (young students who came to the house for lunch), bangle sellers, etc jostling past. 

The Narain house hasn’t seen any drastic changes in approximately 90 years, except for a change in the flooring, cement walls and the removal of one attic. The wide doors, small double door windows and old style roofing are in tip top condition. 
Everything is nostalgia inducing, including the walls which are painted with white on the upper half and a colour on the lower half, the Mangalore-style porch roof and the small steep and narrow staircases.

Rukma Narain has kept the house clean and pristine, making sure to maintain it every three years. Her grandfather, Rao Sahib Ramarao began the construction of the house in 1920s. The house has fifteen rooms and the plot measures 24,400 sqft. 

A few features of the house caught my attention when I visited. The house has three living rooms. One is right at the entrance of the house for quick visits. One is a large spacious central hall which leads to all the other rooms of the house. 

A divan/mancha (cot) is placed against each of its four walls and four red pillars rise up around the centre of the hall where a wooden-plank swing hangs from a higher ceiling. The room is airy and well lit; it’s where the family gatherings take place. It is tastefully done up with a few beautiful brass lamp stands, chimes, more hanging brass lamps and bells, simple cotton spreads and such like. The small portion of the ceiling from where the swing hangs is at a higher level with small windows which make optimal use of the sun’s rays to light up the room.

Beads tell a tale

But the other living room is just as interesting. It’s one of the prettiest rooms in the house and you can see how it has been improved over many generations of the family. In olden times, a glass bead torana (adornment) used to hang in the doorway and was usually made by the women of the house. The glass beads in the curtains here are more than a hundred years old and were first made by Rukma’s great grandmother; Rukma and her grandchildren spent many fun-filled evenings remaking these curtains for their beaded living room, thus continuing the tradition that began many years ago.

“We did not renovate much at all. Everything is the same as when I was a girl. Everything here has been handed down through the generations!” Rukma beams proudly. “Even the glass beads were my great grandmother’s and we remade them together as a family. Everyone helped!”

Another unique aspect is the master bedroom on the first floor. Above the bedroom used to be an attic, but since most of the family members had some sort of dust allergy, the attic had to go. When it was removed, the bedroom’s ceiling gained new height, which allowed for pretty hanging decorations in the interior, with the former attic windows showering the room with light. 

Being a devout family, there are two styles of puja rooms and little stands for the deities in the house. The layouts of these rooms are very different. 

The puja room attached to Rukma’s brother Krishnamurthy’s room is a veritable museum of sorts. He has a large collection of idols in brass, wood, silver, etc as well as a few beautiful pictures. 

The other puja room is completely opposite to this one in that it is sparse. It has a little platform from which the main deity presides over the house, with brass lamps and flowers adding some beauty to it.

Full of memorabilia

The interiors are a mixture of antiques and wildlife memorabilia. Rao Sahib Ramarao was a wildlife warden and this legacy was passed on from generation to generation. 
The living room at the entrance has a bison skull hanging near the ceiling. Wildlife photographs also dot random hallways, making it a really intriguing house to explore fully.

The exterior of the house is no less beautiful. Krishnamurthy teaches dance and decided to convert the backyard into a dance school with a stage for performances and concerts. The design is a beautiful mix of contemporary and modern. There spacious semi-open-air hall with a large stage at the end and artwork of all kinds graces the walls. On the left of the stage are little idols under tiny roofs watching over the students. 

A jackfruit tree branches out with a tiny platform on which rests a beautiful Ganesha statue. More idols guard the corridors giving it a temple-like feel. Gardens surround the house. 

The Narain’s house is idyllic. Though it’s right on the main road, the design and the large spaces keep it far removed from the outside word. The memories and laughter that filled the house for generations make it the perfect home.
