The Union government has suggested to the Supreme Court to allow movement of transport vehicles 24x7 on the national highway passing through Bandipur Tiger Reserve but only after developing five elevated roads of one kilometre each.ADVERTISEMENT“The metalled road under the elevated sections would be milled and converted into a forest landscape to maintain continuity of the forest with ease of movement of wildlife without any barriers,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said.A stretch of 34.60 km of National Highway 212 passes through Bandipur and Wayanad national parks. At present, traffic on the stretch is banned from 9 pm to 6 am.Tamil Nadu had no issue with the ban. Karnataka stuck to its stand on restriction on traffic, since an alternative route via Mysuru-Hunsur-Gonnikoppal-Kutta, was being used by commuters for the last nine years. Kerala, however, wanted the lifting of the ban, citing hardships.Due to lack of consensus, the Union government sought directions from the top court for constructing elevated roads at an estimated cost of Rs 450 to Rs 500 crore with the ministry agreeing to bear 50% cost and Kerala the remaining 50%.The Union government said the wildlife department and the forest department of Karnataka and Kerala would decide on the location of the elevated section.
