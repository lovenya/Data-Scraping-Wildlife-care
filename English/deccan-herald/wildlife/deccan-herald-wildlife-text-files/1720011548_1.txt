Speaking to reporters in Bangalore, he said he has advised the Government against lifting the ban under any pressure.

In fact, Chief Minister Yeddyurappa had lifted the ban imposed by Chamarajnagar Deputy Commissioner early last year. Both elected representatives from the State and neighbouring Kerala and transporters from Karnataka had opposed the ban and had met the Chief Minister in this regard. However, the Karnataka High Court restored the ban to protect wildlife.

According to official sources, Kerala leaders have been requesting the CM to get a stay on the High Court order.

‘No mining in Ghats’

Ashisar informed that the Government has assured that mining will not be allowed in the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats.

“No mining lease has been sanctioned in the Ghats’ limits in the last one year and will not be done in future also,” he stated.

A team of experts had visited Ambaragudda area in Kodachadri in December. The team had opined that the area should be declared as an ecological hot spot and mining and other activities should be banned, he said.

Scientists’ conference

The Task Force along with the Forest department is organising a “Scientists’ Conference on Conservation of Western Ghats in Karnataka” on January 28 and 29 at Aranya Bhavan, Bangalore.

The two-day conference will help bring the scientific community and the Government together and bridge the gap between intentions and actions. Eminent scientists will present papers at the conference, while Chief Minister Yeddyurappa will inaugurate it, he said. 

Ashisar added that the Task Force along with IISc scientists, have recommended the Government to chalk out an action plan on climate change.ADVERTISEMENT
