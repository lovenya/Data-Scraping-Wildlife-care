The officials are planning to release the cubs into forest as they have grown up and can live on their own.

Lingaraja said in the first stage, the cubs will be released to a fenced enclosure of about one acre inside the Deverakatte forest in Bhadravati Forest Zone so that they can learn the techniques of hunting and defending themselves against enemies. 

Usually leopard cubs learn hunting and other techniques form its mothers in the first two years. Since hunters had killed mothers of cubs they are now forced to learn all the techniques on their own. As grown male leopard do not like to live together they have to be release into separate areas. The Forest Department is carrying out the release of leopards into the forest for the first time in the State, he added.
