Knowing that it is in a remote part of the country, I was mentally prepared to live in tents, braving the cold winds and low oxygen levels at that altitude.

After two months of preparation, I set out on my journey to Kibber — our base-camp village which gets the credit of being the highest motorable village in the world, at 4200 mts above sea level (or so says Google). 

I was instructed to carry as little luggage as possible with sweater, raincoats, woollen socks and gloves being essentials. From Bangalore, I travelled to Delhi, where our entire group had decided to meet. We reached Shimla after travelling all night from Delhi. And after a brief break, we piled into an SUV to continue our journey to Kaza. Our journey was delayed due to a landslide. 

After spending the night in a small village called Spillow, we proceeded to Nako, which has a small but serene pond with willow trees around it, and then to Tabo, which is famous for its thousand-year-old monastery. On the way is a village called Sumdo, where visitors are allowed only once during the entire year — for the annual fair. The village is said to  offer a good view of the Indo-Tibetan border and hence has a small military camp.

We reached Kaza in the evening and were advised to stay for a day or two and acclimatise to the altitude. On reaching Kibber, I was happy to see solid structures made of mud. To my relief, our base camp too was one such structure! 

The best way to survive in a place is to be like the locals. That meant tweaking a few rules of personal hygiene like rationing one’s baths! Being a hardcore vegetarian, I refused to eat any of the meat delicacies and happily survived on rice, roti and dal.

All creatures great & small
Going out on field work gave me the opportunity to observe a variety of wildlife — from creepy-crawly reptiles to mammals. The Himalayas are home to a variety of bird species. The three biggies are the golden eagle, the Himalayan griffon and the lammergeiers. 

The latter two are scavengers. Lammergeiers scavenge bone marrow by dropping bones on rocks to break them.  There are other colourful birds like the grandala, the rose finch, the Tibetan snow-finch and the common black redstart. 

On certain occasions we also encountered herds of blue sheep and ibex and also certain shy creatures like the pikas (a species similar to both rats and hares) and woolly hares. The red fox can be spotted in fields or near houses. One of the village heads told us that it chews up tender pea pods, causing a huge loss to farmers.

A few of us were lucky to get a glimpse of two Tibetan wolves that had just feasted on their kill. Although Spiti is known to have snow leopard density, the magnificent creature is hardly seen in the open. One often hears news about its hunting spoils.

I was lucky to visit quite a few places like Lossar, which is a connecting village between Lahaul and Spiti; Pin valley, which is famous for its Mud (pronounced ‘moodh’) valley; and Kungri monastery, which attracts a lot of tourists. 

I got to visit some remote parts of Pin valley too. The other famous monasteries of Spiti are in Dunkar and Kee, each having its own illustrious history. The people of Spiti are warm, wonderful and willing to help. Not knowing Spitian, the local language, was never a handicap as the locals went out of their way to converse with us in Hindi and English. 

They taught us a few words in Spitian like ‘Julley’ which means a lot of things including ‘hello’ and ‘bye’, and ‘Zangsho’ which means ‘thank you’.  A few of them enthusiastically taught us their traditional dance and made us listen to Spitian folk songs. On the whole it was a great experience for me. I was really sad to say ‘Julley’ to Spiti and the mighty and beautiful Himalayas.ADVERTISEMENT
