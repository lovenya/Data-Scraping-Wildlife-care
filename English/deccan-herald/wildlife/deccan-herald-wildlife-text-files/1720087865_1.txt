Chief Conservator of Forest and TATR Field Director Dr Jitendra Ramgaokar has launched a foot-patrol and combing operations in search of Maya. “On November 18 2023, the combing teams located the remains of a tiger in compartment number 82 of Tadoba beat of Tadoba range. The remains consisted of skeleton of the tiger and was scattered in the area of about 100 meters radius. All the remains were carefully gathered together, and samples were collected for DNA analysis by the wildlife veterinarian and biologist for further analysis. According to the wildlife veterinarian the remains were in a very advanced stage of decomposition and not fit for further postmortem examination. Also, the tiger has apparently died due to natural causes considering the location of the remains and absence of any human activity in the area,” the MFD said.The samples were sent for DNA analysis to the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru.The reports of the same are expected to arrive by November 30.As part of the search, the entire area of Tadoba and Kolara ranges , known to be her territory and movement area, was covered during this exercise.

However, T 12 was not captured in the area giving rise to the possibility of her absence in the area.As a last resort, an intensive foot patrolling cum combing operation was carried out from 16-18 November, with the help of all the frontline staff of the TATR core area, which found the remains.
