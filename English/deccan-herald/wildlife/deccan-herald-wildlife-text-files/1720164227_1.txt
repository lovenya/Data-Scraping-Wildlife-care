Following the death of a cowherd at Hadanuru village, who was partly devoured by a tiger on Tuesday, the Forest department has launched ‘Operation Tiger’ to trap the wild cat.

ADVERTISEMENTThe tiger had killed Shivanna (55) at Hadanuru abutting the Hediyala forest area in H D Kote taluk in Mysuru district. It was the second such attack in the past one month. Following this, the department has placed a cage at the spot, where the mortal remains of Shivanna were found, with a goat as bait.

More than 25 forest personnel and two sharpshooters, specially deployed from Bengaluru, took part in the operation on Wednesday, that yielded no results. Veterinarians Dr Nagaraj and Dr Shashank are also camping at the spot. Apart from men and materials, three elephants - Ganesh, Parthasarathy and Rohit - from the Rampura elephant camp,  Bandipur National Park, are also pressed into service. An estimated three kilometre area from the spot where Shivanna’s body was found was also combed during the day.

Sharpshooter Sushil Kumar, who made a spot inspection, said that the pug marks indicated that the animal might be a male tiger. Moreover, as it is the mating season for tigers, the animals do not stay at one place and keep moving. An additional eight cameras are being installed at various points in the forest to monitor the movements of the elusive tiger, he added.

The officials have warned the villagers not to venture out of their houses at night. They have also been directed not to take livestock into the forest for grazing. The forest officials are being assisted by police personnel in the operation. Forest officials of Hediyala wildlife zone are camping in the area. The operation will resume on Thursday.
