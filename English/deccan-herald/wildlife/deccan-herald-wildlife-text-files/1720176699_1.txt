Sworn enemies Iran and the United States still hold a number of each other's nationals behind bars, despite the apparent release of an Iranian academic from a US prison overnight.ADVERTISEMENTIn an Instagram post on Tuesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said a plane carrying scientist Sirous Asgari had left America.In spite of soaring tensions, Tehran and Washington have carried out prisoner swaps on at least two occasions in recent years.Among those released were Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, exchanged in 2016 for seven Iranians held in the US, and Massoud Soleimani, an Iranian scientist swapped for US academic Xiyue Wang in December.But it remains unclear if the fate of Asgari is linked to any Americans held in the Islamic republic.With the recent call by Iran for a full prisoner exchange, here is a recap of prisoners currently known to be held by both sides:- US Navy veteran Michael R.
