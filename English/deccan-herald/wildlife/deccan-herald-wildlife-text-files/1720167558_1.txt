Senior BJP leader Jagadish Shettar on Wednesday said the state government is trying to help private companies by reversing its decision to declare Kappatagudda forest in Gadag district as a conservation reserve. 

ADVERTISEMENTShettar, who is leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, said the government had issued a notification in 2015 by declaring parts of Kappatagudda as conservation reserve going by the ecological aspects. However, on November 4, 2016, the notification was withdrawn to help mining company Baldota group and Encorn power generating company. 

He said Ramgad Minerals of Baldota group intends to take up mining activities including gold deposit exploration. The company has submitted an application to the government in this regard. While withdrawing the notification, the government should have sought the Supreme Court’s permission. But this process has not been followed, he charged. 

Shettar said that as many as 20 seers of various mutts recently met Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and submitted a memorandum, urging him not to allow mining activities in the forest area. 

“Siddaramaiah had told the delegation that on the recommendation of the Wildlife Board, the notification was withdrawn. The chief minister himself is on the board. How can he give such answer? We demand the government to reconsider its decision,” he added. 
He also said Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H K Patil, who is from Gadag, is not opposing the move to allow mining. Kappatagudda spreads over taluks of Ron, Gadag and Mundargi. 

Shettar said the Congress party functions are being organised by misusing funds of boards/corporations. Recently, one such programme was held in Gokak by using Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd’s funds, he charged.
