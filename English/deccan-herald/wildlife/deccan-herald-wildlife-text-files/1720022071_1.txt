It was Air Marshal K C Cariappa (Retired) who approached the Supreme Court  to prevent laying a road in Kadamakkal forests in 2008. Accordingly, the Supreme Court had constituted CEC to look into the issue. The CEC submitted its report  to the Supreme Court in the month of February. The CEC report had recommended to take over baane land and forest land grown in private land. 

Forum constituted

To fight against the CEC report, Kodagu Janapara Horata Vedike was also constituted on the occasion. The meeting decided to raise donations from the public to bear the expenses to fight against the CEC report legally. 

The Vedike will create awareness against the CEC report and also appraise the Supreme Court on the need for Kadamakkal road inside the forest. 

The forum will be apolitical and members will include people from all walks of life. The fee to be paid for the lawyer will be collected from the public. A separate finance committee was also constituted on the occasion. 

The meeting decided to submit three appeals against the CEC report in the Supreme Court.

The first appeal would be by the tribals who reside in and around Kadamakkal to appraise Supreme Court on the need for a road. The second appeal would deal with the right to live in rural areas with all the basic facilities. As road is one of the basic facilities, coming in the way of laying a road would amount to coming in the way of right to live. The growers would also question the CEC report and its recommendations on Baane land. Making a reference to the CEC report which had stated that all circulars issued by the State Government with regard to felling timber in Kodagu should be withdrawn and areas with characteristics of forest should be called “ deemed forests.” 

Addressing the gathering, Assembly Speaker K G Bopaiah said that there is a need to argue on the need for baane land in Kodagu. 

Senior advocate A K Subbaiah said “the MLA had taken up the work on Kadamakkal road based on the demands of the people. It is the duty of the MLA to respond to the needs of the people. There is nothing wrong in the move of the MLA. The people of the district should support the elected representatives.”
