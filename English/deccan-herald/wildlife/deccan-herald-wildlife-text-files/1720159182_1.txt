Wildlife Board former member S Girijashankar and environmentalist M N Shadakshari have welcomed the move of the Kudremukh National Park officials to prohibit entry to Hanuman Gundi waterfalls situated in Kudremukh.
 
ADVERTISEMENTIn fact, it was one of the sought after places by the tourists. The rocks in the waterfalls vicinity act as a leisure place for all those rest seekers who wish to spend their time in peace and tranquility listening to the  sound of the waterfalls. Hanuman Gundi waterfalls is situated amidst green cover. The waterfalls originates from Thunga river. However, the visitors who visit the region for enjoying the beauty of nature have been engaged in throwing plastics all over. Inspite of caution board, many enter into water. As a result, the waterbody is being polluted, they said. 

At the same time, the dry grass and plants during summer in and around the waterfalls are likely to catch fire even by a cigarette bud. Many tourists in an inebriated condition have assaulted forest officials in the past as well as in the recent past. Hence, the prohibition to enter the waterfalls is a necessity, said environmentalists.

They said “more than conserving forest, the attempt was initiated to conserve water body in the interest of the sensitivity of the region. The Kudremukh National Park officials should ensure that the prohibition is not temporary. They should not bow for any pressure and open up the place for tourism. The facilities given for tourism should be cleared.”
