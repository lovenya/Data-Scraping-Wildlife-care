He alleged that officials will not be in the headquarters when people are in need of any help. “At the same time, foresters do not stay in the anti-poaching camps. Fireline is also not maintained properly. Fireline helps in checking the spread of wildfire. Anti-poaching and fire watchers are not appointed this year by the authorities,” he said and added that no patrolling vehicles are provided to keep an eye on the wildfire. The vehicles at Hebbe and Muthodi have been auctioned, he alleged.  

An awreness on forest fire has not been created among the people. Fire watch towers have also not been built. Each range needs minimum of 50 fire watchers. However, few ranges have only five watchers, he lamented.

The villagers feel that wildfire is not natural. Some miscreants throw lit beedi on the grass which catches fire which spreads to the forest. The wildlife division should take measures to check wildfire, he appealed.ADVERTISEMENT
