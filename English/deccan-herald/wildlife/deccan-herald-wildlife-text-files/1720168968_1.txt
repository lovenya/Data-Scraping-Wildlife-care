The Forest Department has urged people to donate food items for its staff, local residents and other volunteers engaged in putting out the major wildfire in the Bandipur National Park in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. 

ADVERTISEMENTPeople can donate food items that have longer shelf life such as bread, buns, biscuits, fruits and other snacks along with bottled water. These items can be deposited at the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens in Mysuru. A truck will leave the zoo every day for Bandipur to transport the food items. The first truck left at 4 pm on Friday. 

The department said that even though hundreds of people were involved in putting out the wildfire, providing food and water was a difficult task as there were no eateries near the affected places. Water, too, has become scarce in the forest. The department is supplying water from borewells to the affected areas. 

Forest officials had considered feeding animals fruits and vegetables but dropped the idea for practical reasons. The department is also looking for volunteers to mitigate the blaze. B J Hosmath, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said 200 people had sought to volunteer in Bandipur on Saturday and Sunday.
