Twenty-two people were killed by wild animals in Himachal Pradesh in the past three years, a minister said on Wednesday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe deaths took place from January 1, 2009 to January 31, 2012. In most cases, the victims were prey of leopards, forest minister Khimi Ram said in the Assembly. 

There were also 1,247 attacks on humans in this period, he added. Of this, 110 suffered serious injuries. 

“In most attacks, both on humans and livestock, bears, leopards and monkeys were mostly involved,” he said. 

Ram said the state government in 1998 authorised the chief wildlife warden to allow selective hunting of some animals that posed a threat to humans.
