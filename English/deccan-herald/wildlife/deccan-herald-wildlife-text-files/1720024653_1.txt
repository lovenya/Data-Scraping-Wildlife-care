The environmental organisations have demanded cancellation of the permission granted to KSS hotel and a resort company to convert the land in Survey No 344 and 216 in Channagondanahalli in Vasthare.

ADVERTISEMENT They have also urged to cancel the permission granted to Ravi Ramu to build a resort after converting 3.20 acres of land in Survey No 34 at Baganeheddal in Avathi hobli in Mallandur Gram Panchayat limits. 

Demanding immediate cancellation of the licences, Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust Trustee D V Girish and Wild Cat-C Trust Trustee Sridev Hulikere alleged the administration of making provisions for the hi-tech resort constructions for commercial purposes in the eco-sensitive zones including in Giri ranges.

“Issuing licences to build resorts and hotels in the eco-sensitive range would lead to the formation of concrete jungles in the forest range. With the commercial complexes using the water from the streams flowing in the forest, the villagers who are dependent on this water will be deeply affected. The waste generated in the forest and the shortage of water would lead to greater problems,” said the environmentalists in their joint statement. 

They have raised objections to the resort which is in proximity to Bhadra Wildlife Forest.

 The resort construction work has already begun in the coffee plantations at Chandradrona shrine.

The resorts are built adjacent to the Shola forests, without obtaining permission from the Forest Department. The Pollution Control Board has given permission for the resorts without considering the aspects like waste disposal and the sensitivity of the ecology, alleged the environmentalists. 

The construction of resorts would increase the traffic movement and affect the lives of wild animals which often used to take shelter in the coffee plantations too. They have urged the Deputy Commissioner to cancel the licence for the resort immediately and withdraw the permission given for land conversion.
