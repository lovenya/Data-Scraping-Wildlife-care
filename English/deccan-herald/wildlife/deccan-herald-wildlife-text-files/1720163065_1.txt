Karnataka government on Tuesday urged the Union government to  simplify the procedures for diversion of forest land under the Forest  Conservation Act 1980 for public interest programmes such drinking  water, irrigation, power projects and construction of schools and  hospitals.

ADVERTISEMENTParticipating in a meeting of state environment and forest ministers, Karnataka’s Forest Minister B Ramanath Rai said the Centre should give more powers to state governments and state boards for wildlife, apart from simplifying these procedures.

“A strong public opinion is evident in the State against eco-sensitive area notification and proposed development restrictions in the Western Ghats region. An overwhelming perception is that there are already umpteen restrictions under the existing forest, wildlife and environment statutes, and there should be no further embargo in whatsoever form it may be,” he said.

“The State is now verifying the ‘deemed forests’ by dictionary definition, as listed by an expert committee earlier, by applying objectively laid-out field criteria. An affidavit will be filed before the apex court after finalisation of field verification,” Rai said. The subject “environment” should be brought under the “concurrent” list for effective partnership and participation from States, he urged the Centre.
