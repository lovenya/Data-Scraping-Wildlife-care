The people of Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts finally heaved a sigh of relief as the High Court of Karnataka, on Tuesday, ordered an interim stay on the pumping of treated water to the districts’ lakes until further orders.ADVERTISEMENTThe order was a confirmation of people’s fear about the quality of the water pumped into the lakes.While hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the local residents, the bench confirmed that the contaminated water pumped to the lakes could jeopardize the lives of the local population dependent on these waterbodies.The KC Valley project was originally envisaged to fill several tanks in the Kolar district with treated water from Bengaluru and in turn improve the groundwater levels in the district.Last week, when water was pumped from the Bellandur Lake to the Lakshmisagara Lake, near Kolar, almost the entire state was aware of the pumped water’s polluted condition. The state government, however, claimed before the court that the quality of water pumped to the lakes—Lakshmisagar, Uddappanahalli, Jodi Krishnapura and Narasapura—met the standards and parameters stipulated by the Central government under the Environment (Protection) Rules 1986.Soon, the petitioners presented their own documents that stated that the ‘Water Quality Index (WQI)’ of these lakes was ‘unsatisfactory’. Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Prince Isac argued that the samples tested in the month of June and July 2018 proved that they exceeded some of the crucial parameters like Total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria.The high court’s order on Tuesday, according to advocate Prince Isac, is significant as it had previously, on July 4, refused to stay the same project. “We are happy that the court was able to understand the gravity of the situation and concerns of the local citizens about the quality of the treated water,” Prince told DH soon after the issue was adjourned by the court.“While the affidavit claims that the tested samples meet the parameters stipulated by the central government, the lab reports indicate WQI as unsatisfactory. In fact, the high level of coliform bacteria suggests that the water was hardly treated by the BWSSB,” Isac explained.Another advocate appearing for the petitioners Bhavya A C said:”The water fills the parched lakes and its quality has a direct impact on as many as 50 lakh people in the area. The project proponents in their DPAR have clearly stated that water supplied is for potable and recharging of groundwater table purposes. But none of the samples tested so far, proved to be fit for these purposes.”On being asked about the discrepancy between the lab reports and the affidavit, Dr Lokeshwari, the chief scientific officer at the KSPCB said: “The samples have been analysed and found to be fit for agricultural purposes but not for human consumption. According to the report, the waterfalls under Class D category, making it fit for the propagation of Wildlife and fisheries and Class E, which makes it fit for irrigation, industrial cooling and controlled waste disposal.”“The lab reports also mentioned that the WQI is Unsatisfactory as it does not fall under the Class A to Class C—the categories fit for human consumption after conventional treatment. Water falling under the Class D and Class E are unfit for the same.”
