"The cause of death will be ascertained once the test report reaches us. It will take around 15 days," he said.Whenever monkeys are found dead, the department collects samples for testing to rule out the Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), which is a highly contagious disease which causes febrile hemorrhagic illness in humans and monkeys especially in the forest.“Veterinarians found carcass of 29 monkeys, including baby monkeys on the spot. Our primary investigation suggests that the carcasses were brought from some other places and dumped at the spot. The department has been cautious about KFD, also known as monkey fever," he said.
