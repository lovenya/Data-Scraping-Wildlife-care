ADVERTISEMENT Karnataka’s very own rainforest, Agumbe is every trekker’s paradise. If you are a wildlife enthusiast, a birder, a nature lover or a photographer, get Agumbe into your travel diary. The densely forested Western Ghats is home to several species of birds and animals, and it is a delight to walk with a naturalist, around the leeches and snakes and explore the forests.

2 Badami:

 The ancient capital of the Chalukyas is home to magnificent rock-cut cave temples built around the sixth-eighth centuries. Dedicated to Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, the cave temples are not the only attractions. There are more temples, forts, gateways, dargahs and even a Bhutanatha temple near the lake. Also visit Aihole and Pattadakal to see more monuments, tanks and temples.

3 Daroji Wildlife Sanctuary:

 The shrub jungles near Hampi are home to sloth bears that have made the rocky caverns their home. Along with bears, you could even spot a leopard if you are lucky. Many believe that Daroji was one of the gateways to the Vijaynagar empire. There are close to 90 species of birds here and several migrate to this place during the winters. And while you are here, do visit Hampi and Anegundi as well across the Tungabhadra river.

4 Karwar:

 A small nondescript town which straddles mountains and seas, comprising five islands, Karwar even inspired Rabindranath Tagore to pen poems. Originally called Kadwad, it owes its name to the British who couldn’t pronounce it. Stay in Devbagh island and sail to the Kurumgad island shaped like a tortoise to see a Narasimha temple atop a hill. Now, I am told, it is an ideal place to spot seals and dolphins. Karwar is an ideal place to just relax and stretch your limbs and if you have time, drive around towards Gokarna and Om beach.

5 Melkote:

 Right atop a hillock near Mandya is Melkote, known for the Cheluvananarayana Swamy temple and the Yoga Narasimha temple. But there is more to Melkote than just a pilgrim centre. A day trip from Bangalore, Melkote is also a birder’s paradise. Home to many animals, the area around the temple is now a wildlife sanctuary. However, be it nature, wildlife or spiritual, Melkote should be on your wishlist for the sheer beauty of the place.

6 Dwarasamudra:

 Many tourists know it as Halebeedu, but this “old abode” is also Dwarasamudra or the ancient capital of the Hoysalas who ruled more than 1000 years ago. There is more to the place than just the Hoysaleshwara temple. Visit the ruins of the palace and old temples, an ancient kalyani or step well called Hulekere or the jain bastis at Basadihalli or the secluded Kedareshwar temple . If you roam around the old town, you will stumble onto several ruins or hidden temples.

7 Sringeri:

 Sringeri is not just a pilgrim’s destination. Established by Adi Sankara in the eighth century as one of the mathas, Sringeri is located on the banks of the river Tunga and the sheer scenic beauty here is bound to give you a sense of peace. Besides the Sharada temple that was built by Adi Sankara, the Vidyashankara temple built in the 14th century by Vidyaranya, the patron saint of Vijaynagar empire is a masterpiece of the art and architecture of that period . 

While you are in this region, do visit Hornadu Annapoorni and Mookambika temples if you have the time.

8 Dandeli:

 A heady mix of wildlife and adventure, Dandeli, located on the banks of the river Kali, is a great place to be if you want to do some white water rafting. The wildlife sanctuary is also a haven for birders who flock here during winter, looking for the hornbill. You can visit Ganeshgudi for more birding or Supa dam, Syntheri rocks, Cavla caves or hop over to Goa for some fun

9 Kudremukh:

 The town may be known for its iron ore mining, but Kudremukh is unparalleled in its beauty. Drive around here and you will encounter rivers, meadows, forests, waterfalls, coffee estates, wildlife and birds. 

The word, Kudremukha literally means ‘horse-face’ and it takes its name from a particular view of the mountain that resembles the face of a horse. It is an ideal getaway if you are planning for a weekend.

10 Chitradurga:

 There are several forts in and around Karnataka, but I would recommend a visit to the Chitradurga fort on the outskirts of the city. Built between the 10th and 18th centuries by various dynasties, the fort was one of the most formidable citadels.
 
Even today the battle between the Nayaks and Hyder Ali and the legend of Onake Obawa echoes from the fortress. The entire valley forms a panoramic view as you look down from here. Chitradurga is a must see if you are into a bit of history and adventure.
