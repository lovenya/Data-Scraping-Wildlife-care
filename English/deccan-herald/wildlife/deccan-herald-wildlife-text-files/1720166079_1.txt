Three performing monkeys were rescued from outside India Gate on Monday by an NGO.ADVERTISEMENT
A family of three rhesus macaques (monkeys) consisting of the father, mother, and baby were being used for entertaining local and foreign tourists visiting the famous monument by a handler (madari). On being questioned by a passerby, the handler fled the spot, leaving the monkeys behind.

 “On coming across the madari, I gently struck up a conversation with him regarding his monkeys but he pushed me aside and fled, leaving the three monkeys behind. Shortly after, another madari rushed to the site and tied the monkeys to a tree, before he too fled the scene,” said Ajay Deep Singh, who placed the call to NGO Wildlife SOS’ 24-hour rescue helpline.

Rhesus macaques are protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and capturing and using them for display and entertainment is banned and is a jailable offence under the act.

The NGO deployed a three team from their Rapid Response Unit to the location and rescued the moneys.

 “Despite being a protected species, the inhumane practise of dancing monkeys is prevalent in various parts of our country. They are constantly chained, beaten and made to starve for days as part of their training process. These highly intelligent animals are then forced to jump and perform tricks for human entertainment,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS.

Monkeys used in street performances are usually snatched from the wild at a young age and often have their teeth pulled out, leaving them helpless and unable to defend themselves.
