Unraveling mysteries of the world often requires one to look at things in new and summarised ways. Researchers at Bengaluru-based National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS) and the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur have developed a website and an immersive storytelling tool where one can interactively learn about where the different species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises (together referred to as cetaceans) are found in the world.ADVERTISEMENTThe URL of the website is https://wherearemycetaceans.co.in/.It can also tell you how many, and what species are found around your country along with other facts that can induce a sense of how majestic these animals are.Cetaceans generally occur in coastal seas and open oceans, so very little is known about most of the odd 90 species to scientists, let alone to the common man. The website has collated maps for each species created by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), condensed into a single page that updates and highlights relevant sections with the movement of your mouse pointer.This way of looking at information helps you compare different species/areas and helps you explore migratory patterns of various cetaceans. The website also shows that Indian waters harbour more than 25 species of cetaceans."A curious mind is a prerequisite for research and innovation. With so many cetaceans, several with dwindling or little-known populations, inculcating curiosity towards them is the first step towards knowing and saving them. And I hope this website would aid in facilitating it.‚Äù says Divyashree Rana, a research consultant with WWF-India, who has been closely associated with the project.
