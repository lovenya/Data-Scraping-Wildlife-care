Confirming that after the initial launch of the project in 2008, there was a delay due to unavailability of the drugs, Chand said finally the wait is over.

"There are lot of bureaucratic rules and regulation to get the drug from South Africa which is the only country in the world where it gets manufactured," he says.


With Assam being the only state in the country to have procured this all important tranquiliser, the forest officer said the project was delayed for nearly two years. Chand recalled that way back in 2008, three rhinos calves were translocated from the wildlife rehabilitation centre of the Kaziranga national park (KNP) to Manas tiger reserve while two others were transported from Pabitora game sanctuary to Manas.

"After that we hit a road block due to unavailability of the drugs but now hopefully next dry season were will go ahead int he translocation programme", he said. At least 18 rhinos are planned to be translocated to the Manas reserve next season. Translocation helps in avoiding overcrowding of animals which has been a problem of late in KNP, a world heritage site, the wildlife warden said.

As part of the initiative under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020, the rhinos were to be collected from the Pabitora sanctuary and transported by trucks to Mahanta park for relocation. However with the start of monsoon, the process had to be stopped and can be only started in the ensuing dry season.

Bibhab Talukdar, chairman of the Asian Rhino specialising group however says he fears the delay in arrival of the drugs many result in cost escalation. Despite the fact that the process will take some more money, still then it is fruitful as the capture and release of the animals will on a wild to wild basis, he said. He expressed the hope that if the programme goes on schedule, at least 18 rhinos will be identified from Pabitora and taken to Manas.

Pabitora wild life sanctuary near Guwahati has the world's highest concentration of rhinos area wise. Talukdar said ideally, the forest department people would like to have males and females in equal number to be translocated. "It has been seen that only young rhinos are collected from the source as they have better abilities to adapt themselves to a new habitat", he says.ADVERTISEMENT
