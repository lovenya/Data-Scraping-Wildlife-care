At 1650 mts, this sanctuary boasts dense forests and stunningly beautiful valleys.

The drive from Pithoragarh to Ascot offers picture-postcard scenery. We pass Pahari men, women and kids — all clad in their colourful, traditional costumes — trudging miles with their trademark smiles.ADVERTISEMENTIt’s a Wednesday afternoon. The sun blazes overhead. But we don’t really mind because we are inside the cool and dark sanctuary, hoping to spot the elusive snow leopard. As the day wears on, the birds and monkeys that chattered all morning are lulled to sleep. The hush that falls upon the sanctuary allows a few barasingha, spotted deer, musk deer and sambar to veture out and pose shyly for eager shutterbugs.

I discover that many varieties of perching, high flying, nocturnal birds have made the sanctuary their home. I see peacocks, jungle fowls, bee-eaters, kingfishers, pheasants, partridges, thrushes, woodpeckers, teals and cuckoos. Surely, Ascot is a treat for bird lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. It is also the perfect destination for an off-the-beaten track holiday. The well-preserved reserve forest is a treasure trove of flora and fauna. While we see plenty of monkeys, langurs, wild buffalos and wild dogs, the Himalayan snow leopard, the jungle cat and the striped-neck mongoose remain elusive.

Tiger tales

The highlight of our safari is the spotting of a tiger, and — believe you me — it is a magnificent sight! Along with my brother’s non-stop commentary, this epic sighting raises our excitement to fever pitch.
Exhausted from the safari, we return to the forest guest house in Ascot.
A visit to Ascot is an experience to be treasured. With its mist-cloaked hills, gurgling streams and deep gorges, it holds many a lovely surprise.

 Night in Ascot promises plenty of thrills. If you prefer a moonlight walk through the rain forest, please yourself. Then again, don’t fool yourself into believing that you are walking all by yourself! There’s plenty of company lurking around, if only you care to look closely!

It is past eight when we hit the trail the next morning. This time we are deep inside the core forest area. Today, we spot lots of reptiles and amphibians. Crocodiles, snakes and huge lizards represent the reptiles, while jackals and hyenas constitute the scavenging contingent. The jungle yields wonderful sights of herbivores such as gaur, wild boar, bear, giant squirrels and flying squirrels. Musk deer can be spotted in abundance as the wildlife sanctuary was set up with the objective of conserving their habitat and increasing their numbers.

Getting there

The best time to visit the sanctuary is from October to mid-June. During this season, the forest is covered in a lovely green and there’s a healthy nip in the air. 
We were fortunate to visit in March and feast our eyes on a beautiful panorama — the jungle was full of freshly sprouting leaves and  gorgeous scarlet flowers. The air was resonant with birdsong.If you are an adventure-loving person, who isn’t scared of wild animals, then Ascot is one thrilling place for you as it was for me!
