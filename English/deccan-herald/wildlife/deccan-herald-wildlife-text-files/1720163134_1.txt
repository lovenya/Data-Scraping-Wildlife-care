It is a pleasure to explore Brahmagiri Peak, which is a part of Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary in Kodagu. The Sanctuary stretches in a wide arc, ranging from lowland rainforests in Makutta Wildlife range to high altitude shola grasslands in Srimangala. Situated at a height of 1608 metres, Brahmagiri hill range forms a natural border between Kodagu and Wayanad.  

ADVERTISEMENTLocated at 1276 metres, on the slopes of Brahmagiri Hills, is Talacauvery, the birthplace of river Cauvery. From Talacauvery, steps lead to the nearby Brahmagiri Peak where the seven great sages are said to have performed penance.

Brahmagiri Peak offers excellent views of Kudremukh range, Wayanad and the misty Nilgiri range. Deep blue skies and wild flowers make for a wonderful experience in autumn. Monsoon is great too, if you don’t mind a little dampness. 

Along with Brahmagiri, one can explore the Palace Estate near Kakkabe situated on a flat patch just above the Nalakanad palace. The place offers a spectacular view of undulating plains. The 100-acre farm is ideal for plantation treks and is located on the edge of a forest and has a wild mountain stream.

Biodiversity found in this region is exceptional as the forests are abound with birds, wild animals, orchids, butterflies, gaurs, elephant, tigers and leopards.
