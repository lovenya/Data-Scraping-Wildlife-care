Earlier, the terrain was such that people could hardly walk in the area. Today, that has changed, because the rocks here are being shattered by dynamite. Explosions mar the peace of the people living in the area.

The whole of the Western Ghats seems to have been shaken by blasts from the quarrying. People living in the villages near the forests have complained to the police and the district administration requesting that the illegal quarrying be stopped. Following the complaint, quarrying has stopped in the day, but has continued unabated in the night. People who have protested against quarrying have received threats. As many as six cases have been registered in the Hanabalu police station in connection with these threats. 

Harming fauna
It is learnt that elephants, foxes, deer and other wildlife in the region have migrated to other areas because of the blasts. There have been instances where huge blocks of granite have fallen off lorries that transport them, and have hampered traffic in the region.

Thanks to the waste generated because of quarrying, many varieties of plants are being destroyed. The trees in the Western Ghats have also been affected because of quarrying. The roots of several trees have lost their grip because of the constant blasts, and this has led to soil erosion. The waste (including mud and gravel) have accumulated in the tanks and water bodies here. According to Thimme Gowda, leader of the Santanahalli committee against illegal quarrying, the centuries-old Gowdanakere on Herur hill is now full of silt. This silt (that includes mud and finely powdered stone) reaches the Hemavathi reservoir, Kempu Hole and Kumaradhara rivers along with rain water. The silt threatens to lower ground water levels too.

Quarrying continues in Alur taluk’s Navilahalli and Edigal, Kallu Koppal’s Hirekal, Durga, Nachgal, Doddabetta, Sakleshpur taluk’s Herur, Ucchangi, Hetthur and other hilly areas. These hills have rocks spread across 50 to 150 acres of land. Also, nearly 3,600 acres of land here has been encroached upon. Coffee estates have started to spring up in this region. Environmentalist Hetthur Devaraj explains that quarrying and encroachment of land needs to be put an end to, immediately.

According to the High Court and Supreme Court rulings, quarrying cannot be carried out in protected forest areas. But here in the villages near the Western Ghats, quarrying is being done in broad daylight. Meanwhile, the various departments (forest, environment, mines and geology, revenue) seem to have turned a blind eye to the problem. Apart from quarrying, trees are being felled in the region. Though complaints have been lodged along with adequate documents, no action has been taken, says Janapara Hitarakshana Vedike’s R Mari Joseph. Villagers have staged several protests against quarrying, but the government doesn’t seem to pay any attention.

Official reaction
“Great loss!” exclaimed Deputy Commissioner Naveen Raj Singh, when his attention was drawn to quarrying, and the loss of precious flora in the Western Ghats. “Permission has not been given for quarrying in the Western Ghats, and none will be given either. I have directed the Department concerned to put an end to the mining here. Still, there have been complaints. We will conduct raids and put an end to quarrying,” he explains.“There is no doubt that mining in the forest areas of the Western Ghats or on revenue land is illegal. Mining has a lot of ill-effects on the wildlife in the region. Rare herbs are being destroyed. Water resources are being harmed,” explains Deputy Conservator of Forests Ambadi Madhav and adds that a report has already been submitted to the government and the district administration seeking a ban on quarrying.ADVERTISEMENT
