An adult black kite, which was entangled in a manja and suspended in air between a cellular tower and a tree at a height of 130 feet, was rescued from Austin Town on Monday.

ADVERTISEMENTNigar, a resident, who noticed the bird’s ordeal on Monday morning informed People for Animals (PFA) rescue centre, which in turn sent PFA rescuer Chethan Sharma to the spot. 

Unable to scale the hieght even with the equipment provided by the Bescom and Fire department, Sharma climbed the tower and slowly pulled the bird towards him after cutting the string attached to the tower. 

Once he got hold of the bird, Chethan cut the remaining part of the string and examined the bird for injuries. The feathers of the bird, which was entangled in manja for the past two days, were twisted by the deadly string. The bird was provided first aid on site and brought to PFA’s Wildlife Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre at Kengeri, where it is being treated for injuries.  The rescue centre can be reached at 99803 39880 / 99803 39880.
