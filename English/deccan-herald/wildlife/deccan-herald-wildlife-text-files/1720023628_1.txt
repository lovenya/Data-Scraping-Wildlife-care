Western Ghats Task Force Chairman Ananth Hegde Ashisara said that the community should raise their voice to conserve the sources of river and forest. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe public should join hands with the Forest department in taking measure to conserve the forest. 

Speaking at two-day workshop on ‘Western Ghats and classification flora in coastal region,’ organised by the Department of Botany of MGM College, Western Ghats Task Force and Kundapura forest department here at MGM College on Monday, he said “we have failed to act even when there was attack on environment. 

With the destruction of forest, the ground water level has started depleting. The Western Ghats Task Force will organise awareness programmes in colleges to conserve forest.”   

The researchers have played a vital role in conserving Devara Kaadu. There is a need to take up research on flora and micro organisms. 

He said the forest fire damages valuable flora and fauna in the forest. There is a need to initiate measure to check the forest fire.

APCCF, Bangalore Vice Principal Dr M H Swaminath said that  “Western Ghats is known for its diversity. There is a need to take up research on the diversity of Western Ghats. 

There is ample scope in the field of Botany. The destruction of forest is taking a toll on the environment in the form of rise in the temperature.”
