We are not talking of any biodiversity hotspot, nor is it a slice of the Western Ghats. This oasis is in arid Gulbarga district, in Chincholi, a taluk, to be precise. 

You can spot many trees that grow in the Western Ghats apart from many medicinal plants. Large trees, used for timber, are also present in thousands of numbers.

Some parts of Andhra Pradesh’s forest area, and this region (Chincholi forest area), which encompasses more than 50,000 acres, is known as the Konchavaram forest. 
During the rainy season, the forest draws tourists from Karnataka as well as Andhra Pradesh.

There are many places of interest for tourists in Konchavaram forest. Ettipothe falls is one of the more interesting spots among them. As soon as the rainy season starts, the cascade gets a fresh lease of life and you can enjoy its glory till December. Many small streams flow in the forest and join the Mulla Maari river. At the border of Chincholi taluk, Ettipothe tumbles down the black stones at a height of 25 feet. 

A dam constructed across the river Mulla Maari is another picnic spot. One side of the dam offers a view of the water expanse, while on the other is the forest. Boating facilities are also available here.

‘Wah Talaab!’
 During the Nizam rule, kings were known to visit the ‘lal talaab’ (red tank) here with kith and kin to relax. The bunds of this tank, spread over 10 acres, were built more than hundred years ago and are still in a good condition.

‘Haathi Pakadi’ is another interesting place to visit. The elephants of the Nizam were brought to this place, therefore giving it its name, ‘Haathi Pakadi’, the resting site of elephants. Spread over an acre of land, a deep trench has been dug around it to keep elephants inside. Rare medicinal plants and huge trees are found in Gottamgotta, where a splendid view of both the river and the forest can be had. A small pond providing sweet water called Siddhagunda has never gone dry.

 “Even during the severe drought conditions of 1972, this pond was full of water. People from nearby villages depended on Siddhagunda back then,” points out Ratnamma, a resident of the region.

The region is also known for its wildlife including wolves, wild pigs, blackbucks, deer and peacocks. “I have spotted many leopards here when I was young. Last year too, I spotted a leopard in the forest,” says Madivalayya, another localite.

Wildlife sanctuary
Konchavaram will soon be declared a wild life sanctuary. When State wildlife Board Vice-Chairman Anil Kumble visited the forest to gather public opinion, he was thrilled to see the verdant greenery of the region. 

“This is one of the rare forests in Hyderabad Karnataka region. We have sent a proposal seeking shifting of villagers from the forest area,” explains Conservator of Forests A Radhadevi.
