Tribal villagers in Assam have voluntarily shifted their settlement from a major elephant corridor.  Eighteen families of Ram Terang village in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district gave a new meaning to animal conservation in the country on Thursday by shifting to a new village.  

Ram Terang village is right in the middle of the Kalapahar-Daigurung jumbo corridor, a key elephant movement passage in Assam. It took almost five years of continuous efforts by a dedicated team from the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) to persuade the villagers to shift to a new place, since the area was increasingly becoming a hotbed of man-elephant conflict.

 The villagers, who once used to chase away elephants by shooting from air guns and lighting fire, now are their protectors. They have moved to the New Ram Terang village. By Christmas, the entire new village will be ready, WTI sources added. The forest department is also supporting the initiative.
