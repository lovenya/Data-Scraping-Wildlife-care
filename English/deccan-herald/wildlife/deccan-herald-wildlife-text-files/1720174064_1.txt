A nature-loving British couple have moved to an island inhabited only by 10,000 birds after winning a competition for the posts of the isle’s wildlife wardens.

ADVERTISEMENTGiselle Eagle, 27, and boyfriend Richard Brown, 32, are the only two people on Skokholm Island, off Pembrokeshire, West Wales, The Sun reported.

The island’s red sandstone cliffs are home to thousands of birds, including Manx Shearwaters, storm petrels and puffins.

Giselle and Richard beat competition from hundreds of other applicants for the job of island wardens for the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.

They now look after the bird colony and renovations, including repairs to the country’s first purpose-built seabird observatory.

The trust’s website warned prospective wardens of the trials to be faced in the job, such as “long nights haunted by the strangest of noises”.

It was the couple’s experience of living in remote locations that helped them get the job.
Richard has lived on small islands off Wales for the past seven years, while Giselle has been a volunteer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) for many years.
