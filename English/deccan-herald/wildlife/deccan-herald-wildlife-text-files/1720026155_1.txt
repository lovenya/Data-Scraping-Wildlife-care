The Centre on Wednesday sought permission from the Supreme Court to allow tourism in up to 20 per cent area of tiger reserves in the country. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe Centre’s stand is in sharp contrast to its previous stand seeking complete ban on tourism in the core area of the tiger reserves.

The apex court on July 24 as an interim measure said that till further orders, no tourists should venture into core zones of 41 tigers reserves.

“Current tourism zones where only visits are permitted and there are no consumptive uses, tiger density and recruitment do not seem to be impacted. Hence, permitting up to 20 per cent of the core/critical tiger habitat as a tourism zone should not have an adverse effect on the tiger biology needs,” the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) said in a change of stand.

“It is recommended that a maximum 20 per cent of the core/critical tiger habitat usage (not exceeding the present usage) for regulated, low-impact tourist visitation may be permitted,” it said.

However, the new guidelines said that no new tourism infrastructure should be created in the core areas while existing residential infrastructure in such areas should be strictly regulated to adhere to low ecological impacts.

“Conservation of the tiger, our national animal, is the paramount objective of tiger reserves and generating public support through regulated tourism is an invaluable tool for harnessing support for tiger conservation. 

“Non-consumptive regulated, low-impact tourism, could be permitted within core/critical tiger habitat without in any way compromising the spirit of core/critical tiger habitat for tiger conservation,” the guidelines, to be applicable to the tiger reserves notified under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, said.
