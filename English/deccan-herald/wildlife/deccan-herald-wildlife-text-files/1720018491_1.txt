Although the anthology promises a fresh and distinct voice, it does not quite hit the mark, writes Monideepa Sahu

The blurb promises “fresh and distinct voice...which confirms that good writing continues to flourish.” However, unknown gems do not appear to have been painstakingly gleaned from the slush pile for this volume. Many of the contributors already have books to their credit, and others have books on the anvil. This mix-and-match jumble of divergent genres and styles seems more a showcase and preview of their forthcoming books, rather than a collection of the startlingly unexpected.

On the whole, the non-fiction pieces are more exciting than the fiction selection, with unusual topics and points of view. The Town of Nine Lives by Tsering Wang Dhompa stands out as a vibrant and engaging account of a young exile’s visit to her native Tibet, as she non-judgmentally notes “the city’s exultant participation in China’s new prosperity.” We see, learn and feel through the writer’s perspective as we accompany her on a journey through a land where two cultures are colliding.

Tibetans cling to their old faith and customs in their struggle to remind themselves of their unique identity. Chinese tourists with sophisticated cameras are bemused by Tibetan language and customs, as they politely try to escape from pungent whiffs of animal fat. 

Having suffered imprisonment to purge themselves of incorrect beliefs or attitudes, Tibetans find themselves in a new world of concrete and seek a way to live. The new dispensation has its benefits. “Five decades ago it took close to 20 days to reach Xining on horseback from Kyegu.” Aunt Tashi marvels at what she thinks is “some divine machination that allowed her to cover the distance in 12 hours by jeep.” Such descriptions of change and emotional reactions to change strengthen the impact of this literary essay.

Forward to the Past is a lucidly written essay about what makes India, India. “This living presence of the past, in the landscape as much as in its inhabitants,” fascinates Michael Danino. He recounts Andre Malraux explaining that “the west was about having while Asia was about being.” Suresh Chandvankar’s The Discographer is another interesting essay about a friend passionate about discography; “a discipline about studying everything seen on a gramophone disc or record.”

Ultimately, the world is apathetic to vanishing art and labours of love. Rama Lakshmi’s A Museum Evangelist’s Persuasions urges the reader to understand “why 
objects are the portal through which we enter another’s reality and other worlds… Museums act as memory-keepers for our society.” She makes a case, in a tone more appealing to a learned museum curator than lay readers, for a museum portraying the Bhopal gas tragedy, and the Bhopalis’ long struggle for justice. Here is an opportunity for an Indian museum to evolve from safe, static displays into having a voice in the public discourse.

Atiya Hussain’s Srinagar Diaries shows the changes, the ‘thawing’, in Kashmir 
today. As a man recounts, in a most matter-of-fact manner, how he was rescued from one of Srinagar’s infamous torture centres, the author’s sense of security is dented. Yet, tensions also lift in Srinagar at times, “to the point of hilarity. It was as if, all of a sudden, the city was breathing again, quite unlike the uncanny silence of the previous day.” The essay concludes well on a sobering note. 

Gopalan is about a social worker’s experiences with two mentally challenged elderly brothers. The narrative can get dull and repetitive at times: “As we wait, Raghavan, then Gopalan, visit the toilet. Mamata Tai returns just before one thirty… she announces that she’s ready to leave. We all leave the office…”

The Evacuation of Anantpura is a dated account of evacuating villagers from a wildlife sanctuary and can read like an official report. Intimations within News Film Footage is a confusing running commentary of events depicted in news film clips. Colin L Fernandes’ The Bridge is about a doctor son from America visiting his ailing father in India. The essay is not striking in subject or style, but many readers can relate to the situation and sentiments expressed.

The short stories are readable but unremarkable. The House at the Corner and Bringing Home a Naxalite, well-crafted stories with child protagonists, are the pick of the bunch. A Ramnath’s Dear Ambassador is a light, entertaining non-fiction account placed in the fiction section. The writer’s reminiscence about the beloved family car makes us smile a while before we carry on with life. 

The Fag End, Ceasefire, and Taj Mahal by Moonlight don’t weigh the reader down with complicated stories, or ask for much time or concentration. Breezy reads, just right for reading in airport lounges, these are probably trailers for books forthcoming from the Metro Reads imprint. On the other hand, Gitanjali Kolanad’s Shadow Planet appears more complex and does demand more time and concentration. But one comes away wondering whether one has completely understood it.
