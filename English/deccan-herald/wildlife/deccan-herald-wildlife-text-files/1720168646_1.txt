“Trees are the earth’s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.’’ True to this quote of Rabindranath Tagore, a bunch of city-based wildlife volunteers and naturalists are holding tree walks for those who want to know more about these green angels. 

Held every week, mostly on Sundays, the walks enable one to observe and listen to trees, the rustling leaves, chirping of birds nestled on them and more. The three-hour walk held in green lung spaces like Cubbon Park, Lalbagh Botanical Gardens, Hesaraghatta, Turahalli forest and Kanakapura taluk includes introduction to trees and Bengaluru’s geography along with  identification of leaves and tree species.

The walks are held under the banner 'Budding Explorers'. Karthik Samprathi, a wildlife volunteer with Karnataka forest department and one of the organisers said the demand for such walks is increasing.

“There is no age limit and anyone can take part in it. The last edition conducted on April 2 witnessed 
participation of around 15 children and 10 adults. We also hold ant watching and bird watching sessions on weekends. We have around 10 staffers with us of whom six are trained naturalists," he added.  

Karthik said the main objective of tree walks is to make people familiar with the trees and varied tree species in the Garden City. 

Vasudha V T who had earlier taken part in tree walks with her daughter said she was thrilled to take part in it and said it was a learning experience. "We got to know of Lalbagh more deeply although I have visited it several times," she added.
