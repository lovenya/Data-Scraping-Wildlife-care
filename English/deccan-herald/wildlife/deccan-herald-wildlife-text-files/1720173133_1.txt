Even stray animals, including abandoned ones, will be allowed in the proposed facility".Further describing the sanctuary, Gopalan minister Otaram Dewasi said, "It will be made on the lines of a wildlife sanctuary and will be managed by a private trust."

Spread over 472 hectares, the sanctuary was developed by the MP Gau Samvardhan Board in Salaria village.Other cow initiativesThis move is the latest in a list of initiatives announced by the BJP government in the state for the protection of cows since it came to power in 2013. The announcement of the sanctuary comes exactly a month after the state government levied a 20% surcharge on stamp duty towards cow protection.Earlier in 2017, the state had announced a 10 percent surcharge on stamp duty towards cow protection. In 2015, Rajasthan had become the first state to have a separate department and ministry for the welfare of cows.Moreover, Rajasthan government is also planning to come up with Bull safari for the visitors at Hingonia Gaushala, the biggest Gaushala with approximately 20,000. The tourists visiting the desert state will now be able to see the cattle of cows, buffaloes and bulls roaming around in the open grounds.
