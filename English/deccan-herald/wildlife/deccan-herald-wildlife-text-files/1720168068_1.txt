The presence of a rather peculiar animal on the premises of the Institute Of Liver And Biliary Sciences in South Delhi, took their staff by surprise. A civet cat was spotted wandering around the parking area of the centre at Vasant Kunj.

ADVERTISEMENTThe small mammal was later rescued by NGO Wildlife SOS later. Pramod Sharma, a staff member of the institute, reported the incident to the NGO on its 24-hour rescue helpline, after which a two-member rescue team was sent to the location.

The ‘rapid response’ team, upon arrival, identified the animal as an Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphrodites), a small member of the family Viverridae native to South and Southeast Asia. They are an omnivorous species that feed on fruits, berries, coffee beans, insects and small mammals.

It took almost 30 minutes for the rescuers to catch hold of the animal. “The Asian Palm Civet, also called a toddy cat, is a small mammal that can survive in a wide range of habitats,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder of Wildlife SOS.
