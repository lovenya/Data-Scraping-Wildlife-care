While utilising any produce from National Park or protected forests without prior permission from the Union Government is strictly prohibited, it is being said that the Forest Department is giving its consent to axe the trees by observing an ‘enigmatic silence,’ each year. The car festival will be held on April 27 and the devotees have planned to axe the trees in Biligiriranga Temple Wildlife Sanctuary (BRT) on March 30.

The fibrous tree, which grows only in forests is the principal fodder for elephants, particularly during summer. Bees also prefer the tree for nesting. Shortage of fodder for pachyderms during summer is a natural phenomena and, the problem has aggravated this year with bamboo and grass in the forest drying up. 

The migration of elephants in search of food from Chamarajnagar, Bandipur, BRT and other areas was affected following construction of Kabini dam in 1979-80.  Axing ‘Bende’ trees at this juncture would therefore compel pachydrems trespass into human territory for foraging.
On the other hand, the Forest Department has submitted a proposal to the Union Government seeking to declare BRT as Protected Tiger Reserve.

The public opinion is that instead of assembling a new car every year by cutting trees, it would be eco-friendly to build a car with quality wood available at the timber depots of the Forest Department. That would serve twin purposes - observation of the religious ritual as well as forest conservation.
