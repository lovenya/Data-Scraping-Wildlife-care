Officials said the youth was missing from his house as he has left for Mumbai. While the department has found traces of cooked frog at his place in Ribandar village, near here.
His parents are being questioned, they said.

The Indian Bull Frog is a protected species as per wildlife protection rules and State Forest department has formed squads to crack down on poaching of frogs, which usually happens during monsoons here.

The youth identifying himself as Yoko Gomes, had uploaded the post on Facebook.
Wild Goa Network, a green NGO, had complained to the forest department about the poaching and post on the website.

"We had downloaded all the content from Facebook and attached it with the complaint," Clinton Vaz, an activist of Wild Goa Network, told PTI.

The NGO which has been campaigning for last six years against frog poaching has said that they conduct awareness drive before the monsoons.

Vaz said they attained major success last year when they along with forest department managed to arrest a person with 60 live frogs in Margao town.ADVERTISEMENT
