The State government has dropped the proposal to extend the area of eco-sensitive zone in the Bhadra Tiger Reserve and Kudremukh National Park, Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda has said.

ADVERTISEMENTA high-level committee meeting held on December 24 considered the opposition from the local people for the proposal. The elected representatives from the region brought the matter to the notice of the meeting and the government decided to shelve the idea, Gowda said at a press meet here on Sunday.

The chief minister said the reclassification of protected areas in Bannerghatta National Park, Mukambika, Someshwara, Cauvery and Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuaries would continue as planned. 

He said the government was convinced that only development could put an end to the naxal menace in Malnad.
