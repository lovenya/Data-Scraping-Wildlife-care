The national youth-level campaign, known as ‘Cities for Forests’, focuses on creating awareness about the link between forests and human wellbeing.

Students from the Army Public School, Poorna Prajna Vidyaniketan, Jayanagar, Parikarma Learning Foundation, Mount Carmel College, and St Joseph’s Arts College took part in the campaign, which included hanging boards with environment-friendly messages on them on trees in Cubbon Park.

Sensitising shoppers
Cynthia of WWF said the idea was to raise awareness among shoppers and passersby about the importance of urban spaces and green spaces in cities. 

The United Nations has declared 2011 as the International Year of Forests. 
The campaign will be launched in 20 cities across the country.

The campaign also calls people to discover the forests within the cities and experience its biodiversity and overall health. People can visit www.citiesforforests.in and share their experience by uploading stories, poems, pictures, videos or songs.

To bring change
The campaign will culminate in October, when WWF, in partnership with schools, will organise events where the findings of groups of students or individuals will be presented to key decision-makers, local politicians and experts and advisors to the city government, to build positive pressure towards the issue and bring about a change.
