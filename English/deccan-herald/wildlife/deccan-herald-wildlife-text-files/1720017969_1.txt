Security personnel recovered the two decomposed bodies lying in a ditch in Dhanchatani village in Ayodhya Hill area Friday. 

"The bodies have been sent for autopsy and DNA test for identification. We suspect that the bodies are those of Intelligence Bureau officer Partha Biswas and school teacher Soumyajit Basu, who were believed to have been abducted by the Maoists about five months back,‚Äù said Superintendent of Police Sunil Chowdhury.

Biswas and Basu went missing from Ghatbera near Balarampur in Ayodhya Hills Oct 23. Police claimed that Maoists had abducted them, but failed to trace them in the past five months. However, the Maoists have repeatedly denied their involvement. 

"The bodies were recovered from the spot where the duo were last seen by the locals prior to their abduction. And even a motorbike believed to have been used by them was also found near the spot. For these reasons, the locals and police are suspecting that the bodies are those of Biswas and Basu," said Chowdhury.

"But nothing can be said for sure without a DNA test as the bodies found were highly decomposed and beyond recognition. The relatives of Biswas and Basu will be requested to visit Purulia town for identification of the shreds of clothes found on the bodies," he said.

Both Biswas and Basu were involved with an NGO working on wildlife conservation and tribal issues. They had not informed the Purulia police about their visit to Maoist-affected places.
