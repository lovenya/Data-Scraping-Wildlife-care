Wildlife officials in Thailand say they have discovered the carcasses of five more wild elephants downstream from a waterfall where the bodies of six other elephants were found last weekend.ADVERTISEMENTNational Parks spokesman Sompote Maneerat says the carcasses were discovered by a drone being used to investigate how the first six elephants plunged to their deaths at the Haew Narok — Ravine of Hell — waterfall in Khao Yai National Park in northeastern Thailand.Park officials say the first group of elephants evidently died when trying to reach a dead calf.Sompote said Tuesday that the death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai.The elephant population at the park is estimated to be about 300.
