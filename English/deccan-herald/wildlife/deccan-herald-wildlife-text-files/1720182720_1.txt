Environmentalists have urged the authorities to conserve the sources of rivers which take birth in the Western Ghats. ADVERTISEMENTThe major rivers that take birth in the rain forest and Shola forest of the Western Ghats have dried up during this summer. The water crisis has aggravated in villages and towns. The water-level in River Nethravathi at Dharmasthala has depleted drastically.The flow of Nethravathi, Tunga and Bhadra have declined, said the environmentalists. D V Girish of Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust, Sridev Hulikere of Wildcat-C and wildlife activist G Veeresh said that Kapila and other rivulets too have dried. Will River Nethravathi be saved from destruction if the Shishila-Bhairapura four-lane road is laid? he asked. The implementation of mega projects in the Western Ghats will pose a threat to the source of rivers and its flow, they insisted.
