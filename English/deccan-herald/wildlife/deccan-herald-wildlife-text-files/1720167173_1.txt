Sidda, the wild elephant at the Manchanabele dam, is on the road to recovery, according to a professor of the Government Veterinary College who visited him on Wednesday. 

ADVERTISEMENTA team of vets, including Dr L Ranganath, professor and head of surgery of the college, said that Sidda has developed an enormous callus (a thickened and hardened part of the skin or soft tissue) around his right fore leg which is why he was unable to walk. “Sidda has suffered a fracture, although it is not visible even through radiography. There are certain symptoms and formations which normally develop after a fracture. He has been lying down for a long time due to which he has developed wounds and sores which can be treated. If he is given the right care, he will be able recover within 60 days,” added Dr Ranganath. 

He added that he was looking at Sidda’s injuries 78 days after they were caused. But a lot could have been done much earlier, he said. “Although he will not be able to recover completely, he will be able to survive with his deformity,” Dr Ranganath said.

Earlier, several experts had said that Sidda will not survive with his injured leg and had lost ‘conservation value’. However, vets from the Wildlife SOS have been administering medicines to Sidda and had even approached the Army to construct a structure to make Sidda stand.

The Madras Engineer Group (MEG) have constructed an improvised structure and ever since, Sidda has been made to stand with the support of a harness. 

Chief Wildlife Warden W B Hosmath said the department had been following instructions of the vets from the beginning, and there has been no delay from the department’s end.

“Had Sidda broken his leg somewhere in middle of a forest, the department would have left him to be taken care of by nature. Since he was located close to the city, he is getting all the attention,” added Hosmath.
