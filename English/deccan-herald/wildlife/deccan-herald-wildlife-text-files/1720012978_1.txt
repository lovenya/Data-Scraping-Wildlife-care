Woken up by a recent study by researchers of the Wildlife Science Department of the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS) here that found nearly 90 per cent of the temple elephants suffering from one or more serious foot ailments, there is at last some action.

The study forced veterinarians, foresters, zoo-keepers, temple administrators and mahouts (including of privately-owned elephants) discuss the health aspects of temple elephants in TN at the Vandaloor Zoological Park near here recently. The net result was a new diet and fitness regimen was finalised for the jumbos, official sources told ‘Deccan Herald’ on Sunday.

Thus the 15-year-old Parvathy, the pachyderm brought from Assam who attracts thousands of pilgrims at the famous Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, now at least has a shower-bath twice a day after authorities fixed a new shower for her and enjoys being bathed with 6,000 litres of water per day.

The mahouts at various temples have been firmly told to take them out on hour-long walks twice a day. The authorities even took steps to part-simulate the forest environs in the respective elephant sheds, sources said. The new enriched dietetics for the jumbos was aimed at improving their overall health, said Padmanabhan, Joint Commissioner and Executive Officer of the Meenakshi temple.

The daily menu for an adult temple elephant includes 250 kg of grass to be supplemented by 50 kg of twigs and leaves from mango or neem trees. They are also fed with large nutritious balls (‘Urundai’ in Tamil) thrice a day. Its ingredients include 7 kg of cooked rice, mixed with 1.5 kg each of green gram and horse gram, 1 kg of jaggery, 100 grams of common salt and 25 grams turmeric powder among others. Plus the inevitable dessert of at least a dozen bananas after each meal!

Besides these, the temple elephants will need to be given a periodic oil massages with ‘Mattham Thailam’, a licensed ‘Siddha’ doctor who regularly attends on the Madurai Temple elephant added. Apart from multi-vitamin tablets, ‘Ashta Choornam’ (a mix of eight traditional pharmacopoeia) is to be given to these elephants once a month to ensure they did not suffer from indigestion. It has also been decided to give each pachyderm 3.5 kg of the Ayurvedic nutritious supplement, ‘Chavanapraash’ every three months. Allopathic veterinary doctors would also examine the elephants every fortnight and administer them injections if needed. Temple elephants beyond cure might be sent back to the forests, state Hindu Religious Endowments Minister,  K R Periyakaruppan said.

Implementing all these considerably add to the elephants’ maintenance costs. For Parvathy alone, “our cost now shoots up to Rs 80,000 per month,” Padmanabhan said. As not all shrines have such extensive incomes, people donating pachyderms to temples had been asked to also pay upfront a deposit of Rs 10 lakh per elephant, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
