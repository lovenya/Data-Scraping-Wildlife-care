After the forest fire in Kurangani Hills in Tamil Nadu, where nine trekkers died, the state Forest department has decided to ban trekkers and tourists during the forest fire season.ADVERTISEMENTThough every year it is a practice not to allow people in such areas during the dry season, now special instructions have been issued, following the incident in the neighbouring state. The dry season is between December and April. Â "Strict instructions have been issued to the ground staff not to trek in areas which are prone to forest fire. There is a need to take special care to ensure that there are no untoward incidents," Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) C Jayaram told DH.He said the instructions were also to be followed in areas wherever there is dry grass. The department has also made it clear that only those who are physically fit to handle the terrain and help forest staff during emergencies like forest fire can trek in the forests during the dry season. By doing so, the department hopes to regulate the crowd and make them more responsible towards conservation, he said.The department offices across Karnataka are flooded with applications from enthusiasts seeking permission for trekking. But they are being turned away, stating that there is a shortage of monitoring staff.Many local residents and religious leaders also visit the offices seeking permission to enter the forests to perform rituals. They too are being denied entry."There has already been enough damage to the forests. So, we have decided not to allow people," said forest officials from Dandeli, Bandipur and MM Hills.The department has also controlled eco-trails where trained guides take groups of 10 people on dedicated trek routes.
