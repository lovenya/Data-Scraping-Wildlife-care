Wildlife activists have raised concern over ongoing work on widening of the road from Seethalayyanagiri to Mullayyanagiri in Chikkamagaluru taluk. 

ADVERTISEMENTD V Girish of Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust and Girijashankar, former member of Wildlife Board, said that the road work on the highest peak of the state will result in ecological disaster. 
Mullayyanagiri is the highest peak in the state - 6,317 feet above the sea level. Below Mullayyanagiri lies Seethalayyanagiri. 

“If the soil is removed while laying the road in a sensitive area, then it can cave in during monsoon,” he said. In the recently held meeting chaired by the deputy commissioner, it was decided to develop a road and later start a mini bus facility from Seethalayyanagiri to reduce the density of vehicles in the region. 

However, for the past two days, soil is being removed at the site in the name of road development. There was no need for widening of the road on the peak, which is ecologically sensitive area, the wildlife activists opined.

The construction of the retaining wall and widening of the road will facilitate the movement of vehicles, which in turn will affect the movement of wild animals. Vehicles should be allowed only till Seethalayyanagiri and later, visitors should trek to Mullayyanagiri to reduce the impact on nature, they said.
