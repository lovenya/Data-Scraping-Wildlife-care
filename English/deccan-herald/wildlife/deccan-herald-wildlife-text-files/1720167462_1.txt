Deputy Commissioner Richard Vincent D’Souza directed officials to show progress in the construction of houses for Jenukuruba community members in the district. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe houses are being constructed under Traditional Dwellers’ Development Project. 

Chairing a meeting here, he said that the housing projects should be completed within the time frame. A total of 820 houses are yet to be constructed, he added. 

Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) officer Sathish said 1,108 beneficiaries have been selected for the construction of 1,250 houses. The remaining 142 beneficiaries are yet to be identified, he added. 

Zilla panchayat CEO Charulatha Somal said permission has to be taken from the Forest Department for the construction of drinking water projects and toilets in wildlife areas. 

Committee member Somaiah said the tribals have affinity with wild animals and nature. At least three acres of farm land should be sanctioned to them to cultivate and lead a dignified life. ITDP officer Sathish said 18 beneficiaries have been selected for training in light vehicle driving.
