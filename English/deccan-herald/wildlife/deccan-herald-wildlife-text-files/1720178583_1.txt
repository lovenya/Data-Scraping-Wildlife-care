In an effort to protect wildlife, movement of goods vehicles has been banned on National Highway 948, Bannari-Dimbam ghat, under the Sathyamangalam tiger reserve in Tamil Nadu, between 6 pm and 6 am.ADVERTISEMENTIt is a major road that connects Karnataka with Tamil Nadu. It is also a major trade route as it connects with Coimbatore and Tiruppur, major business centres of the neighbouring state. Stakeholders said even though the order aims at conserving wildlife, it will affect farmers and traders.The Erode deputy commissioner has taken this decision, following suggestions by the road safety committee, for protection of wildlife. “The ghat section on the highway has 27 hairpin bends and the movement of any vehicle with 12 or more wheels is banned. Besides, the speed of other vehicles should not exceed 30 km from 6 pm to 6 am,” the DC’s order states.“The district administration will allow the vehicles only after checking their weight at Hasanuru and Bannari checkposts. A toll fee for all vehicles, except government and emergency vehicles like ambulances, will be introduced soon,” the order of the DC states.
