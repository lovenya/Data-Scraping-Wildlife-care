Sensing the urgency in conserving the ecosystem, a young group of naturalists, wildlife filmmakers and anthropologists led by naturalist Mohan Kumar from Mysore, started ‘Emerald Quest’ (EQ) to improve awareness among the society about the importance of nature and wildlife.

Speaking to City Herald, Kumar said  their venture was aimed at providing environmental education and documentation of biological species. Having involved himself in supporting environmental education for more than 10 years, Kumar said that educational programmes for school children in areas around Mysore and Kodagu were organised recently, where children learnt about the rich biodiversity surroundings.

There is a need to ‘inform’ people about the preventive measures that can be taken up to check forest fires, which happen frequently in areas surrounding the forests. “Most people think that loss of biodiversity isn’t harmful to them. But, it will have an adverse impact on their lives and we are trying to make them understand about the importance of environmental sustainability.”

He said that apart from studying the ecological patterns in the region, they are also working on identifying the problems faced by the locals and later provide workable solutions for them. Supporting this venture are many volunteers, who are mainly pursuing their degree courses, and want to help in conservation and protection of ecology.

Taking it forward, EQ is planning a ‘Salim Ali Biking Expedition’ in February for students and professionals alike, who are interested in knowing more about the rich biodiversity prevalent in the Western Ghats. Kumar said that even though many people know the broader perspective of saving the biodiversity, many fail in identifying individual species and their importance. The expedition will aim to increase their knowledge about individual species and their role in the food chain.

Participants will also get a chance to hone their photography skills during the expedition as it will also include filmmakers.

Apart from visiting schools, the group aims to spread the message using social networking sites. One and two minute videos created during their visit is uploaded regularly on websites such as Facebook. Activities are held during weekends involving students as well.

The EQ plans to undertake a teachers’ training programme in Kodagu and H D Kote in association with Zoo Outreach Organisation (ZOO), Coimbatore. He said that resources personnel from the ZOO will provide awareness material to the teachers so that they can reach out to parents and students. 

The major concern for EQ is the man-animal conflict that is increasing in forest areas. He said, “We need to change our attitude a little bit and understand the cause of the problems.” Human encroachment and loss of forest habitat are areas that need to be addressed seriously and sensibly.

Commenting on the activities of EQ, volunteer Tilak Ranga said that they importance is given to bird watching, trekking, identifying flora and fauna. Information about indigenous species are highlighted during the weekend visits that are undertaken by the group. He said that many of the group members can now identify more than 300 bird species. He says, “Once you come out of school or college, there is a lack of basic knowledge about the environment. We are trying to change that by letting them ask questions that they never ask in a classroom.” 

Citing an example, he said, “Without pollination caused by a butterfly, it wouldn’t be possible to have agriculture or horticulture.”  The aim is to inform people about the importance of every species that we come across and their role in a complex ecosystem.

 He said that recently campaigns such as ‘Getting along with elephants’ and ‘Live more simple life’ were held at Melkote and Kodagu. During these visits to schools, various superstitions are also addressed. For Tilak observing the wide variety of birds and their migratory path is a fascination. He said that the diseases affecting birds, impact of seasonal changes are an area of great importance. Another area of interest that people can enjoy by joining EQ is photography. “If you say photography, the first thing that comes to your mind is Digital SLR cameras. But, here shooting better pictures by just using an ordinary digital camera can also be learnt,” he added.
