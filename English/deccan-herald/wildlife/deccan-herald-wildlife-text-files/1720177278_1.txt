Some dried bamboos that were posing a threat to visitors, are being felled by the Forest Department (Wildlife Division) at Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in the taluk.ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to DH, Sanctuary’s Deputy Range Forest Officer Puttamadegowda said, “The dried bamboos were coming in contact with electric cables and are thus being felled. The Chief Conservator of Forests has given permission to axe 3,000 trees.”

However, he clarified that the bamboos that are being felled are far from nesting places, and are instead on pedestrian walks near electric poles and cables and at places that pose a threat to the public.“There are more than 200 varieties of birds in the sanctuary. The bamboo clumps are felled only after ensuring that it does not affect birds or nests,” he said.A few bamboos that are more than 45-years-old have flowered and dried. As they were on the verge of collapsing, the employees brought it to the notice of higher officials, who accorded permission to fell them.The axed bamboos will be sold to the Medar community people, who are bamboo craftsmen, at discounted prices.Labourers from Tamil Nadu are on the job and will complete it by the end of November, officials stated.
