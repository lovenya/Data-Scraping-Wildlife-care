It is suspected that these bags of garbage dumped on the roadside are from Kerala since they are found at four places within one km from the State border.

This has raised questions as to what forest, police and commercial tax officials are doing at the Makutta checkpost. On the left side of the State highway is the Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary and to the right is the Makutta Range of forests. The density of wildlife is quite high in these forests.

During rainy season, the wastes flow into the numerous streams in the region and join Barapole in Kodagu. The wildlife drink this water. The water from Barapole further joins Kootupole and this water is used by the people of Kerala, points P M Muttanna, honorary wildlife warden.

While it is mandatory for officials of the three departments to check every goods vehicle entering the State, the heaps of garbage stand testimony to their gross negligence.ADVERTISEMENT
