With the fascinating world of plantation tourism opening up in the Southern states of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, intrepid travellers are making a beeline to the lush green estates to savour the unique pleasure of gracious living in the lap of nature. The genesis of plantation tourism can be traced back to a multitude of problems plaguing the industry like vagaries of weather and labour unrest resulting in shrinking economy. Realising the tremendous potential of plantation tourism, many heritage and plantation bungalows, quaint homestays and high-end resorts have opened up with plantation tours being the biggest attraction.ADVERTISEMENTBesides being a revenue-earning drive in South India, it has generated local employment earning foreign currency and improved the existing scenario of the place.  It has also created a general awareness among the people about good tea, coffee, rubber and spices. Cardamom Hills Reserve, KeralaStraddling Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Thekkady and the plantation town of Kumily are convenient bases to explore the picturesque Cardamom Hills with rolling estates of tea, coffee, vanilla, cardamom and pepper, interspersed with forests and game reserves. As you stroll the streets of the plantation town of Kumily, you will find the air heady with the scent of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom.From a spice heartland, Kumily has metamorphosed to a bustling tourist centre and the tourist industry has replaced the spice trade as the main source of income for the local populace. One unmissable experience in Cardamom Hill Reserve is the weekly cardamom auctions at centres like Kumily and Vandamedu. Of the 20 cardamom auction centres in the world, 12 are in the Cardamom Hill Reserve area and at one time, Vandanmedu used to be the world’s largest cardamom auction centre. After the wildlife viewing, plantation visit and sightseeing in Kumily, you can discover an array of walks, drives, views and adventure, before you head to Munnar.As one enters the tea town of Munnar, the rolling greens of manicured tea bushes herald a green carpet welcome and the fragrance of the tea rules the senses. Munnar has other claims to fame apart from its ubiquitous tea plantations, craggy peaks, sprightly waterfalls, placid lakes, picture postcard views and undulating valleys of verdant greenery. It is in close proximity to a host of attractions like Kolukkumalai, world’s highest tea estate, Marayoor, world’s best sandalwood forest, Anaimudi, the highest peak south of the Himalayas and India’s first Tea Museum. For a walk on the wild side, visit Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary and the Eravikulam National Park sheltering the endangered Nilgiri Tahr and the exotic ‘Neelakurinji’ plant which covers the hills in a blue mantle once in 12 years.From a plantation town, Munnar has currently metamorphosed to a flamboyant hill station, a booming centre of business and tourism. A stay in a heritage or tea bungalow combined with a visit to the tea garden in Munnar, is an enriching experience.

What gives Kolukkumalai tea a special flavour is presumably the high altitude. From Munnar, Kolukkumalai estate is a two-hour jeep drive up to the top past the plantations through a narrow treacherous track. There is also a bridal path which was once used by estate workers to ferry tea chests to the plains and provision back to the top.What makes Kolukkumalai Tea Factory quaint is that they still use machinery which was made in Ireland and firewood is used to dry the leaves, not electricity. The orthodox method of tea processing is used and not the crush-tear-curl method which is an automated process of making tea. The orthodox tea making is a seven-step process- withering, rolling, sieving, fermenting, drying, fibre extraction and grading. The two-storeyed factory which was built in 1930 by the British still retains its original wooden panelling, staircases, flooring, rafters and machinery. After a guided tour of the tea factory, ensure to taste the piping hot tea.<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2FA%20perennial%20stream%20in%20a%20tea%20plantation.JPG?w=1200" alt="A perennial stream in a tea plantation"/>A perennial stream in a tea plantationTea county of ValparaiThe British planters stomped their colonial footprints in the tea district of Valparai in the early 1900s.

As you drive through the sprawling tea gardens in the lap of the Anamalai range of the Western Ghats, or on the scenic road trip along the backwaters of the Sholayar Dam and Malakkapara you’ll be treated to herds of elephants and massive gaurs grazing casually among the tea bushes.The best way to chill out is in the stately Sinna Dorai Bungalow, a refurbished heritage bungalow, perched atop the Iyerpadi Hill, surrounded by tea fields commanding a stupendous view of the Valparai landscape and the rain forests, in the Anammali Tiger Reserve.

Chikmagalur, KarnatakaTucked away in the Sahyadri hills of mid-Western Karnataka, Chikmagalur is at the very heart of coffee country.
