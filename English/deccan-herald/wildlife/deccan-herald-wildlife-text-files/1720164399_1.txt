The Tourism department’s move to promote tourism may have provided a booster dose to the economy in the region. 

ADVERTISEMENTBut it appears to have come at the cost of the wildlife. The homestays and resorts mushrooming in the forest areas, as part of the initiative, seem to have scared the wild animals away from their habitats.

Eco-tourism was chosen over big projects, in the hope that it would generate huge employment opportunities to people in Uttara Kannada district, without harming the ecology.  

One could easily sight bisons, deer, stags, wild boars, leopards, tigers, rabbits, wild dogs and other animals, besides a number of birds in the Dandeli wildlife sanctuary (spread over an area of 470 sq km) not long ago. But such sightings are becoming rarer with increasing human activity in the forest. 

The higher tourist flow and the increasing number of vehicles plying in the forest seem to have made things difficult for the beings in the forest, much to the chagrin of wildlife enthusiasts. 

Hornbills used to throng the Kali river near Ganeshagudi, but their numbers are dwindling on the river banks. A total of 30 resorts and homestays have come up at Dandeli in Haliyal taluk and in and around Joida taluk, since 2005. 

To add to the worries of the greens is the trend by the resorts to hunt down the animals and serve their meat to the tourists. Some of the tourists also indulge in the hunting of the animals as a pastime. Indiscriminate hunting has led to a fall in the numbers of the stags and rabbits in the forest.

Locals in the Dandeli forest said the wild animals were migrating from their habitat, as the resorts and homestays are too close for comfort. Forest officials said on condition of anonymity that they could not check poaching effectively due to shortage of staff and other infrastructure. 

“We cannot keep a check on each and every tourist, particularly when there is a huge rush of tourists during vacations,” they said.
