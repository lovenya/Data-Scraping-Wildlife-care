Random urbanisation has a direct impact on biodiversity, reminded writer Poornachandra Tejaswi’s wife Rajeshwari Tejaswi.

ADVERTISEMENT“As a result of such blind development, many animals in the Malnad region have reached the brink of extinction,” she rued, speaking at the launch of ‘Hakki Pukka’ the website on birds, at the Poornachandra Tejaswi Biodiversity Centre at Kottigehara in the taluk on Saturday, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Tejaswi.

Rajeshwari stressed on the fact that protection of wildlife was the need of the hour. Lauding the efforts of Vismaya Pratishthana in developing the website, she said that the newly-launched site introduced the birds of the Malnad region to the entire world. She also hoped that the research centre will carry out several more such endeavours in future.

‘Hakki Pukka’ website developer Mahesh said that there was a lack of information Kannada about birds. “The website was developed to provide such information to the local people also, in the local language. Introduction to 1,260 birds has been provided on the website and complete details on 250 birds have been uploaded so far. Details on birds of the world will be put up on the site,” he explained.

Bangalore Agricultural University Professor Dr A K Chakravarthi said that there are more than 10,000 birds in the world and more than 70 species were found in the Malnad region. Speaking on the man-animal conflict, he said, “Wild animals have been intruding human localities as their natural habitats are being destroyed. Also, the animals have been facing scarcity of food in forests. The problem has to be solved in the present stage, to prevent further damage,” he warned.
