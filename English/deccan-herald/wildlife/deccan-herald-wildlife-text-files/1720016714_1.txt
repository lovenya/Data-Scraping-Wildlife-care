The festival was punctuated by screams of delight and whistles from children. Accompanied by their parents, they were all cheering for their favourite jumbo.The camp was organised to create an awareness among the public about the need for conservation of wildlife and forests, apart from entertaining them.

However, it was all worth it because elephants did not disappoint them, for they ran, played soccer and performed various tricks as per the commands of their mahouts. They took part in nearly 16 entertainment games. 

As per the commands of their mahouts, they were seen sleeping in the middle, reverse walking, running, walking together by holding each other’s ears, walking by holding each other’s trunks, playing football. Children along with their parents were given a chance to bathe the tuskers.

 Children were seen feeding the tuskers with sugarcane, jaggery, coconut, banana, ‘Ragimudde’etc. Elephants Parashurama (7), Shivagange (9), Ranjan (12), Mayur (22), Gopi (29) played football with the help of Elephant Vijaya (50).
