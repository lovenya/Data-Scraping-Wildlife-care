A traveller’s bungalow constructed during the time of the British at Boodhipadaga in BRT reserve forest was a favourite spot for the erstwhile Mysore kings.

ADVERTISEMENTThe bungalow situated in the lap of nature, was where the Wadiyars stayed during their visits to forests for hunting.

According to close associates of Chaduranga Kantharaj Urs, who is touted as the next royal scion of Mysore, he had stayed in the bungalow overnight about four years ago. He had purchased a new Gypsy vehicle in which he visited Boodhipadaga. He had left the vehicle parked in front of the bungalow during the night, and a herd of jumbos which passed through the region is said to have damaged the vehicle beyond recognition.

However instead of being upset, his love for the animals only grew, his friends recall.
He is also said to be a multi-faceted personality and has great interest in wildlife. He used to spend his leisure time in forests and said to be a keen bird watcher.

Urs is the president of the association ‘Namma Sangha’ for the past two years.
The association has been striving to create awareness among the residents to conserve forest resources. Accordingly, about 33,000 families have been provided LPG cylinders, which has been successful in reducing the forest dependency by 85 per cent.

 Popular wildlife photojournalists Krupakar-Senani are the founders of the association. It has international sports teams, politicians, environmentalists, students and advocates as its members. The association has also provided financial support to 13 students who are pursuing vocational studies.

Urs is also widely travelled. He was also elected as the president of Mysore Race Club. Graduating in Law and Journalism he has interests in politics too. He has great interest in English classical music and has learnt to play the piano. He is said to be a fan of Kannada matinee idol Dr Rajkumar.
