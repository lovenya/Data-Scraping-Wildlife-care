Sublime Galleria, UB City is presenting ‘The World Through My Eyes’, a unique blend of photography and art by Ranga ‘Vinay’ Voona.

A self-taught artist, Ranga is an aerospace engineer by profession and has conducted a number of photo-shoots at international auto shows. He is inspired by nature and wildlife, and specialises in recreating his own photography into works of art using digital editing — giving it the appearance of oil on a canvas. 

His unique style has earned him many accolades, including special recognition at the prestigious Upstream People Gallery in the US. The curator and art professor at the gallery described his unconventional adaptations as something that ‘brightens up the situation’. He creates artistic pieces by seamlessly combining photography with art. He creates these pieces through photographic processes and eclectic editing. Some of his varied works have been displayed at international art and photography exhibitions. 

The works will be showcased till May 2, Monday to Saturday, from 11 am to 8 pm. 

Commenting on the occasion, Ranga said, “It gives me immense pleasure to share my latest series, ‘The World Through My Eyes’. I am fascinated with the combination of photography and art, and particularly enjoy landscapes and wildlife photography.”
