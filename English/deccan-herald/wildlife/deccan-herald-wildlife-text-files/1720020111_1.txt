The decision will be a major relief to farmers in several districts where the Ganga and Gandak basin exists. After all, these farmers were facing huge losses as wheat, maize, vegetables and pulses were damaged by herds of nilgais. These animals not only grazed in farmlands but also damaged standing crops. The government has appointed the DMs and SDOs as the honorary wildlife wardens of their districts. These officials will be authorised to identify the area facing maximum threat of blue bulls to human lives and property and pass written orders for culling the hazardous antelopes ‘when there is no alternative left.’

The selective killings would continue till the end of this year. The DMs and the SDOs have been asked to make arrangements for the cremation of blue bulls and send a report to the chief wildlife warden. 

The government’s directive has been issued after the Patna High Court asked the Centre to shift 25,000 blue bulls from Bihar’s 15 districts to forest reserve. Such was the menace of nilgais that the matter was raised even before Chief Minister Nitish Kumar when he undertook Vishwas Yatra and visited rural hinterland last year. Farmers in droves narrated to him their plight.ADVERTISEMENT
