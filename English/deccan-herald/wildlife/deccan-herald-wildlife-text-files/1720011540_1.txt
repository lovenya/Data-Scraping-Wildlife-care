ADVERTISEMENTThis has come as a shot in the arm for many green groups who have been demanding the government to protect the forests of Bhimgad.

There are some stretches of the Western Ghats that simply take your breath away. The Mahadayi valley in Belgaum district is one such area. The Bhimgad forest is part of the valley. 

Ever since 1992, naturalists have focused on the ecologically sensitive Mahadayi and Bhimgad biospheres and have sought to protect the region from encroachers and the poaching mafia. In 1998, the then principal chief conservator of forests had sent a proposal seeking wild life sanctuary status to the Bhimgad forest. 

Incidentally, the Mahadayi river area is connected to Bhimgad forest. The river originates in Khanapur of Belgaum and flows as Mandovi in Goa. Most of the primary forest cover in the Bhimgad area was depleted during the British period and today, very few areas in patches remain, as evergreen forest. 

Rampant tree felling
During the British Raj and thereafter, up till 1980, felling of trees continued. Nobody seemed to be taking interest to protect these ecologically sensitive forests which harbour rare and endangered wildlife. Evergreen forests began to disappear giving way to moist deciduous forestsÂ  in many parts of the Mahadayi valley. 
Realising the decrease in wildlife and forest cover, some of the environmental groups started awareness programmes and a movement to protect the <img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2F2010%2F03%2F01%2Fspec-bhim-gad-hill-200.jpg?w=1200" alt=""/>Bhimgad forest. 
The forest department is also involved in creating awareness about the importance of wildlife and has set up many anti-poaching camps in this region. Smuggling of rare and medicinal plants called Saptarangi in local parlance was curbed by environmental groups. 

Caves in Bhimgad
For a long time, the Barapedi caves in the Bhimgad forest area was thought to be the only place for wroughtons free-tailed bats (Otomophs wroughtonii). 
But later, the free tailed bats were spotted in various caves in the evergreen forests of Joida taluk in the Western Ghats of Karwar district. The laterite and rocky caves in the Dandeli wild life sanctuary are also home to these bats.
