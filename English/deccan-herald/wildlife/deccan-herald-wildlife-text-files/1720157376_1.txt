Cricketer Anil Kumble and actress Aindrita Ray joined hands for this cause along with the Green Matrix Organisation and Samhita Academy taking the message of conservation across the State.

Anil Kumble, an ardent animal lover and vice-chairman, State Board for Wildlife, has taken a personal interest in the cause and has been touring all the zoos in the State to create awareness among the public. 

He has already visited Mysore Zoo and adopted a giraffe calf. 

“The Bannerghatta Biological Park hosts many endangered species which are at risk of being extinct. The shrinking wildlife is a serious issue and there is an urgent need to create awareness in this regard. In my view, there is no better way than engaging young minds and children. I appeal to everyone to contribute their best for the nature and adopting animals will be one of the easiest and effective ways in this regard,” he says. 

Anil Kumble was interested in adopting King Cobra, but as he had donated a bigger amount, it would be utilised to take care of other animals as well. 

On the occasion, he also gave away adoption certificates to people. 

The Jayaram couple adopted one of the animals, collected the certificate and said they wished to do more to save biodiversity. 

“Two months back when we first visited the park, I was not into any conservation schemes. But I was moved by the shrinking wildlife and the plight of animals. After that, we decided to quit our non-vegetarian food habits and became pure vegetarians. On Sundays, when I have leisure time, I will come here and volunteer for the cause of animal protection,” he says. 

Anil Kumble and Aindrita Ray had a grand safari with the children and enjoyed the wildlife. 

Kumble, who is known for his wildlife photography, captured the tigers and lions on the camera. 

After the safari, a thrilled Aindrita expressed her wish to adopt a tiger. 
“I am a huge animal lover and animal welfare is a cause dear to my heart. After going through the list, I will definitely adopt one, most probably a tiger,” she said.

Every child present over there took home the message of conservation and care for animals. 

They were already done with their selection and hoped to come back with the parents for the adoption process. 

Those who are interested can select their favourite animal. 

The adoption rate ranges from Rs 750 to Rs 1,75,000 per annum and you can contribute to feeding and caring of the selected animals for one year or more.
