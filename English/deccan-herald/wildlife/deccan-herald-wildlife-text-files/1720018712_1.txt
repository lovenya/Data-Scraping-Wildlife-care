There is a need to conserve these species and especially save them from poachers and tree smugglers,” he said.

The State government has released Rs 43 lakh for the development and management of the Shivram Karanth Biological Park under the Pilikula Nisargadhama Society. The proposal to have hippopotamus and bison in the park has been accepted by the government, he added.

Speaking on the occasion, Western Ghats Task Force Chairman Ananth Hedge Ashisara said that there is a need to hold a huge protest just like the way Anna Hazare did to save the species of Western Ghats. 

“It is not sufficient to look after the endangered species in sanctuaries. There is a need to safeguard the species in Western Ghats. Today, the natural resources in the Western Ghat areas are destroyed in the name of development and killing of animals is also on high. One can not expect the government to take the entire responsibility. There is also a shortage of forest officers. It would be ideal if citizens would also extend their support,” he said.

The conflict between human beings and animals are on a rise. As human beings are encroaching the forest land, there is lack of space for animals to live. Hence, there is a need to create awareness, he said.

The guest house, bird aviary, animal in-patient ward was also inaugurated on the occasion. 

Photography expo
A photography expo was the highlight of the programme. Reputed photographers like Dr Akther Hussain, Yermal, Subash, Murali, Shankar had displayed their collection of photographs on the theme wildlife.

Drawing and quiz competition was held for school children on the occasion. The programme was presided by Moodbidri MLA Abhay Chandra Jain. Karnataka Legislative Assembly Deputy Speaker N Yogish Bhat, Deputy Commissioner Dr N S Channappa Gowda and others were present on the occasion.

New guests at Pilikula 
Golden Pheasants, Ring-Necked Pheasants and Lady Amherst Pheasants are the new bird species introduced at the Biological Park. Speaking on the sidelines of the programme, Shivram Karanth Biological Park Director H G Bhandary said that the three pairs of pheasants have been imported from China and another three pairs are expected to arrive soon.

The bison and hippopotamus will arrive in the park within a span of 15 days. It has been decided to get them from Mysore or Bhandipur. There has been a delay due to Mysore Dasara but the arrangements for these animals in the park have been made. There are plans to have an enclosure for water birds and extend the snake block, he added.
