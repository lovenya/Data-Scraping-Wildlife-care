It was immobilized before the trap was removed.Besides cuts and bruises on its left fore-limb, the bear was also bleeding from the mouth as he gnawed on the barbed wire. The animal was kept under observation for a few hours after the treatment, said Wildlife SOS' director of veterinary operations Dr Arun A Sha.Chikkanayakahalli Range Forest Officer Laxminarayanappa said authorities would create awareness among local villagers to co-exist with wildlife from the neighbouring forest area.
