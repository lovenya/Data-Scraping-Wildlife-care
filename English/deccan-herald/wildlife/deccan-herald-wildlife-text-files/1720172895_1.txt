"According to the Forest department, the tigress had claimed 13 to 14 lives (in that area) and hence they had to take the decision (of shooting it). There are some reports that the tigress was shot and then the dart (was inserted)....this aspect would be probed...we will look into the procedural lapses," he said.Fadnavis, however, said that the briefing reports with him states that dart was used first to sedate her, but she attacked the team, and the Forest department team had to open fire.When his attention was drawn that while shikari and sharpshooter Shafath Ali Khan of Hyderabad was hired by the Forest department, his son Asghar Ali opened the fire, he said: "Doubts have been raised and we would verify it."ALSO READCelebrities slam Maharashtra govt over Avni's killingAvni killing a straight case of crime: Maneka GandhiFadnavis said that a tiger is a "gentleman" and does not attack humans unless the humans encroach or violate their area.
