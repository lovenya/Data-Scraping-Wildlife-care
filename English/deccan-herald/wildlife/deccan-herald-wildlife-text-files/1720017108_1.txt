Speaking at the inauguration of a centralised control room at Aranya Bhavan in Malleswaram on Monday, Forest Minister C H Vijayashankar said the man-animal conflicts, which had mainly increased in Hassan district, had resulted in the Forest Department trying to bring out an action plan in coordination with the Centre.

The recent deaths of three elephant calves in Hassan district have brought to fore the severity of the conflict, where land holders are increasingly resorting to putting up electric fences to discourage elephants from entering their fields. 

However no attempt has been made by the Forest Department to recover hundreds of acres of forest land which have been encroached by land owners or prevent widespread deforestation occurring due to varied reasons.

The Minister announced that the Department would now be providing wireless radios to all its staff working in the forest areas. This move to provide wireless sets has come about after a hiatus of 25 years.

On being asked about the increase in the amount of entry fee at Bannerghatta Biological Park, the Minister said, “This is not a profit making venture, but a move taken considering the financial constraints.”

Strongly defending the move, Principal Secretary, Forest, Ecology and Environment Kaushik Mukherjee said it would discourage more visitors, especially at tiger reserves and prevent them from considering a ‘picnic place.’
