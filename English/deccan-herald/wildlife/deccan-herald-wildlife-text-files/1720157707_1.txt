A survey at Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary has revealed that the reserve, spread over 8 sq km, hosts 115 bird species, including those who migrate here from far off places.

Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN), an initiative of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), conducted the survey at the protected forest land, 40 km from here, last month in collaboration with the state Forest Department.

"The count, which revealed presence of 115 species, included migratory birds like black mapped oriole, greenish warbler and forest wag tail," Parag Rangnekar, an IBCN volunteer, told PTI.

The sanctuary also houses a mini zoo, which is being renovated at a cost of Rs 20 crore.
Volunteers have noted an increase in the presence of grey jungle fowl, threatened by hunting for food and habitat loss.

Rangnekar said IBCN had taken up the survey for the first time in Goa to "ascertain the exact number of bird species and their trend in the state's wild".
Volunteers will regularly collect data over the years to keep a track of varieties and change in patterns, he said.ADVERTISEMENT
