The shifting of Atal Behari Vajpayee Zoo (ABVZ) from Bellary to the pristine forests of Kamalapura adjoining Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary near the historic town of Hampi has hit a roadblock, with two Bellary-based wildlife enthusiasts — Santosh Martin and Rajesh M Kurpad — filing a public interest litigation against it in the High Court.

ADVERTISEMENTThe PIL has challenged the constitutional validity of a circular dated November 13, 2007, issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, stating that activities required to be done in a zoo as per the approved management plan would not attract the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, provided that such activities were necessary for the management of animals and imparting education.

The petition also challenged a government order dated November 20, 2010, which authorised the shifting of ABVZ from Bellary, and the tenders called by the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary, for works to shift the zoo.

Contending that the respondent, Forest Department, did not obtain permission from the Supreme Court as required by the apex court direction, the petitioners said the proposed zoo could not be built unless the Central government did an environment impact assessment, in accordance with the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and “the project is likely to have an adverse effect on biological diversity,” the petition said.

Further stating that the proposed zoo falls within the eco-sensitive zone of the Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary — which hosts the endangered sloth bear — the petitioners said the very purpose of the sanctuary would be defeated if the zoo was shifted there.
