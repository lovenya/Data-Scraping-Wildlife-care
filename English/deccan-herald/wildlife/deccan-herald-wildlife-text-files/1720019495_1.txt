The deputy commissioner has permitted the company to use dynamite to blast boulders in violation of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, endangering the rich flora and fauna of the region.

The compnay has been allowed to set up two mini hydel power projects in an area of 8.21 hectares on survey number 16 of Kenchanakumari  and survey number 1 of Kaginahare  in the reserve rainforest area.

The thick rainforest of the Western Ghats is an abode of diverse wildlife. According to the Wildlife Act Schedule 1, Column 2 entry into the forest is illegal. Environment and Forest Minister C P Yogeeshwara, who inspected the place where the work on hydel project is in progress last week, said he wondered how permission was accorded to a hydel project in a reserved forest areaAnil Kumble, vice-chairman of the State Wildlife Board , during his visit to the project site on June 13 had termed the use of dynamite for blasting a grave violation. 

The Board wrote to the district administration stating that prior permission from  National and State Wildlife Boards is required to allow any activity in the reserve forest. It has also sought legal action against the company for violation of the Wildlife Act.
On the direction of the Board, the district administration ordered the company not to use dynamite for blasting.

Clean chit
On July 28, Deputy Conservator of Forests Chandregowda wrote to the deputy commissioner that there was no violation of the Wildlife Act by the company and the project did not endanger the  wildlife.

The deputy commissioner has permitted minimal use of dynamite for blasting. However, it is common knowledge here that the blasts can be heard at least four kilometres from the point of the blast. 

The blasts have caused fear among animals. For the construction of a tunnel, the company has  triggered thousands of blasts over the last one year. To make the dynamites, a team has been camping in the forest for the past one year.

The use of gigantic machinery, generators, excavators and the plying of tippers, trucks and jeeps have been causing disturbance to the wildlife.

Malnad Janapara Horata Samithi president H A Kishore Kumar has demanded an inquiry into the clean chit for the project given by the Deputy Conservator of Forests. 
As the Environment and Forest Minister himself has admitted that this project is detrimental to the forest and wildlife, the ball is now in the government’s court.
