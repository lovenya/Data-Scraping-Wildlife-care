Wise messenger 

One would imagine that Imran Khan has his hands full with a film that’s slated for release early next month. But it turns out the actor’s taking time out of his hectic schedule to play peacemaker to bereaved young friends. If the latest episode of ‘Superstar Santa’ is anything to go by, Imran has stepped into the shoes of Santa only to help Varsha resolve issues with long time friend Praveen.

Varsha and Praveen have been best friends for over five years now. Praveen has stood by her in the toughest of times. 

However, their friendship has been under a little strain of late on account of Praveen’s constant pestering for marriage and taking the friendship to the next level. Praveen, according to Varsha, wants more out of their relationship and is of the opinion that a boy and girl cannot be ‘just friends’. 

Varsha begs to differ. She regards him as her best friend, no more, no less. 

Wanting to voice out her feelings to Praveen, Varsha seeks Imran’s help in ending this confusion. 
The actor gets Varsha and Praveen to confront each other and pour their hearts out.  Will Imran be able to solve Varsha’s woes? Will he be able to get Praveen understand Varsha’s state of mind without straining their friendship? To find out, tune in to ‘Superstar Santa’ on February 5 at 7 pm on UTV Stars.
