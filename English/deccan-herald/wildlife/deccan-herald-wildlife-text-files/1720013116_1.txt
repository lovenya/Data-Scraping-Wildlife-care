Thousand of people on tractors, bullock carts and camels from nearby Guna, Bina, Shivpuri in MP and Rajasthan converge here. The pilgrims enter from various gates to take a holy dip in the Lakshman, Sita, Luv-Kush and Suraj Kunds and offering  prayers on the occasion. The Saharia marriage function (Swayamvar) in typically rural style is special. A Sahariya boy drops a handkerchief for proposing to a Saharia damsel and the acceptance of the rumaal by kissing it is considered as a consent from the girl for marriage. The bride and grooms take the seven rounds of the Barnawa tree and after the blessings of the parents are accepted as a married couple.  

Various communities visit Sitabari to bathe in the tanka which are always filled with clean fresh water considered to be sacred and is believed to possess many curative properties. 
Baran is well connected with all the major cities of Rajasthan and is 72 kms from Kota. The famous Saharia dominated place has other attractions like Bhand Devra (mini Khajuraho), Kakoni, Shergarh Fort, Sorsan Wildlife Protected area for the Great Indian Bustard, Shahbad Masjid and other places to see. Dolmela, Phuldol folk festival, Brahmni Mataji Mela are also big attractions for the tourist.
