Early this month, Dhoni came to Dehradun as part of "Save Tigers" campaign. Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank had then announced his nomination as the honorary wildlife warden of the state but the government did not issue the mandatory notification. "A notification regarding appointment of Dhoni as chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand would be issued in a day or two as we have already received approval from the Chief Minister in this regard," Additional Secretary, Forest, Sushant Patnaik said.

Meanwhile, the government is yet to grant extension to Brijendra Singh who has been the Wildlife Warden of the Jim Corbett National Park for the past four decades.
Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has, in a letter to Nishank, favoured reappointment of Singh.

"He is involved with Corbett for over 40 years and is perhaps the most knowledgeable person on Corbett," Ramesh said. State BJP President Bishan Singh Chufal had also urged the Chief Minister to extend Singh's tenure.ADVERTISEMENT
