A large spotted deer, apparently chased by a leopard, ran for its life and in the darkness crashed into a tiny hutment in Mumbai on Sunday.ADVERTISEMENTThe incident took place in the Hanuman Tekdi hutments off the IIT-Bombay campus that is located in the outer circle of Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai.The house belongs to Sunita Singh.For the family, it was like a bolt form the blue. But they regained composure and along with some neighbours made a call to the forest department.The uninvited guest too maintained calm.“They made an SOS call to the forest department,” said Wildlife Warden Pawan Sharma.“I am calling from Powai, there is a deer has fallen inside my neighbour’s house, we need help,” was the distress call.Despite the lockdown, the forest department’s Mumbai Range immediately started a seven-member rescue operation along with Sharma’s RAWW, to save the large herbivore.The rescue team managed to reach the home, trap the deer and shift it in a wildlife ambulance.“It was immediately taken to Sanjay Gandhi National Park’s Rescue Centre for further medical examination and rehabilitation,” Sharma said later.The tenement dwellers, who were sleeping barely a couple of feet away from where it fell, were unhurt. There was no damage to household articles like the fan, TV, gas, cupboards, bed, etc.
