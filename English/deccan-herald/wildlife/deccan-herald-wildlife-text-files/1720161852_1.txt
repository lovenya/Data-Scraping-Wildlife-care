Police arrested a young boy for illegally entering an enclosure in Nehru Zoological Park and taking a picture of him standing on a rare Galapagos tortoise. 

ADVERTISEMENTMohammad Abdul alias Fazal, a mechanic in an auto garage, had a series of pictures of him taken by a friend in May last year, which he posted subsequently on his Facebook page. 

In one of them, he was seen standing over an aging tortoise and another showed him getting closer to an ostrich. 

The pictures that went viral caught the attention of a few animal lovers who complained to the zoo’s curator.

"It is surprising that there are people in the background of the photo where he was standing on the hapless tortoise, but no one seems to care" Curator G Ramakrishna Rao said. 

He said since the park is too large, it would be impossible for the 90-member security team to keep an eye on each enclosure and what the visitors do. 

"He is a habitual offender and has been entering the enclosures of rare animals and taking photographs on different days,” Bahadurpura Station Inspector Harish Kaushik said. 

The boy had claimed that he posted pictures of him with the rare animals to get more Facebook likes. 

Abdul was booked on the charge of trespass under relevant Indian Penal Code section and provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, Kaushik added. 

Ironically, a few vernaculars and an English daily have also published Abdul’s pictures.  
Trespassing is nothing new to the zoo here.  In 2009, a man in an inebriated condition was rescued with injuries to his arm after he tried feeding grass to a white tiger. 

In 2000, some persons entered the safari from the Miralam Tank side, killed a tigress Sakhi and skinned the animal. 

Mohd Salahuddin, a property offender, was arrested for his involvement in the case five years later.
