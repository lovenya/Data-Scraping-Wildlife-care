Green tea also helps you lose weight around your waist. Its main antioxidant, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is known for helping with natural weight loss.Green tea that you drink from a cup and green tea extract that is in SupplementWeight Loss have the same effects on your body. They can make your metabolism better.How It Works:Many experts think that green tea extract helps to activate norepinephrine in your body. Norepinephrine is a natural hormone that acts as a nerve signal and a stress hormone. It makes fat cells release fatty acids into the blood. This helps to reduce fat.The Side Effects:Most people can take green tea extract without any problems. But some people who are sensitive to caffeine might have some side effects because green tea has some caffeine in it.Green Coffee Bean Extract If you are like most people who drink coffee every day, you drink it in the morning and maybe all day long. Your morning coffee has ground, roasted and brewed coffee beans that have about 100 milligrams of caffeine. The caffeine gives you energy and helps you burn fat, but roasted coffee beans don’t have one important thing that can help with weight loss: chlorogenic acid. This is what you find in green coffee bean extracts."Green coffee beans and caffeine can help you lose weight and control your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure.How they work:Caffeine makes your metabolism faster, which helps you burn more calories and fat. The green coffee beans also have chlorogenic acid, which can stop your body from absorbing too many carbs from the food you eat.How they affect your body:Some people may feel dizzy, nervous, or anxious because of the caffeine in the green coffee beans. Some may also have stomach problems or diarrhea because of the chlorogenic acid. If you are sensitive to caffeine or green coffee beans, you should be careful with diet pills that have them.Garcinia Cambogia Garcinia Cambogia comes from a tropical fruit in Indonesia. Many diet pills have it because it can help you lose weight and stop making new fat cells. The diet pill makers say that the hydroxycitric acid in the fruit can make you feel less hungry, eat less, burn fat, and lower your blood sugar.Some studies have shown that Garcinia Cambogia pills can help you lose weight and reduce body fat. This is because the hydroxycitric acid can turn fat cells into energy that can make you perform better. It can also stop your body from making more fat by blocking an enzyme called citrate lyase.The side effects:Most people can take up to 2,800 milligrams of Garcinia Cambogia without any problems, but some may have headaches, stomach issues, or rashes after using it.Bitter Orange Many diet pills have bitter orange. It is a citrus fruit that has a chemical called synephrine. Synephrine is similar to ephedrine, which was a banned ingredient in many weight loss pills. How it works:Bitter orange can help you lose weight in different ways, such as making your metabolism faster, breaking down fats, and making you feel less hungry. It can help you eat fewer calories and burn more fat for faster results.The side effects:Some studies have shown that bitter orange can help you lose weight if you take it for a short time, but synephrine is a strong stimulant. It can cause serious problems, such as making your heart beat faster and raising your blood pressure. Bitter orange can also interact with some medicines. You should talk to your doctor before taking it. Chromium Picolinate Chromium is a mineral that you can find in whole grains, lean meats, and vegetables (like potatoes and broccoli). Your body does not need much chromium to work well, but some people may not get enough chromium from their diets.Low chromium levels can make it harder for your body to use food for energy. If you take enough chromium from diet pills, it can help you control your blood sugar levels and build more muscle."What It Does:Chromium helps insulin work better and turns carbs, proteins and fats into energy. Some people think that chromium in SupplementWeight Loss can make you less hungry, burn more fat and lose body fat.The Risks:Your body only needs a little bit of chromium to function, so taking too much can cause trouble sleeping, headaches, moodiness and difficulty focusing. If you have kidney problems, you should avoid natural diet pills that have chromium in them.Raspberry Ketone Raspberry ketones are natural chemicals that give fruits like raspberries, cranberries, blackberries and kiwis their smell. They became popular when scientists found out that they help break down fat and control metabolism and blood sugar levels in mice.What It Does:Raspberry ketones can help you slim down in two different ways. First, they can make fat break down faster at the cell level. This makes it easier for norepinephrine, a hormone that burns fat, to use it. Second, raspberry ketones increase the production of adiponectin, a hormone made by fat cells. Adiponectin can help you manage your glucose and metabolism levels.Read Also:National Association of School PsychologistsNational Archery in the Schools Program (NASP)NASP Center - National Association of School PsychologistsNASP Overview — Texas Parks & Wildlife DepartmentNational Association of School Psychologists (@nasponline) / TwitterThe Risks:Raspberry ketones do not have any known bad effects. While some users feel nervous, high blood pressure, or fast heart rate, most people can take raspberry ketones without any negative side effects.L-Carnitine Your body makes L-carnitine, a chemical that is similar to amino acids. It is made from methionine and lysine. The natural chemical helps move fatty acids into your cells. Cells then use the fat to make energy. So, you will stay alert, focused and ready for the day.Researchers think that we need more studies to show how well L-carnitine works as a weight loss supplement. But, L-carnitine can help reduce the physical and mental tiredness that some people feel when they are losing weight. What It Does:L-carnitine carries fatty acids into mitochondria in your cells. The mitochondria use the fatty acids for fuel, which helps the body burn fat.The Risks:Although a few users report side effects when they take SupplementWeight Loss that have L-carnitine, some get nausea or diarrhoea.Caffeine Most SupplementWeight Loss have some kind of caffeine, such as caffeine anhydrous, green tea extract or green coffee bean extract. Many people think that caffeine is linked to weight loss, but few people know what caffeine does to help you lose weight.Whether you drink it in a cup of coffee or take one of the best fat loss pills, caffeine can help you lose weight by making you less hungry for a short time and boosting your body’s calorie and fat burning processes."What It Does:Caffeine makes your body burn more fat by raising your body’s heat. This helps you use up more calories, speed up your metabolism, and lose weight.How It Affects Your Body:Most adults can have 400 milligrams or more of caffeine a day without any problems, but some people who are very sensitive to caffeine might need to take SupplementWeight Loss without any stimulants. Having too much caffeine for some people could cause stomach upset and loose stools, as well as trouble sleeping, high blood pressure and nervousness.Conjugated Linoleic Acid The natural weight-loss pills have conjugated linoleic acid - also called CLA for short. The healthy trans-fat is found naturally in the foods that come from grass-fed animals like deer and cows. They include butter, meat or cheese. Many studies have shown that CLA can help with losing weight and burning fat. CLA may also help you feel less hungry and eat less calories.What It Does:CLA can lower your hunger and boost your metabolism, leading to more fat-burning and calorie-burning activity. In the end, people who use diet pills that have CLA might see a small improvement in weight loss.The Side Effects:Using CLA for a short time can help with fat loss, but using it for a long time could cause bad side effects, such as fatty liver, insulin resistance and stomach pain.Some Prescription Weight Loss Drugs to Think About
	
	Orlistat (Alli) If you are an adult and have a BMI of 25 or higher, your doctor may suggest the generic version of Orlistat which is also called Alli to help you lose weight. This strong weight loss drug helps to reduce how much fat your body takes in after a meal. In turn, Alli could be a good choice for people who follow diets that are low in fat and calories.
	
Orlistat is one of the ingredients in Alli that stops lipase which is an enzyme that breaks down fats in your body’s intestines. While Orlistat can lower the amount of fat that your body uses and stores, it may also prevent your body from getting fat-soluble vitamins, such as Vitamin A, D, E and K. That’s why you should take Alli under medical guidance. Although the FDA has approved Alli and Orlistat for use in adults, the prescription drugs may cause unpleasant side effects, such as gas and soft or oily stool and stomach pain.
	
	Contrast: Made together with Currax Pharmaceuticals, Contrave helps reduce cravings and make you feel less hungry. Contrave is a drug for SupplementWeight Loss that has naltrexone which is an FDA-approved drug used to treat addiction, with bupropion, a prescription antidepressant to help with weight loss for people who meet certain criteria which include:
	
A BMI of 30 or more (obese) A BMI of 27 or more (overweight) with another related condition like high cholesterol or diabetes The side effects of the weight loss drug can include nausea, dizziness and sadness because of bupropion’s use."
	
	Phentermine: Phentermine is a drug that acts like a stimulant and helps you lose weight faster. Phentermine works on your brain and nervous system and makes your heart beat faster and your appetite smaller. This means you feel less hungry, eat less and burn more fat.
	
Phentermine does this by making your brain release more chemicals that control your hunger and how your body uses fat. It can also make you more active and energetic. The side effects are feeling dizzy, nervous, having headaches and diarrhea.
	
	Belviq (Lorcaserin) Belviq is a drug that helps you control your hunger by changing the messages that your brain gets from hormones. These hormones tell your body when you are full after eating a meal. They can help you prevent weight gain, lower your calorie intake and lose more weight than just dieting and exercising alone.
	
Belviq cannot cure other health problems like heart disease or high cholesterol, but it can make you slimmer. Some people who take Belviq may have some bad effects, like an irregular heartbeat, stomach pain or seizures.
	
	Xenical Xenical is a stronger version of Alli, a drug that uses Orlistat to block some of the fat from your food from being absorbed by your body. Xenical has 120 milligrams of Orlistat, while Alli has 60 milligrams. Xenical can help you get rid of up to 30 percent of the fat in your diet.
	
Both drugs work the same way and remove the extra fat from your body. Studies have also shown that taking Xenical with a low-fat and low-calorie diet can improve your results. The side effects can include stomach pain, gas, low vitamin D levels and loose or oily stools.Things to Consider When Buying Weight Loss Supplements Whether you choose to buy a diet supplement from the store or get a prescription from your doctor, finding the best SupplementWeight Loss for you can be hard.Only you or your doctor can decide which Supplement Weight Loss is right for your needs, but you can narrow down your options by comparing each product on five important factors: Ingredients Even natural ingredients can cause bad reactions, but many people prefer diet supplements made from natural ingredients, instead of artificial chemicals or processed fat burners.
