From Malaysia’s Penang to Hiroshima Peace Memorial in Japan and Hampi in Karnataka to Kaziranga Wildlife sanctuary in Assam, postcards from across the world were put on display at Rangoli Art Center on MG Road on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENTOrganised by Postcrossing, an online project which allows its members to send and receive postcards from all over the world, the one-day exhibition witnessed several youngsters thronging the place, curiously looking at the hundreds of postcard exhibits.

900 postcards on displayAs many as 900 cards on display were collected from 107 countries. Most of them were of the The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) heritage sites.

Speaking to Deccan Herald, Col Akhil Kumar, the organiser of the event, said the idea of having an exchange of postcards and putting them on display was not just to facilitate interaction but also understand the various cultures.

“If someone was to take a careful look at these cards, they would also understand how people from different parts of the world write in the same language differently. Some write it all in capital letters, the dialect is different and so is the style of addressing someone,” Kumar added.

According to statistics, he said, Karnataka received and sent the maximum number of postcards in the country. “There are three Unesco sites here and not all know about it.”

The Postcrossing group has been meeting for over four years now and the postcards were collected after seeking permission from the members of the group who had sent and received these letters. 

The members of the group are also of the belief that this would help educate people across the world about all the Unesco sites.
