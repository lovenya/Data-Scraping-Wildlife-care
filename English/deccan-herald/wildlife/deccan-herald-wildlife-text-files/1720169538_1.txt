Bhadra Vanyajeevi Samrakshana Samsthe managing trustee D V Girish and wild life preservation volunteer G Veeresh have expressed concern that biodiversity will be hit by artificial lake construction work taken up by the forest department at Basur Kaval wildlife zone in Amrit Mahal Basur Kaval in Kadur taluk.

They said various works being executed by the forest department have posed a threat to the wildlife. The natural habitats of the wildlife have been spoiled by constructing lakes and percolation ponds with the help of machinery.

The deep trenches dug in the area have become a hurdle for the movement of animals. The region has natural lakes and the wild animals have not faced water scarcity. The senior officials of the department have taken up unnecessary works only to misuse the funds, they charged.

From 2013, 14 lake construction works have been taken up. The scientific construction of lakes in Basur Kaval has been adversely affecting the wildlife. It is sad that the forest department, which is supposed to protect the natural habitat of the animals, has been destroying them instead.

The forest officials, PWD officials and some Zilla Panchayat members are hand in gloves, they alleged. They urged the departments concerned to clear hundreds of acres of land in Basur Kaval.

“The works on lake construction should be stopped immediately. Or else, a legal fight will be launched to protect Basur Kaval.”ADVERTISEMENT
