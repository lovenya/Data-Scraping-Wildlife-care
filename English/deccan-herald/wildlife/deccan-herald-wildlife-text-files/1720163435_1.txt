The flood situation in Assam turned worse on Friday with water level raising in 21 districts in lower and upper Assam districts.

ADVERTISEMENTAt least five people have died in the past 24 hours. Nearly 16 lakh people have been affected and over 2 lakh of them are in relief camps while lakhs are waiting for relief to reach them.

According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) sources, at least five people – one each in Mayong, Naharkatia and Dibrugarh and two people in Goalpara district have lost their lives in the deadly deluge in the past 24 hours. Flood waters have completely ravaged 2080 villages.

 The Brahmaputra is flowing above danger mark in five districts, and its tributaries are also in full spate across the state.

Apart from Dibrugarh districts, the Army has been called in rescue operation in Nagaon districts. Several teams of NDRF and SDRF are involved in relief works, government sources added.

Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi made an aerial survey of floods affected Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, North Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts.

Wild animals in Kaziranga National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary are marooned and forest guards are trying to move them to higher grounds. 

Taking advantage of rising flood waters poachers killed a one-horned male rhino and took away its horn in Bagori Range of Kaziranga.

Meanwhile, Assam government has reacted to Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Sarbananda Sonowal’s recent statement that the Centre had released Rs 207 crore for flood relief.

The state government had clarified that the Central funds of Rs 207 crore released to the state government by the Centre was only the first installment of the current year’s central allocation of Rs 414 crore available under the State Disaster Response Funds.

The State government has last week urged the Centre for immediate release of Rs 500 crore for better flood relief.
