If you love pristine Nature, wildlife, rich culture and heritage, Assam is the perfect destination for you. To drive home the point and to promote tourism in Assam, a roadshow was held in the City on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENTOfficials from the Department of Tourism, Government of Assam, held an interactive session to showcase the potential of Assam as an ideal tourist destination.

“Assamese culture, the state’s wildlife, green golf courses, sprawling tea gardens and the majestic Brahmaputra make Assam truly matchless. The place has immense tourism potential both for domestic and overseas travellers. It is well connected and safe. People are warm and hospitable. We invite one and all to visit Assam,” said Ashutosh Agnihotri, Commissioner and Secretary, Tourism Department, Government of Assam.

Agnihotri further said Assam tourism was planning to ink a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Railways to start a tourist train for Assam. “This will connect key destinations in the state that a tourist will want to travel to. This experience will be pocket-friendly, yet exotic.”

During 2014-15, Assam’s domestic inbound tourist flow stood at 45,00,000, while overseas tourist flow was 25,000.
