However, these centuries old trees have stood against all odds and become testimony to the conservation of forest. 

The trees include teak wood, Terminalia Tomentosa or Matthi mara and Bombax ceiba or Boorugada mara. 

Bombax ceiba or Boorugada mara is seen en route to Mavinahalla in Lakkavalli range. The tree is more than 200 years old and has a 32 feet trunk. It provides food for squirrels during summer. 

Terminalia Tomentosa or Matthi mara is found in Balegundikere in Thanigebailu. The tree has 22 feet trunk and is 300 years old, says environmentalists. 

Teak wood is found en route to Kesave from Muthodi. The tree is 400 years old and has 17 feet trunk. 

“The huge trees in Bhadra reserve forest speaks of the quality of protection,” said Bhadra Wildlife Protection Trust Trustee D V Girish.
