But due to lack of expertise, there are chances of the big cat dying in the trap, or the animal attacking humans out of fear in the process of trapping and releasing it in the forest.

Incidents of leopards ‘straying’ into settlements causing human casualties, and the retaliatory killing of leopards by the public, have been on the rise. The efﬁcacy of capture and translocation of leopards from conﬂict areas as a mitigation measure is increasingly being questioned. 

The Ministry of Environment and Forests has issued guidelines to contain man-leopard conflict. The guidelines include creating awareness  and involvement of people, team work in tackling conflict, establishment of emergency response mechanism, management of crowd and animal, capture and handling of the trapped animal, release or translocation of the captured leopard, transportation of the captured animal, monitoring of the translocated leopards, helping rural people better protect their livestock through confidence-building measure, expeditious and effective delivery of ex gratia, collection of information on leopard conflict, dealing with man-eater leopards, protocol to be followed in case of leopard attacks, care and caution in designing traps.

The guidelines are a result of the consultations with, and suggestions from, a wide range of individuals and organisations concerned, besides drawing upon reports and scientific studies available on human-leopard conflict. 

However, despite the guidelines from the Centre, there are no efforts made by the State 
forest department in that direction, according to wildlife enthusiasts.

According to the guidelines, a Primary Response (PR) Team has to be established in every forest division. Primary Response teams may comprise paid or volunteer members from the local communities, who are trained to respond immediately to a conﬂict situation. Their primary aim is to control the crowd and secure the area till the Emergency Response Team arrives. 

The establishment of a Primary Response team is important to ensure crowd control before the ER team reaches the spot. The guidelines also touch upon the need for awareness among people that leopards are not usually inclined to attack people; on the contrary, they avoid people. The wild carnivores may attack in self-defence, and, therefore, it is advisable to avoid provoking them. 

Besides mere sighting of a leopard in the vicinity of human habitations does not necessarily mean that the animal has strayed from a forest and needs to be captured and that arbitrary removal of leopards could lead to increased conﬂict.

The guidelines also call for team work in tackling conflicts and involves the police and revenue departments as they are crucial for maintaining law and order in the face of extreme reactions. In case of attack on humans or livestock, a senior police officers should visit the spot and provide immediate relief to the victims.

In place where the incidents of leopard attacks are high, the local legislator, grama panchayat representatives, officers of revenue and animal husbandry department, should meet every six months to tackle emergencies related to attacks by leopards.
