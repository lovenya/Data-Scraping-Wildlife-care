It may be noted that the task force had recommended prohibiting  the sale, transfer, gifting, lease and donation of elephants among other things. 

“We only advised them that drastic measures should not be resorted to. Kerala is perhaps the only state where a large number of elephants are used in festivals and people covet the ownership of an elephant. Perhaps, the practices can be phased out in the long run through an awareness drive,” said Principal Chief Conservator of Forests T M Manoharan.

He told Deccan Herald that guardianship theory as suggested by the task force would not benefit elephants. 

“True, there is ill-treatment by some mahouts and owners and that  should be curbed. But there are also many mahouts and owners who look after them very well,” he said. He claimed that guardianship did not bring the same responsibility to the animal as ownership. 

“The state can neither take guardianship of the nearly 1,000 elephants in the state nor can they be pushed to the wild to mingle with the elephants there,” said Manoharan.
The department arrived at this stand following opposition by elephant owners and some temples to the proposal and the expenses of maintaining the animals. The annual cost of maintenance of an elephant would be over Rs 3 lakh.ADVERTISEMENTOwners’ view

What has raised eyebrows is the fact that ownership would also allow sale of elephants which was at present banned under the Wildlife Act. “They are only parroting the elephant owners’ view which is not the state’s stand. It goes against all the prevailing statutes and rules concerning elephant which have even been upheld by the high court. 

Their efforts are not going to bear fruit,” said Venkitachelam, president of the Kerala Elephant Lovers’ Association. 

He pointed out that the elephant owners were unable to put across valid arguments before the task force headed by Mahesh Rangarajan when it held its sitting in Kerala.
