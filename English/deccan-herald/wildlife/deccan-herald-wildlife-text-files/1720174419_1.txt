It is the United Nations’ flagship day for promoting worldwide awareness and action for the environment. It is the ‘People’s Day’ for doing something positive for the environment. Its aim is to harness individual actions and to transform them into a collective power that has a legacy of real and lasting impact on the planet. It is celebrated in various ways, from beach clean-ups and tree planting to calling on staff and partners to get involved and do their bit.This year, the theme of the UN World Environment Day is ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’ with a tagline ‘If you can’t reuse it, refuse it’. The campaign is being popularised with #BeatPlasticPollution.Plastic pollution is the biggest environmental challenges, with statistics showing that there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish by 2050. Whether it is a bottled soft drink, a bag from the supermarket, or a spoon in a coffee shop, single-use plastic has become embedded in our daily lives. Low-cost, convenience and lightness of these products have revolutionised the packaging of goods. However, it is now clear that this convenience has had a catastrophic impact on the environment.
