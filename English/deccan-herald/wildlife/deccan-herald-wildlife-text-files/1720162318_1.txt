A male tiger which had strolled out of the forest and was taking rest in a pool of water was rescued by the Forest department at B Colony of Basavanagiri Hadi near the Nagarahole national park in the taluk on Thursday. The big cat was later sent to the Koorgalli rehabilitation centre near Mysuru.

ADVERTISEMENTIt is said that the tiger had become weak as it could not get food in the forest. Forest personnel, including Range Forest Officer Puttaswamy, arrived at the spot after they were informed by local residents who spotted the tiger.

The six-year-old feline was tranquilised by Dr Umashankar of the Hunsur wildlife division and sent to the rehabilitation centre, but not before it created some tense moments. As soon as the tranquiliser dart was fired at the animal, it pounced on three Forest department personnel, including Rama and Mahadeva. However, the Forest personnel did not suffer any injuries. 

Soon, it became unconscious. Personnel of the Metikuppe forest range captured the tiger in a net and took it to the rehabilitation centre. The big cat was later caged and its consciousness was restored with an injection. The tiger was found to have suffered an injury on one of its right limbs and an abnormal growth on its neck.

“The injuries might be due to a territorial fight. Since the tiger has some visual impairment in its right eye, it is also possible that it was injured in a hunt,”  V Karikalan, Deputy Conservator of Forests, said. The wounds, which includes a deep injury on its right forelimb, had restricted the movements of the animal, rendering it unable to hunt. He said a decision on whether the animal will be released into the wild after treatment will be taken after the tiger is healthy again.
