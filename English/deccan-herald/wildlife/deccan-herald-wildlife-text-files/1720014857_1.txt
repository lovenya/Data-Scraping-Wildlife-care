Speaking after waving off the green flag for Shimoga-Anandapuram train in the City on Saturday, he said Union Minister of State for Environment and Forest Jairam Ramesh also has been approached over the issue.

As the proposed route will pass through thick forest, including Sharavathi Wildlife Sanctuary, he informed that of the 82-km stretch, tunnels as long as 20 km will be constructed to minimise the loss of forest. 

Muniyappa said that much ‘circus’ has been done to convince Jairam Ramesh on the need to implement the project. He informed that the project to connect Shimoga-Talaguppa with Konkan Railway will cost Rs 2,000 crore.

The survey report on Shimoga-Harihar train route has been submitted to the Railway Board. 

The viability and feasibility factors will be carefully examined.
