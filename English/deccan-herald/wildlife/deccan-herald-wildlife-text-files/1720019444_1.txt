While the animal lovers can view the rare animals and birds at Bandipur and B R Hills, the eucalyptus grove near Suvarnavathy reservoir, in Attugulipura, has thousands of bats hanging on the trees, which is a rare view. Interestingly, it is observed that more than 2,000 bats have made these eucalyptus trees a living place since decades.

Attugulipura is on the national highway-209 after passing Chikkohole reservoir and the quarters belonging to Public Works Department where more than 150 eucalyptus trees have grown. Once you enter the premises, you can hear the screeching sound of the bats which makes you raise your head to watch the hanging wonders in awe.

Locals say that they have grown up watching these mammals since decades at the place which belongs to BRT wildlife sanctuary range. If the trees or axed in the name of development it is sure to kill these mammals, they lament.

The physical structure of these creatures are different with unique wings which perform the work of hands. It is very soft and transparent, which enables them to climb and cling to the walls and corners of caves, temples and other places. It makes a different sound which echoes that helps these creatures to fly.

Animal experts say there are about 900 types of bats in the world and sometimes the sound it makes cannot be recognised by the human ears, as their wavelengths are very low. 

The bats breed at the warmer regions as they can find food throughout the year and depends on frogs, small reptiles like lizards for food.Â  There are blood sucking bats too popularly known as vampires, that are found mostly in African countries and lives in groups. 

The breeding is mostly during summer and it is said that the pregnant bat leaves its place and lives with its other members in groups. The female bat gives birth two times in a year.
