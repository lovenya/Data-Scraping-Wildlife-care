Spending by Indian travellers in South Africa has crossed ZAR 1.1 billion (Rs 551 crore) with 81,429 arrivals by the end of the third quarter, a growth of 27%. 

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing reporters at the South African Tourism Trade Delegation roadshow here on Tuesday, SA Tourism India country manager Hanneli Slabber said, “Overall, average spend per leisure traveller from India was placed at ZAR 150,000 (Rs 5,90,000), indicating that South Africa attracts a variety of pocket sizes.”

“We want to sustain this growth, and also attract return travellers. Going forward, we would focus on increasing the geographical scope of the market — our biggest sources are Mumbai and Delhi, followed by Bengaluru and Chennai at present,” Hanneli added.

The average number of nights by Indian tourists in South Africa now stands at 11 for leisure, and 19 for business, with the ‘Rainbow Nation’ attracting scores of Indian travellers wanting to soak in adventure, culture, wildlife, cricket and history, among other interests.
