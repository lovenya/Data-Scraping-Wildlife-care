As help pours in from all quarters for the victims of the recent floods in Kodagu, The Bangalore School of Music is doing its bit to raise funds for their relief.ADVERTISEMENTTheir jazz and contemporary music department has collaborated with some of the city’s most talented musicians to present ‘Musicians for Kodagu’, a 90-minute exploration of jazz as well as other forms of contemporary music on September 14 at 7 pm at the Alliance Française de Bangalore.Speaking about the concert, Jagadeesh MR, Director-Operations of The Bangalore School of Music and Head of Jazz and Contemporary Music Department, says, “We have composed a special rendition with a Sanskrit Shloka ‘Song for Kodagu’ and we will be performing that. But raising money is only a part of it; we also want to raise awareness about the damage to the environment. Kodagu is one of the greenest areas of Karnataka and it should remain that way.” The performers include Jagadeesh MR, Madhuri Jagadeesh, Mythili Anantharaman, Joshua Lance, Rohit PS from ‘MoonArra Electric Jazz Fusion’, Anand Ramakrishna, Aman Mahajan, P S Rohit from ‘Jazz Anand Ramakrishna Trio’, Geetha and Gopal Navale- members of the Esperanto Project Duet, Ananth Menon, Vasudev Prabhu, Joe Antony from ‘By 2 Blues’ and Sangeetha Hosea, Sangeetha Das, Rajini Shivaram and Supreeth Kurthukoti from contemporary group ‘Midnight Poppies’.In addition to the concert, there will be a brief presentation by Bangalore-based environmentalist and wildlife enthusiast Joseph Hoover on Kodagu’s endangered and fragile flora and fauna.He says, “We have deforested the area and given away forest land for plantations. The government’s tree policy has also played a role. We have been causing more and more damage and we are paying the cost for it now. The global warming is also increasing. We need to start putting things in place right now and everybody needs to come together to save the environment.” The proceeds from the concert will be donated to the Kodagu Flood Relief. The tickets to the concert, priced at Rs 400, are available on www.bookmyshow.com
