The Central government and the Union forest ministry have issued a deadline to the state government to declare eco-sensitive zones under all national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to the agenda adopted by the National Wildlife Board in 2002, declaration of sensitive zone around wildlife sanctuaries is compulsory. 

Again, the Supreme Court ruled that a radius of 10 km should be declared as eco-sensitive zone around national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

Only Haryana, Gujarat, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Assam and Goa had complied by the Supreme Court order. So, the court directed the other states to comply in an order on December 4, 2006.

Meanwhile, some of the state governments had submitted a memorandum before the Centre to frame guidelines for declaration of eco-sensitive zones. Thus came the guidelines on February 9, 2011, from the Union environment and forest ministry.

However, none of the states took any action to declare eco-sensitive zones. Again, now, the Union environment and forest ministry has written letters to state governments to submit proposals on declaration of eco-sensitive zones before February 15. The onus is on the state chief secretaries to implement the order.

The state government should take steps to declare eco-sensitive zones in cooperation with local grama panchayats and revenue department. 

The declaration would not affect either any day-to-day activities of the people or agriculture. Rather, organic farming, rainwater harvesting and other eco-friendly activities would get a boost.

However, mining activities, quarrying, industries, hotels, saw mills and hydro-electricity generation units are not allowed in a radius of 10 km national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
