According to the Forest department officers, the Bhadra forests is the most suitable habitat for the tiger, bereft of any human interference in the vicinity. Union Minister of Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh is expected to be present on the occasion. 

The tiger is healthy at the Tyavarekoppa Lion Safari. The procedure for setting the big cat free has already been finalised, Deputy Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) T J Ravikumar said. The 10-year-old tiger, which strayed into Gama village, had killed a man on May 1.
