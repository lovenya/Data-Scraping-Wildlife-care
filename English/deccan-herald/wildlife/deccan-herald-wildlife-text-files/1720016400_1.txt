The carcass of the tiger, identified as “ ST-1” was found by a forest department team members near Rajaugarh on Sunday night when they were searching for another tiger 

“ST-4” who has been missing for the last three days, officials said on Monday. The injury marks indicate that the tiger was killed probably in a territorial fight with another tiger, they said, adding the exact cause of death will be clear only after post-mortem. National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) head Rajesh Gopal has rushed to the tiger reserve. 

“Prima facie it seems that the tiger, which was the first one to be relocated to Sariska two years ago from Ranthambore sanctuary, died in a territorial fight with another predator which is common among the species,” an NTCA official said.

The Sariska tiger reserve lost all its tigers by 2004-05, mostly to widespread poaching, after which five tigers, two of them males, were translocated there since 2008 to revive their population.

Describing the incident as a “very, very unfortunate”, tiger expert Belinda Wright sought to question the entire translocation process saying that the authorities had hastily shifted the animals without rectifying the problems in Sariska which had led to disappearance of all its native big cats.

“No efforts have been made to close two major national highways which are running through the reserve. Moreover, villages and influx of pilgrims in Pandupole inside the tiger reserve are a major source of disturbance to wildlife,” she added.

Terming the development as shocking, Rajasthan forest Minister Ramlal Jat said efforts are on to locate the other missing tiger.  Three tigers — a male and two females — were shifted to Sariska from Ranthambore reserve, also in Rajasthan, in 2008 and 2009. However, they failed to produce any offspring and it was later found that they were siblings.ADVERTISEMENT
