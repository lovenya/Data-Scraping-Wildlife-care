The Committee will make efforts to help Karnataka “dispel” apprehensions about the World Heritage status. It will also work on updating India’s dossier for the serial nomination of the Western Ghats and chart out the follow-up actions listed by Unesco’s World Heritage Committee.

The Committee which was constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) on August 31, 2010 has the Additional Director General of Forests (wildlife) Jagadish Kishwan as the chairman; with members being the Chief Wildlife Wardens of six states – Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu; Advisor to MoEF and Member Secretary, Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel Dr G V Subrahmanyam; representatives of ATREE; Nature Conservation Foundation, Mysore; and Director, Wildlife Institute of India, Dr V B Mathur.
According to Mathur, Karnataka’s fears are unwarranted. 

“We want to ask the government what the problem is and to reiterate there is no legal regime by Unesco once the status is granted. The Forest Act, Forest Rights Act and Wildlife Act are already in place, and these are the only rules that will have to be adhered to. If need be, the Committee will hold discussions with the elected representatives,” he said.

MoEF also came under criticism for not holding proper consultations with the locals of the Ghats. The information to be now submitted by India pertains to governance and administrative mechanisms for the 39 serial sites in the Western Ghats once they are included; review of recommendations, if any, of the Western Ghats Expert Ecology Panel chaired by Dr Madhav Gadgil pertaining to the 39 serial sites, among other things.
