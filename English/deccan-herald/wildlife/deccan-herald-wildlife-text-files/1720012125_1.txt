They want to pass the onus of mitigation to the developing world, which puts them under tremendous pressure to commit to emission cuts, even when no financial support or technology is offered. In January this year, India committed to reduce the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product by 20-25 per cent below the 2005 level by 2020, barring the agriculture sector.

Growth and low-carbon?
In 2009, the Centre for Science and Environment’s Green Rating Project decided to study the most energy and emissions intensive sectors of the Indian industry. Six sectors namely paper and pulp, cement, aluminium, steel and fertiliser fitted the bill with the lion’s share going to the power sector. In 2008-09, these six sectors accounted for an estimated 61.5 per cent of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in India.

The data is obtained from the industry and is subsequently verified. It identifies the various technology options for these sectors to reduce their energy and emissions intensities as well as projects the trajectory these sectors will take up till 2030-31, under two scenarios, business as usual (BAU) and a utopic low carbon (LC).

Annual mitigation potential of LC over BAU would be about 18 per cent in 2030-31. Keeping in mind the massively deployed renewable energy technology in the power sector, the highest cumulative GHG emission savings will be seen in the power sector.  The study shows that in both the scenarios (BAU and LC), the sector’s performance will peak by 2020, hence stagnating the emission reduction options thereafter. 

In the business as usual scenario, the emissions intensity from these six sectors will reduce by about 20 per cent below 2008-09 levels by 2020. In the low carbon scenario, the emissions intensity can further reduce to 30 per cent below 2008-09 levels by 2020. The fallout lies after 2020, as the emissions intensity in these sectors dip only marginally or even stagnate in both the scenarios.

The highlight of the study is however the anticipated massive requirement of resources, plunging the whole country in a state of perpetual destabilisation. Bearing in mind the limitation of the existent technology available, the emission status after 2030-31 does not seem to have been considered. According to the study, the demand of resources such as water and land can become inhibitory to India’s growth, under the current growth plan scenario.

Coal: In BAU, the coal requirement for the six sectors will quadruple by 2030-31, a challenge with vast environmental and social consequences. According to the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), India will have to import about 500 million metric tonnes to be able to meet the requirement of only these six sectors. In LC, the requirement will be thrice the current level of production as projected by the IEP.
Iron ore: In 2008-09, India exported 60 per cent of the total iron ore mined. By 2030-31, the demand for iron ore will double the amount currently mined in both the scenarios, because of the low contribution of scrap to steel production in the country.
Bauxite: Bauxite requirement to make aluminium will increase almost five-fold by 2030-31 in both the scenarios.
Limestone: BAU will see a four-fold increase in limestone requirement by 2030-31, with a marginally lower increase in LC. The difference is because of the assumption of increased used of blended cement production in LC.

Fresh water demand
In 2008-09, the six sectors withdrew freshwater equivalent to the freshwater demand of 1.1 million people on a daily basis, and water lost from the water cycle equalled the amount required for drinking and cooking by more than a billion people on a daily basis. Freshwater withdrawal in the six sectors will hike by 40 per cent by 2030 and the freshwater consumption will more than triple in the next two decades, bringing huge social and environmental implications, as this water would be lost from the water cycle. Feshwater withdrawal in LC is about three per cent lower than in BAU. The already existent water scarcity would reach its peak.

Land demand
An estimated one million ha. of additional land will be required by 2030-31 for mines and to set up plants from now, the magnitude similar to the land use for the past 60 years. The power sector will take up 64 per cent of land, steel and cement sector 16 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.

Estimates show low carbon growth will require 30 per cent more land than BAU, due to enhanced power production capacity from solar energy assumed in LC.
The study indicates that the current growth plan ensures violations and acquisitions will continue to displace people and wild life alike, along with damaging forest areas for non forest reasons.
