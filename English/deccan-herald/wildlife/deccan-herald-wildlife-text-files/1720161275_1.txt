The leopard, which died after being hit by a speeding vehicle on Bannerghatta Road, near Kalkere Circle, on Monday evening, was one-month pregnant.

ADVERTISEMENTInitial postmortem reports revealed that the leopard was carrying three foetuses and had suffered severe internal injuries due to the impact.

According to the wildlife veterinarian at the Bannerghatta Biological Park, the left side of the animal had internal bleeding and the liver was completely damaged. The visceral samples has been sent to Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals for analysis, the veterinarian said.

Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) authorities have said the incident comes as a warning as they could expect more such incidents in the future.  

Assistant Conservator of Forest M K Cholarajappa said they have filed an FIR under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. He said it was unfortunate the incident took place adjacent to the BNP office.

“With no streetlights, the speeding vehicle might have not seen the leopard crossing the road and hit the animal,” Cholarajappa said.

He said as there was increased human habitation rearing poultry, cattle and presence of stray dogs, the leopard might have ventured out of Kalkere forest in search of food.

BNP, he said, would speak to the local administration to instal boards informing motorists to slow down. There are plans to have more scientific humps on the stretch to control speed, he said.
