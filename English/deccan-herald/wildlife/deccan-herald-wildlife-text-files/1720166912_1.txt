The state forest department has launched an SMS-based system to warn villagers against elephant herds running into villages.

ADVERTISEMENTThe system is being launched in a bid to provide early warning of such pachyderm visits and to prevent destruction of property or attacks from rogue elephants. The system will be in place later this month. 

Chief wildlife warden of Bengal, P K Vyas, said that the department has taken number of steps to prevent man-elephant conflict, which has gone up considerably in the last decade.
While the SMS-based early warning system has been developed to alert villagers, the forest department has also started tracking daily movement of elephants. “This will help us identify rogue elephants and keep an eye on movement of herds,” Vyas said.

The state government has also set up an Elephant Movement Coordination Committee in May to track such movement, particularly in south Bengal. “This will help us ensure free movement of elephants. Repeated obstructions cause elephants to get irritated and lead to conflicts,” Vyas said. The committee is also engaging experts to map barriers so that all obstructions are removed from the usual route of herds.

Senior officials pointed out that man-elephant conflicts in Bengal went up since Odisha and Nepal authorities started setting up barriers like trenches and electrified fences.
