Nine monkeys were found dead at Nirmala Health Centre in Tarabanahalli near Soladevanahalli on Friday. 

ADVERTISEMENTInspector C J Rangaswamy said the monkeys were poisoned as they used to damage solar heating equipment at the centre. 

“The residents told us that the staff of the health centre gave ‘ragi balls’ laced with poison to the monkeys,” he said. 

However, Helen, in-charge of the health centre, denied the allegations, saying she was unaware of the monkeys having been poisoned. 

Carcasses of the monkeys were taken to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals (IAH&VB) for post mortem. Director of IAH&VB Dr Renukaprasad said post mortem would be conducted only on Saturday.

The Soladevanahalli police have registered a case under the Wildlife Protection and Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act.
