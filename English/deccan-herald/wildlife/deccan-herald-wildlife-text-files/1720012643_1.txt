Last year, nearly 1.7 lakh Olive Ridley turtles had participated in the mass nesting ritual in Orissa. 

As the current round of mass nesting has taken place not far away from the missile testing centre at the nearby Wheelers’ Island, only forest department employees have been allowed to man the area for protection of the turtle eggs from predators like stray dogs, jackals, sea gulls and crows. 

“As the turtles have laid their eggs on part of the beach which is a prohibited zone, only employees of the forest department and not private volunteers have been allowed to patrol the area for turtle egg protection. Nearly fifty forest department employees have been deployed in the area for this purpose,” an official said. 

A female turtle first digs a small hole on the beach, mostly after sunset, and covers the hole with sands after laying eggs in them. It takes about 45 days for baby turtles to come out of the holes for their maiden journey to the sea. One female turtle usually lays around 100 to 120 eggs. However, not all of them remain intact to give birth to baby turtles.
