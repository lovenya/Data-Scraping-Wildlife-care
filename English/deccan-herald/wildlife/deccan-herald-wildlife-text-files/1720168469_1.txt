The state tourism department has declared 2017 the ‘Year of the Wild’ and will cater to tourists keen on exploring the wilderness and wildlife of Karnataka.

ADVERTISEMENTThe campaign ‘Year of the Wild’ was launched by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Minister of State for Tourism Priyank Kharge on Saturday. 

Speaking on the occasion, Kharge said the Tourism department, in association with the Forest department, had identified nine eco-trekking routes in the Western Ghats which will be opened to tourists and trekkers soon. 

Trained nature guides will accompany and educate tourists about nature conservation on these trekking routes, he said. 

Kharge said Karnataka had the largest number of eco-lodges with 17 jungle resorts and five jungle camps. 

Surfing festival

He said an international-level surfing festival will be held in Mangaluru in mid-2017 to promote Karnataka’s beaches as a water sports destination. 

Siddaramaiah also launched a mobile app that provides app-based reservation system for Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation hotels. The app provides access to a database of all trained and certified tourist guides in the state and tourists can directly call these guides and fix appointments with them. 

A department official said KSTDC will provide 5% discount on tariffs for its hotels and tours, if booked through the app.
