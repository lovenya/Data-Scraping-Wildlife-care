Actor Carey Mulligan has said that she has always looked for films with strong women characters and felt "honoured" to portray such roles on screen.ADVERTISEMENTThe "Never Let Me Go" actor said her choices as an actor are driven by the need to show women in leadership roles to young girls which she thought is "important"."It's a remarkable honour to be able to portray these strong characters - these women with such complexity - and I want to do it as much as possible," Mulligan said, according to Femalefirst."I think that it is important for young girls to watch a movie or a television series and see women in these leadership roles, making decisions for themselves and being proactive - I'm driven by that," she added.Mulligan will be next seen in "Wildlife", which marks the directorial debut of actor Paul Dano. The film also features Jake Gyllenhaal, Ed Oxenbould, and Zoe Margaret Colletti.
