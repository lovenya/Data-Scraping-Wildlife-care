He was discharged on Christmas Eve, in time to rejoin the rest of the royal family for the festive period.Since the pandemic, Philip has made few public appearances. He was last seen at a staged appearance at a military ceremony at Windsor Castle in July, days after attending the wedding ceremony of his granddaughter Princess Beatrice. In November, he and The Queen marked the latest anniversary of their 1947 nuptials by releasing a photograph of them together, again at Windsor.Philip and the queen have four children -- Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward -- eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.Philip, the longest-serving consort in British history, was born on the island of Corfu with Danish and Greek royal titles.He fled the country when he was just 18 months old with his parents and four sisters, after his uncle, king Constantine of Greece, was forced to abdicate.The family initially settled in France.Philip was formally introduced to princess Elizabeth, the future queen, in July 1939 and they kept in touch during the war, meeting on a number of occasions.The pair married in Westminster Abbey in London in 1947.A rising star in the British navy, Philip had reached the rank of commander by the time Elizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952. He eventually shelved his personal ambitions to support his wife in the role.Over the ensuing decades, he was involved in numerous charities, including the World Wildlife Fund For Nature and the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme for young people.
