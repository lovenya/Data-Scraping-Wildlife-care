The mishap, which occurred at around 7 pm on Wednesday — when the female elephant calf was returning to the forest after slaking its thirst at Moolehole (river) —  is one of the worst road kills in the past seven years.

“The mother and calf were crossing the road when the speeding truck heading towards Gundlupet in Karnataka hit the calf. The calf was stuck beneath the vehicle and was dragged for about 50 feet,” said a source in the Forest Department.

On a tip-off by a passerby, forest officials stopped all the vehicles at Maddur checkpost and seized the truck. “We checked all the vehicles and identified the truck from the elephant skin and flesh that was stuck on the wheels,” he said. Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife Warden B K Singh told Deccan Herald that the driver of the truck, Abdul Azeez, a resident of Kozhikode in Kerala, was arrested under the Wildlife Protection Act and produced before the court.
