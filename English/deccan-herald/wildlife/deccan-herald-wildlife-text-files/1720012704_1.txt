However, the incessant rains through the whole of last year and the increase in temperature could be a reason for their absence this year, says Founding Trustee of Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust, D V Girish, who has been into bird watching for the last 23 years.

“Every year the rains would end by the first week of November and the water in lakes would have reduced by half by the second week of December. But this year, it is still raining and the birds do not prefer to fish in full lakes,” he said.

This has never happened in the last 23 years, recalled Girish. He remarks that a lot more research needs to be conducted into this change in pattern of migratory birds.
