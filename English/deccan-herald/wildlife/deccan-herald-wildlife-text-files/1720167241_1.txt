A wild tiger has reportedly killed two head of cattle in and around the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), south Bengaluru, in the last one month. The deaths were reported in Ragihalli and Anekal. 

ADVERTISEMENTForest officials confirmed the deaths but denied that the cattle were killed by the tiger. They instead suspect a leopard. A forest official says that villagers take their cattle into the forest for grazing in violation of both the Forest Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. In many cases, they leave the cattle to graze in forest patches and then go in search of them late in the evening. 

The official accused local residents and NGOs — fighting for Hakki Pikki tribespeople living near the BNP — of spreading “rumours” that the tiger in the park was a threat to villagers. The tiger has been living in the forest spread across 270 sq km for more than one-and-a-half years now. “There are no reports of anyone being attacked. 

These are just two stray cases,” he insisted. Forest officials and veterinarians say the tiger and leopards have been living for years in the BNP. There is sufficient prey density, like deer and other small herbivores, in the forest though cattle is an easy prey for carnivores. “Knowing that there are carnivores in the forest, including elephants, villagers still take their cattle into the forests,” he said. “This is dangerous.” 

Interestingly, villagers who have lost their cattle have not demanded compensation from the Forest Department. 

Sunil Panwar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, BNP, conceded that there had been cattle deaths. He said the BNP staff were investigating the reason. Cattle-grazing is not permitted in the forest and those violating the rules will be dealt with sternly, he added.
