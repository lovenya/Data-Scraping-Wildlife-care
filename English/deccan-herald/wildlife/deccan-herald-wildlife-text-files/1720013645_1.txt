The tiger was found dead in the Madanpur range of Valmiki Nagar forest in Bagaha district in north Bihar. 

Situated on the Indo-Nepal border, some 350 km from here, it is suspected that  poachers were from UP dealing in tiger skin and organs were behind the killing. Tiger skin and organs  are in high demand in the international market, especially in China.

 The poachers are believed to have entered Madanpur through Nepal and killed the endangered species.

Subsequently, a team of National Tiger Conservation Authority has been dispatched to the reserve to take stock of the situation, while the body has been sent for a post-mortem. 

“We received the information about the death of the tiger on Thursday. The Field Director of the Tiger Reserve has already rushed to the spot. But only a post-mortem report will unravel the mystery how the tiger died,” said Bihar’s chief wildlife warden Basheer Ahmad Khan.ADVERTISEMENT
