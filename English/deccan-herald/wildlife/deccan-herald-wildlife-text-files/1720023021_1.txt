The animal was thrown into the air and dragged for several metres. The truck driver, from Kerala, escaped from the scene. A forest watcher, who relayed the message to the Maddur checkpost, ensured that the vehicle was stopped and the driver apprehended.

As per the statistics available, as many as 91 animals and birds have been killed along the stretch - including 19 chitals, two leopards, a tiger and a few elephants - since 2004.The Forest Department officials and wildlife conservationists have requested the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and other road construction agencies - such as - the Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP) - to install scientifically designed speed mitigation devices on the highways. 

As per the Forest Department guidelines and Supreme Court order, the KSHIP has failed to install speed humps, rumble strips and chicanes even on the Mysore-Mananthavadi highway that passes through the southern side of Nagarahole National Park.

The National Wildlife Action Plan, drafted under the chairmanship of the prime minister, has also mandated that highways should be realigned outside the wildlife habitats. 

But the government road construction authorities have shown little interest towards the prime minister’s commitment. 

Even as the security of wild-life is at stake, the Kerala government is trying its best to get the night traffic ban lifted along the Bandipur-Calicut (NH 212) and Bandipur-Mudumalai (NH 67) stretches. 

Member of the Wildlife Matters Trust Guruprasad Thimmapur alleged that the road construction authorities make false promises of adhering to all the conditions while seeking permission for road construction / improvement within wildlife habitats. But they are seldom followed.”
