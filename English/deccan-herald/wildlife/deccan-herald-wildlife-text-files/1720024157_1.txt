Taluk Panchayat members have warned the Forest Department Wildlife Division that they would be paving way for another struggle in the region if people are evicted from Kudremukh National Park area without giving proper compensation.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing the all membersâ€™ meet on Monday, TP Vice-President Nuthan Kumar said that there are several complaints pouring in informing that forest department officials have been threatening and harassing the people living in Kudremukh National Park area.

The meet demanded complete details from forest official K Srinath with regard to complaints that areca trees were fell by the officials in the plantation of Kerekatte residents Virupaksha and his father Manjappa. Further the house also said that there have been complaints with regard to forest department not giving proper compensation to Srinivas from Kattigadde, who wanted to leave the place and go voluntarily.

Responding to this Srinath said that Kattigadde Srinivas has received compensation from service organisation named Tiger Project. Intervening at this point, the members raised objection saying that Tiger Project has not been functioning judiciously in the region.

Sent out of schools

During the meeting, many members brought to the notice of the house the practice followed by some private schools of forcefully giving Transfer Certificates to students of eighth and ninth standard who are not good at studies, with the view of enhancing the results in 10th standard examination. 

Further, those students studying in tenth standard who are not good at studies are being asked to appear for the examination privately. 

The BEO was asked to take steps to see to it that such incidents do not happen in the region in future.
