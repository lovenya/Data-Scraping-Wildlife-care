They serve as a key source of fresh water supply by soaking the rainfall and recharging the groundwater.The aim of the Ramsar list is to develop and maintain an international network of wetlands which are important for the conservation of biological diversity and for sustaining human life.Karnataka is the only southern state without any Ramsar site while its neighbours have. There are three such sites in Kerala (Ashtamudi, Sasthamkotta and Vembanad Kol) and one each in Tamil Nadu (Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary) and Andhra Pradesh (Kolleru Lake).
