In a PIL, the petitioners, People for Animals (PFA) have sought directions not to transport the horses until adequate infrastructure is provided at the place to which the race course will be shifted.

The petitioners submitted that race horses require proper care, diet and exercise, and that six people be entrusted with the care of each of them.

Pointing out that the horses need to be protected as per the Prevention of Cruelty of Animal Act (1960), and Wildlife Protection Act (1972), they submitted that the new site, being a vacant land, is without proper utilities and facilities.

The division bench has ordered notice to the Public Works Department, Race Horse Owners Association and Turf Club.
