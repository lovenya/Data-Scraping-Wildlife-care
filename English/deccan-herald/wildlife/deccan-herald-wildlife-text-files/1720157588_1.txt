Ten minor girls were rescued from Prabhath Circus camp at Kengeri in a joint operation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department and members of  Bachpan Bachao Andolan Committee (BBAC) here on Saturday. Three persons including the circus manager have been arrested in this connection.

However, once in City, they were forced to perform dangerous stunts in the circus, Vidya, a rescue worker with the BBAC said. Confirming the rescue operation, Meena Jain, Chairperson of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) said the panel would meet the girls on Sunday to obtain their statements. 

She said the Committee will make necessary arrangements to reunite the girls with their familiess. The girls have been shifted to CWC rehabilitation and shelter facility near Nimhans where they will undergo medical examination and counselling.

Three men, identified as Saibaba (circus manager), Basavaraj and Jaya (both middlemen) have been arrested while another person by name Beera Singh is absconding. Kengeri police have registered cases under Sections 370 (slave trade) and 374 (unlawful forced labour) of IPC.

According to Vidya, with the stringent enforcement of Wildlife Protection Act prohibiting circuses from employing animals, there has been an increase in use of children for mid-air performances and other stunts in circuses.
