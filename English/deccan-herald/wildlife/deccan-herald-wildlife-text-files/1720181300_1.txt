All the animals in different zoos and forests including the Sunderbans are safe."According to the latest tiger-census, the number of big cats in the Sunderbans Reserve Forest has increased to 96 from the previous estimate of 88."Post-Amphan, the number will remain the same," he said.A fawn was born at the Jharkhali Deer Park on the day of storm and this is good news, he said.Meanwhile, Alipore Zoo director Asis Samanta said a total of 35 trees were uprooted in the zoo during the cyclone and the work are being carried out at war footing to clear the area.Amid the coronavirus outbreak, the zoo remains closed since March 17.
