The four laning of Mysuru-Madikeri National Highway witnessed mixed reactions.ADVERTISEMENTCoorg Wildlife Society members feared that the landscape of the district would be adversely affected if the Highway is widened. The landslides in Kodagu in August were due to excessive deforestation. If thousands of trees are felled for road widening, it will intensify the risks in the future, they said.Advocate A K Subbaiah and others have stated that the environmentalists have been posing hurdles for the development of the district. The roads need to be upgraded according to the increase in population, they said.The National Highway Authority officials have held a meeting in this regard in Kushalnagar. Deputy Commissioner P I Sreevidya was part of the meeting in which people expressed their  disagreement with the road work.The authority has proposed to develop Mysuru-Mani road into a four lane Highway. The officials said that Mysuru - Madikeri road will be developed in the first stage. “Mysuru-Bantwal National Highway - 275 passes through Madikeri. As the Bengaluru-Mysuru road widening is expected to start soon, the Mysuru - Madikeri road will facilitate faster movement between the districts. The time for the travel will be reduced and will save fuel,” the engineers from NHAI had stated during the meeting.“The road will aid in faster transportation of agricultural and horticulture crops. An underpass will be constructed to facilitate the movement of wild animals. Also, a bypass will be constructed at Bailukuppe-Guddehosuru and Suntikoppa-Gaddehalla,” they added.
