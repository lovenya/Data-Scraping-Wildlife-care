The union ministry of forest and environment has blamed the East Coast Railways for the recent killing of five elephants in a train accident near Rambha in Odisha’s Ganjam district. 

ADVERTISEMENTTwo senior officials from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) who visited the state on Saturday for an inquiry into the tragic mishap said that the accident could have been averted had the express train that hit the elephants not been running in high speed. 

“The accident could have been easily averted had the speed of the express train been reduced in the elephant crossing zone. We will take up the matter with the railway ministry,”S S Garbyal, a member of the central team, told reporters here.

 Garbyal, an additional director general (wildlife) in the MoEF, said the team would be submitting its report to the ministry very shortly.

 The five pachyderms were killed on the spot when the super fast Coromandel Express heading for Chennai from Howrah rammed into an elephant herd on December 29.  

The mishap occurred when the herd was crossing the track.  The two member central team also held a high level meeting with the senior state government officials.
