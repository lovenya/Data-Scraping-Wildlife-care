The second edition of the Bird Festival, organised by the Eco-Tourism Board, will be held in Hampi-Daroji from January 5, 2017. The focus of the three-day meet is conservation of the threatened Great Indian Bustard (GIB) and its dwindling habitat.  Vinay Lutra, chairman of the Eco-Tourism Board told DH that GIB and other grassland birds are threatened and mostly found in north Karnataka region. 

Vijay Mohan Raj, Chief Conservator of Forests, Belagavi, added that the department will also organise the first ever state-wide GIB survey. The survey will start with the Bird Festival and will be done across the state. It will take two years to complete. Earlier surveys have been done informally in small pockets in Karnataka like Ranebennur in 1998-99. 

The survey will be done with the help of conservationists like Samad Kothur. The forest department does not have a database on the GIB population in Karnataka as they migrate between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In Karnataka, they are found in Gadag, Koppal, Bagalkot, Rannebennur and near Kolar. The first Bird Festival held in 2015 in Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve had focused on hornbills.
