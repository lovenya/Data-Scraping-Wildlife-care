The male monkey had spread terror in Balisahipatana, Ostia and Badhapada gram panchayats in Rajnagar attacking mostly children, the sources said.
A forest officer engaged in the exercise to cage the monkey faced its wrath and was bitten too, the sources said.

Attendance in at least eight government primary schools in the GPs was hit as parents, worrried over the safety of their children, stopped sending them to school, sources said.
Normal life was affected with villagers restricting their outdoor activities. Adult males, wielding lathis, moved in groups to chase the rampaging monkey, sources added.
The operation to capture the monkey began about a week ago as complaints poured in. Officials from Nandankanan Zoological park having expertise in such jobs were pressed into service.

They captured the errant simian using tranquilizing rubber bullets, Manoj Mohapatra, Divisional forest officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (wildlife) forest division, said.
Earlier, officials from Rajnagar mangrove division office here had tried to cage the animal but failed as it bit one of the officers.

It was later released to the unmanned Kalibhanjadiha forest within Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, Mohapatra said adding I joined here as DFO on August 8 and since then, I was receiving complaints of its nuisance".ADVERTISEMENT
