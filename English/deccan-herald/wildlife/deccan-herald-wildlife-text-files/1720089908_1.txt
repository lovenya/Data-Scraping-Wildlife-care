Data of deaths due to poaching since January 2021 is not yet available.The authorities identified "seizure" as the reason for the death of 108 tigers, while 44 big cats died due to "unnatural" causes in this period.According to the NTCA, poaching is considered as the reason for all tiger deaths in the beginning.Supplementary details like post-mortem reports, forensic and lab reports and circumstantial evidence are gathered for closing a particular case as either "natural", "poaching" or "unnatural but not poaching".The onus of proving a case as natural or poaching rests with the state. In the event of any doubt, in spite of the evidence, poaching is ascribed as the reason for death.
