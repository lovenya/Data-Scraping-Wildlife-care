Entry into Reserve forests is believed to be highly restricted, but of late, incidents of miscreants illegally entering and stealing natural resources have come to light at Bisile range, Western Ghats, in Sakleshpur taluk.

ADVERTISEMENTBisile villagers claim that a gang has erected sheds near Boodhi Chowdi Koodige to collect forest produce and are stealing ‘Ramapatre’, ‘Dhoop oil’, ‘Hulikayi’ and other non-timber forest products (NTFP) for several days now. Despite being aware of this, Forest department personnel have not taken any action, they claimed.

When contacted, Assistant Conservator of Forests Ramesh Babu told DH that there is no permission for any person or organisation to collect natural products from the forest.

“However, the Dakshina Kannada District Administration has given permission to a tribal society to collect natural products in a forest near Kukke Subramanya. mmediate action would be initiated against illegal entrants and Yasalur Range Forest Officer and personnel would be directed to take necessary action,” he said.

Environmentalist Bhuvan Kukke said the Forest department had failed to protect the forest and its resources. He said illegal entrants involved in poaching, fishing and other activities would affect wildlife and also the food chain.

Bisile Forest Committee president Ganesh said the government has neglected the issue and there are no forest guards to man the 18,000 hectare Bisile forest.
