Kudremukh Wildlife Division organises three nature camps every year at Kudremukh, Seethanadi in Karkala and Anejari of Kollur. These nature camps are organised for school and college going students and is held during December to January to educate them, he added.

Lauding the efforts made by Daniel, Netalkar said attempts should be made to recognize people with talents and Daniel has unique collections. These stamps focus on different types of birds. Besides their habitats, behaviors and breeding pattern make an important part of the study, he said.

The adjudicator from India Book of Records and Asia Book of Records, Dr Ramachandra J S honored Daniel Monteiro for breaking the existing records. Ramachandra said Daniel has 1,000 stamps exclusively on ducks and about 5,000 stamps on various varieties of birds. 

The collection offers excellent information on bird species and also knowledge on stamps. He has broken the existing records, he added.ADVERTISEMENTMajor attraction
The major attraction of the expo was the gold plated stamp released in Hawaii (USA) in the year 1982. The stamp carries a picture of “Hawaii goose”. The first diamond stamp released in Austria in 2004 with the picture of mute swan is indeed the jewel in the crown of collection.

The first stamp released on bird once again with the picture of mute swan in the Western Australia in the year 1854 is one of the oldest stamps displayed by Daniel. 

The first 20 paisa stamp on bird issued by the government of India is displayed and the stamp carries the picture of “blue magpie.” The stamp was released in the year 1968. 

Besides, there were stamps exclusively on 40 Indian species of birds. The other stamps on birds included stamps on kingfisher, waterfowls, waterbirds, birds of prey, owls, hornbills, Oriel, Bustard, Pelicans, Penguins, kingfishers, Herons, Songbirds, Woodpeckers, Cuckoos, Strokes, Seabirds and others.Speaking to mediapersons, Daniel said that he would attempt for entering Limca Book of Records and Indian Book of Records besides Guinness Book of Record. Currently, the Guinness book of World Record for stamp collection on birds is in the name of Paul Erwin Oswald who hails from Germany. He has the collection of over 2,166 stamps depicting the pictures of birds from as many as 126 countries.              

Daniel said he had cultivated the hobby of collecting the stamps when he was studying in fifth standard. However, he was inspired and guided by philatelist Vittaldas Shanbhag, which proved to be the turning point in his journey towards aiming high. “From then onwards, I decided to achieve something unique,” he added.

His specialisation in philately includes collection of birds of duck family, game birds and stamps on Indian independence. Daniel has organised as many as 159 exhibitions exclusively on stamps till date. Besides, he has conducted more than 31 workshops on environment and philately.The expo was inaugurated by Deputy Commissioner Dr M T Reju.
