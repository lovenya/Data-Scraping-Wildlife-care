When the officials visited the spot, they saw the lorry was carrying many bags of wild gooseberries and was headed towards Kerala. 

Though the lorry was seized and bags of berries were dumped in the premises of forest department office, the officials were forced to think hard about containing the menace, that had grown right under their nose. 

Though according to the law, tribals can collect forest produce for their use, they use it for commercial purposes.   

It is alleged that merchants from Kerala are forcing tribals, who roam inside the forest areas, to collect gooseberries for a paltry sum and sell it in their State for a good margin. 

According to sources, while the merchants buy gooseberries for ` five from the tribals, they sell it for a good ` 40 to buyers in Kerala, where there is high demand for this fruit. 

The demand stems from the fact that Kerala, being one of the hottest ayurvedic products and wellness resorts’ destination, gooseberry or amla as it is referred to, is the most needed ingredient in those preparations. 

Hence, the tribals, who usually run out of jobs in winter, collect gooseberries, in groups, with each group procuring few kgs of berries everyday, for a small sum from Moolehole zone and Balle in Nagarahole. 

This will pose a problem pertaining to food to the wild animals such as deer, monkeys, squirrel and wild boars which depend on easily available fruits such as berries, say the wildlife experts.
