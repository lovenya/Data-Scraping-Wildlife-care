The critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB) is likely to be included in the global list of top 10 migratory species facing extinction under the UNEP's Convention for Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) of Wild Animals, the environment ministry announced on Monday.ADVERTISEMENTThe step would be taken at the 13th conference of parties (COP 13) to be hosted by India from February 15-22, which will enable range countries to protect and conserve the Great Indian Bustard.The birds are dying at the rate of 15 per cent annually due to collision with high-voltage power lines. Their present population is nearly 150, reduced by 75 per cent in the last 30 years."In this COP, India is proposing three species for inclusion in the CMS Appendix and for concerted action. The three species are Asiatic Elephant, Great Indian Bustard and Bengal Florican. In addition to these, India is also proposing Gangetic Dolphin and Irrawaddy Dolphins for concerted action," a ministry official said.The theme of COP13 is 'Migratory species connect the planet and we welcome them home' and its mascot is the Great Indian Bustard.The ministry said, CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these species, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them."The Government of India has been taking necessary actions to protect and conserve migratory marine species. Species that include Dugong, Whale Shark, Marine Turtle (two species), have been identified for preparation of Conservation and Recovery Action Plan," the ministry said.India is home to several migratory species of wildlife including snow leopard, Amur falcons, bar headed Geese, black necked cranes, marine turtles, dugongs, humpbacked whales among others."India has signed non-legally binding MoU with CMS on conservation and management of Siberian Cranes (1998), Marine Turtles (2007), Dugongs (2008) and Raptors (2016)," the official said.CMS COP 13 will be held in Gandhinagar, Gujarat which will see participation of over 130 countries and 1,800 individuals.
