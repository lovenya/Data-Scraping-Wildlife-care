Government sources said Wednesday that S.K. Nanda, principal secretary of forest and environment department, filed the affidavit tendering an unconditional apology after the court questioned a notification of 2008 related to mining activities. Â 

The development comes after a single judge bench of Justice R.R. Tripathi took the state administration to task and sought its explanation for issuing a notification which was contrary to the directions of the Supreme Court.

The apex court directed that an area of up to one kilometre from the periphery of wild life sanctuaries and national parks be treated as eco-fragile area and be barred for mining.

Param Udhyog, a firm which had a licence and lease for mining near Palanpur-Ambaji road, has approached the court claiming that it was not issued a NoC even after producing all relevant documents. The matter is listed to come up Thursday.ADVERTISEMENT
