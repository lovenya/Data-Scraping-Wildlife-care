The waterfall comes under Someshwara wildlife range. This is second water fall of the same river, first one being Kudlu Theertha.  Theertha literally means holy water in Kannada language.

After getting down at Kalthoor-Santhekatte in Brahmavar, one need to travel/walk for seven kilometres to reach the spot. The walk will not be very tiring owing to a nice kaccha road (mud road) which is wide and well maintained. The walk to the spot is also a wonderful experience as the region is covered with trees on all sides. One can also hear nice ‘tunes’ from the birds on the trees. The cold crystal clear water amidst forest and between rocks would dissuade anyone from getting into the water. Once you reach the spot, the gushing of the water will shadow the shrill sound of creatures and other noises around you. As the water falls on the rocks, enjoying its sprinkle is a wonderful experience. A visit to the enchanting Jomlu Theertha water- falls amidst the dense forest on the Western Ghats will linger in your mind for a long time.

 Such is its beauty, charm, and mesmerising impact. The river Sita slowly flows its way through the Western Ghats and cascades itself at Jomlu Theertha. Those who would like to get closer to the waterfalls, the authorities have created an iron ladder to the waterfalls and one can enjoy the sprinkling of the water.

One cannot see the falls during monsoon as it gets nearly covered in the flowing river water. Though the State government has put up a sign board not to litter, tourists who visit the region have been throwing plastic bags, bottles at the spot. One has to be careful while walking on the rocks leading to the falls as they are slippery. One should avoid swimming in the falls as it is too dangerous and many have lost their lives in the region. As food is not available anywhere near the waterfalls, one need to carry food and enjoy eating while sitting on the rocks.

On the Ellu amavasya (an auspicious day in the Hindu calendar) day, thousands of people throng this place to take bath under the waterfalls. So get ready to visit Jomlutheertha after the monsoon.
