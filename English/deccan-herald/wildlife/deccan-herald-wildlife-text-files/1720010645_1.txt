Informing this to press persons here on Monday, the CNC President N U Nachappa said the officials are creating unnecessary confusion by denying traditional gun right to Kodavas.
“On one hand the officials are behaving unreasonably and on the other hand the Kodava leaders are not convincing the government properly regarding the gun rights of Kodavas. Due to this the officials are creating confusions for the past 50 years,” he said.

This will be protested by forming a human chain at the General Thimmaiah Circle in the City on October 16 following which a memorandum will be submitted to the Deputy Commissioner, he informed.

Nachappa said the demand for Kodava Land is also one of the main demands. 
The gun license is being denied in the pretext of conservation of wildlife. But Kodavas have never misused their weapons, he said.

The awareness meetings demanding Kodava Land will be continued in future too, he said.
Kaliyanda Prakash, C Janath, N Ravisubbaiah, Apparanda Venu were present.
