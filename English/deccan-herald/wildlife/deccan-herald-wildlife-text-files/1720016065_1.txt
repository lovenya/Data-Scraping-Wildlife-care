Besides, the Organising Committee also decided to set up an animal helpline to provide quick assistance in catching them. “Around 150 stray dogs were caught in Games Village alone in the last two days”, said an official from Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), who was deputed to attend to the problems.  

The organisers are also worried about the arrival of packs of wild monkeys in the Games Village. To end the monkey menace, authorities have pressed trained langoors into service. 
The MCD has so far hired 30 trained langoors, who go around games venues and scare away the monkeys. Besides, they have also deputed 20 teams of monkey catchers in various places. 

As langoors are noted for their brilliance and aggression and are highly effective in deterring other animals, the MDC officials believe that tamed primates would help solve this problem. “I am on Commonwealth duty,” beamed Jaspal Singh, owner of a trained langoor, while taking his pet to patrol in the Games venue behind Rashtrapathi Bhavan.  

Native of Bhopal, Jaspal and his family has 43 langurs and offer their services on a monthly basis to scare away monkeys. According to him, the Games have brought a boon as over 25 langoors of his family have been hired by the organisers. Tribals from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have also brought their tamed langurs to Delhi. 

To catch snakes, teams from Wildlife SOS have also been deployed in games venues. Recent monsoon rain has caused flooding near the Games Village causing many snakes to seek refuge inside the accommodations.
