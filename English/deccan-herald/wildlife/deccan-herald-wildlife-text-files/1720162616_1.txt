Residents of Mudgai village in Khanapur taluk, which comes under the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary, on Thursday informed Forest department officials that they had cited another tiger in the village at the same place where a woman was killed by a big cat recently.

ADVERTISEMENTHowever, rejecting the residents’ claims, the Forest department officials said that the phobia of the tiger, that was killed, still exists among the people.

Residents could have cited leopards, which are in large numbers and sometimes come out of the forests chasing their prey. 

“One of them may have been mistaken for a tiger,” they added. However, leopards, till date, haven’t attacked humans in this forest.

Anjana Appanna Hanbar, 23, a resident of Mudgai, was attacked and killed by a man-eater tiger on December 24. The tiger, which was captured in the forests of Chikkamagaluru district on November 17 and released in the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary on November 19, was killed under ‘Operation Tiger’ on December 29.
