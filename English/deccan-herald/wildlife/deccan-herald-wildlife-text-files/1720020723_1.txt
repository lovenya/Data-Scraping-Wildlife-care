Both these fests had fun-filled events with just one aim in mind — to spread awareness. 
This year, the ‘JAAM Week’ took up the theme of AIDS and even raised money for children affected by HIV. 

The  first day of ‘JAAM Week’ saw the association release a booklet which contained information about them. 

This was then followed by a candle light vigil on MG Road. “We wanted to show our respect for those who departed because of this disease,” said Nigel, a second-year student, who took part in the ‘JAAM Week’. 

The following day, the team brought all the associations of the college on the ground and formed a huge AIDS symbol. 

“There were more than 120 students on the ground. This was the first time we have done something like this. It was lots of fun and it also showed our unity and stand towards the cause,” said Aleksandra, a student.   

On the final day, the college was abuzz with activities. While ‘JAAM Week’ hosted a food festival to collect funds for the children affected with HIV, the students of ‘WAAC’ kickstarted their first fest, ‘Wild’. 

“This being the Association’s first fest, we thought of starting off with simple events like photography exhibition-cum-competition, debate, essay writing and quiz. We were raising awareness for the ‘Save the Tiger’ project and we even included the theme in all the events,” said Sherene, a student, who is part of ‘WAAC’. 

From innovative posters and banners decorating the college hallways to even installing small flags, carrying information about the themes on various food items, students let their creative juices flow to ensure that the message is passed on.

“Instead of always talking about such issues and hoping for some change in the attitude of the people, we wanted to ensure that the change began with us. And such fests help us achieve that,” said Nigel.
