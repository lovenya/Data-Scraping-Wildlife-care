Then I took a two year sabbatical and decided to pursue my passion of regional food. I grew up in the same area all my life and my neighbour Vishal, who is a Mangalorean, shared my passion. Which led to the opening of Bengaluru Oota Company (BOC) five years ago.Both in the kitchens and the management side of the hospitality industry, women are not that common. This is in contrast with homes, where the kitchen is considered the woman’s domain Why do you think that is?It’s a general trend across industries in the country that there is a lower percentage of women, probably one of the lowest in the world. I think everyone looks at women working as a secondary income and a lot of women don’t have an opportunity to build a skill set for a profession or get educated for it. In BOC, 70 per cent of our workforce is women. We’ve taken women without professional training to be in a commercial kitchen, women who have a passion for and understanding of local cuisine. Do you think more women in leadership positions translate to more women in the workforce?I don’t know, but this is something that I’m passionate about. I’ve wanted more women in the workforce because they need more opportunities. This is something that I want to focus on in my future projects as well. What’s it like being a woman in this field?I’ve never been told that because I’m a woman I can’t do certain things so I’ve never looked at it from that lens. There are certain advantages to being a woman though and I think I’ve made full use of that. Chef Nirata KarJunior Sous Chef, Renaissance Bengaluru Race Course HotelTell me about your journey. What drew you to food?As a kid I was awestruck by the idea of how the raw ingredients would turn into delicious preparations. I started experimenting with food when I was in first grade. Gradually my love for food and cooking grew deeper.What are your thoughts on the lack of women chefs?It’s sad that we relate food to gender specific roles. Like if it’s a homemade food it has to be made by a mother or a grand mom, likewise when we go to hotels or restaurants we naturally expect it to be a male chef. Working in hotels for long hours and late nights was an impossible thought, it still is for many.Hence the dominance of men in the profession. It’s high time we understand that being a chef has nothing to do with gender, it should be counted on the grounds of passion and talent.There are challenges only when the society underestimates the power of a woman. Sometimes we are expected to be a submissive assistant in the kitchen rather than being a leader.What advice would you give to aspiring women chefs?My advice would be to forget your gender when you wear that chef coat on. Be inquisitive, hardworking and a go-getter.Quick 5 Q’sFavourite food: Homemade pork momoFavourite dish to make: Chilly Pork with bamboo shootA chef you look up to: Chef Nina TarasovaIf you weren’t a chef, then: Volunteer in an animal conservation/ wildlifesafariDream food destination: ParisChef Bhavana GovardhaneDemi Chef De Partie at Courtyard by Marriott Bengaluru HebbalTell me about your journey. What drew you to food?I think it is a combination of my will to do something creative and my love for cooking and feeding people. I realised this after I made the first ever cake for my parents on their anniversary when I was 15, it was an alphonso cake, and my parents couldn’t stop appreciating it. After that my interest only grew and it became my passion.What are your thoughts on the lack of women chefs?According to me, there is no such division and there shouldn’t be. But of course, presently, there are more men in the industry than women, but I am sure there will be more women coming into this industry. For women in this field, the only challenge that comes is when they have to compete with the mentality of men in the hot environment at the kitchen. But now men should be alert, because we are ready to face anything that comes our way. What advice would you give to aspiring women chefs?Stop doubting yourself and be the best at whatever you do so that no one can put you down. Always take up every challenge that comes your way, even if you fail, get up and give it another chance.Quick 5 Q’sFavourite food: BiryaniFavourite dish to make: MacaroonsA chef you look up to: Vinesh Johny  If you weren’t a chef, what would you be: social activistDream food destination: France, as the hospitality industry originated in France and I would like to know more about food culture and food trends.Chef Napharphak Pompraksa Masterchef, Thai cuisine, The Oberoi BengaluruTell me about your journey. What drew you to food?As a young girl I grew up in a large household bustling with people and visitors. Food was integral to our hospitality and sense of home. It drew me to learn the art of cooking good food that not only fills your appetite but satiates the soul too.What are your thoughts on the lack of women chefs?The scale of operations in a commercial kitchen, its pressures of long hours, stress and logistics often deters women from becoming long standing players in this field. But, the situation is changing.With support from organisations for greater work-life balance, their own families and the sense of self for a lot of women, the representation is slowly becoming better than what it was five to ten years ago.What advice would you give to aspiring women chefs?You must love what you do, practice it not like your job but like a life skill which you take seriously.Stay focused, reach out for help when you need it, be self-assertive when desired and most of all be patient and keep learning.Quick 5 Q’sFavourite food: Thai style noodles with spicy soup.Favourite dish to make: Grilled fish/seafood are my favourite as it’s healthy, flavourful and delicious, all at the same time.A chef you look up to: Chef Lookchun from Thailand.If you weren’t a chef, then: A teacher / professor.
