On April 16, the ministry cancelled the environmental clearance accorded to three 150 MW coal-based thermal power units, which were to come up in the  Hankon village of Karwar taluk in Uttar Kanada district.

Exactly a month later, the CRZ approval given in 2008 for the construction of coal unloading wharf, conveyers for transferring coal and other raw materials and the proposed water pipelines was withdrawn by the ministry. In a strongly worded letter to the project proponent Ind-Bharath Power (Karwar) Ltd, the ministry accused the company of hiding vital information such as the distance between the Cotiago wildlife sanctuary in Goa and the project site.

The CRZ approval was accorded on March 4, 2008. But within days of the approval, the ministry was flooded with complaints on how inaccurate data was furnished suppressing the project’s proximity to the wildlife sanctuary and inevitable destruction of mangroves, to get the nod.

A three-member examination committee was set up to look into the matter. It found that the site is within 5 km of the sanctuary. After receiving the expert committee report, which indicts the company, in last August, the ministry decided to review the entire project.
A joint expert appraisal committee visited the site and discussed the contentious issues with the local population, company officials and the district administration. The appraisal committee corroborated the fact that the company was at fault for not disclosing the site’s correct distance from the park.

Other key information concealed by the company was linked to the location of discharge of cooling water, impact of intake and out fall on the fisheries and the presence of patches of dense forests, including mangroves, in and around the project site.ADVERTISEMENT
