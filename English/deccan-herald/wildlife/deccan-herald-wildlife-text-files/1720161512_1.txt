The officials of the Forest department have confirmed that, Anjana Appanna Hanba, 23, who was suspected to have been killed by a wild animal on Wednesday, was indeed mauled to death by a tiger.

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to the officials, it is the same tiger that was released last month into the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Khanapur taluk. 

Anjana, a resident of Mudagai village near Jamboti in Khanapur taluk, was killed by the big cat when she went to fetch water. Her body was found about a km away from the spot.

Ambady Madhav, deputy conservator of forests, said that though the big cat had a radio collar, the department personnel were unable to track its exact location due to problems with information transmission. He added that the family of the victim will be given a compensation of Rs five lakh. 

Shooting orders
Madhav also stated that orders have been issued to shoot the man-eater. 
Earlier on Thursday, the tiger reportedly killed a horse at Dorli village, a few kilometre from Mudagai.

Meanwhile, MLA Arvind Patil, residents from surrounding villages staged a protest against the Forest department for not capturing the tiger. They said that they would not cremate the victim’s body unless the department killed or captured the tiger. 

Protest turns violent
The protest got violent after a few irate villagers tried to manhandle the police and the Forest department officials.  Arvind Patil and Additional Superintendent of Police Nyamgoudar were also not spared. 

A few police and Forest personnel suffered injuries in the melee. MP Prakash Hukkeri, who was also present on the occasion, tried to pacify the angry villagers.
