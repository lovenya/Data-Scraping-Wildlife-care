As I reached Nainital, a cool breeze woke me up from my deep slumber. I opened my eyes to a dreamy vista — a vast lake surrounded by a ring of hills. I stood there, spellbound, and after a while, I checked into a  hotel.

Perched at an altitude of 1,930 metres, Nainital is a tailor-made destination for tourists. It is pristine nature in all its glory — beautiful lakes, mountains, vantage points and wildlife. Like any other popular hill station, there are many places to see in Nainital. To soak up the local culture, I decided to explore the place on foot. The morning being still young, it was a perfect time to take a look at the Himalayan peaks from the famed Snow View Point. The aerial ropeway is surely an enjoyable way of going up the mountain, known as Sher ka Danda or Tiger’s Ridge. Sitting in the cable car, as I went higher, the town became smaller to the eye, dominated by the emerald lake, reflecting the green of the tall pines surrounding it.

The shape of an eye that the lake had assumed made me wonder if this was what gave the place its name (Nain in Hindi means eye). But my guide explained quickly that Nainital is named so because, according to a legend, an eye of Sati (Parvathi, also worshipped as Nainadevi) had fallen here while she was being carried by Shiva. 

At the viewpoint, we were rewarded with a panoramic view of the Himalayas and its towering peaks Nanda Devi, Nandakot and Trishul. The next attraction was the Govind Ballabh Pant High Altitude Zoo, named after the great statesman. What makes this place unique is that one gets to see rare mammals like the snow leopard, Siberian tiger and a variety of pheasants. Also, a boating excursion on the lake is a must-do. Late afternoons are ideal for the same. The vivid array of boats lends charm to the scenery. Little wonder that Nainital is a honeymooners’ paradise. 

Spread around Nainital in close proximity are many more lakes, which is why it is also known as the lake district. I decided to visit most of them. Sat Tal, the first I arrived at, is an amalgamation of seven small lakes. On the other hand, Bhimtal  has an island which houses an aquarium and a restaurant. The last lake I visited was Naukuchia Tal with seven corners. On my way back, I paid a visit to Hanuman Garhi. A tall statue of Hanuman, standing on a ridge, greeted me. The view of the valley, soaked in golden light, left me in awe. 

Back in Nainital, it was time for a stroll on Mall Road. Walking alongside colonial-styled buildings, hotels and eateries, informed me a lot about the local culture. As night fell, the hills around the lake turned into silhouettes and the colourful neon lights cast columns of reflections on the lake. A sight to behold, indeed.ADVERTISEMENT
