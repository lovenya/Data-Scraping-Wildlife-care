Come February, the Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens in the city will have an incinerator with shredder technology to cremate dead animals. 

ADVERTISEMENT“Once the Rs 30.91-lakh facility is operational, the Mysore zoo will be the first in the State to have an advanced system for the cremation of its dead animals,” said zoo executive director B P Ravi . A site measuring 40x60 feet, near the compost yard, will be used as the location of the eco-friendly facility. 

When the new facility is up and ready, the zoo will fall under compliance of Central Zoo Authority rules. According to the rules, framed in 1992, every large and medium zoo in the country should be equipped with an incinerator. “Another rule makes it mandatory to cremate dead animals,” Ravi said. 

Poisonous gas produced at the incineration of the dead animals will be diluted with water, mixed with chemicals, that is passed through a dedicated point in the incinerator. 

Elaborating on the carcass-disposal system currently employed, the officer said that large animals and birds, classified under Schedule I of wildlife, are cremated using firewood. 

On average, some 400 kgs of firewood is required to cremate a dead tiger. Dead elephants are usually buried in forest areas.
