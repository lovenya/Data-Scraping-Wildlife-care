The book written by S P Nagendra, noted wildlife photographer was on Thursday released by Home Minister V S Acharya who praised the author and his photographic abilities. 

“Such beautiful and serene pictures have indeed been a pleasure to watch,” said Acharya after a tour of the exhibit. Acharya said: “Man is a product of nature. The presence of something precious is felt only when it is absent. Such is the situation of our wildlife history. 

Looking at the pictures we should understand the importance of preserving our wildlife,” said the Home Minister.

Plea to be forwarded

On behalf of the Government, Acharya said the plea by the people to honour Nagendra with the Rajyotsava Award will be forwarded by him to the Rajyotsava Committee. “This apart, we will also try and place a copy of “Wild Witness” for the common man in every public library possible and also install his beautiful pictures on the walls of Vidhana Soudha,” he promised.
