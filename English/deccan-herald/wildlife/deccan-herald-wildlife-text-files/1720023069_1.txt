Madan Naik (54), Assistant conservator of forests (ACF), who was posted in Dandeli, was allegedly assaulted by a government employee and his friends and relatives on Sunday afternoon, when he tried to stop the group from feeding crocodiles on the banks of the Kali River. 

Arvind Chavan, an employee of the Dandeli City Municipal Council (CMC), was partying at a homestay with his companions at a nearby farm, spread across four acres. Bagalkot Sub -Inspector S R Naik, an assistant sub-inspector, a lady teacher and an assistant work engineer were said to be Chavan’s companions.

Madan Naik, who was visiting the Dandelappa temple near the river along with his family, reportedly came across the partying group, who were said to be in an inebriated condition, feeding the reptiles.

He tried to dissuade them as feeding wild crocodiles is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. Angered by his intervention, the group allegedly attacked Naik and hit on his head with a huge rock. Naik’s wife Sumathi, his son and two daughters who tried to come to his rescue, were also targeted by the group.

Naik was rushed to the Dharmasthala hospital in Dharwad, where he passed away at 11:30 pm on Tuesday. The last rites were performed at Belekeri in Ankola taluk on Wednesday. 

A complaint has been registered at the Dandeli Rural police station against six people. Four – Anand Roopsingh Nayak, Suresh Sankrappa Nayak, Prashanth Rama Lamani and Arvind Chavan - have been arrested. Two others are absconding.

Forest Minister C P Yogeeshwara has ordered a CID probe into the incident. 
On Wednesday evening, a mob set fire to one of the cottages of a homestay on the farm. Citizens staged a dharna in front of the Dandeli police station demanding that the accused including Sub-Inspector Naik be arrested.
