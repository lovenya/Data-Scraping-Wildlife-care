Dr S V Narasimhan, a medical practitioner in Virajpet in Kodagu district, is perhaps better known as a bird enthusiast. An avid bird watcher, he has been carrying out an awareness campaign with focus on conservation for the past three decades. 

As part of the initiative, every year he sends hand-painted cards to over 1,000 people across the world. The card consists of meticulous painting of a bird or an animal with information about it, and conservation messages. 

Here are some sample messages — “ We co-exist, can’t you?” by a tiger and a spotted deer; “It was we who filled the world with melodious music,” by common iora bird.

Narasimhan feels that all creatures are equally important for the survival of life on earth. He chose this signature campaign to motivate people to think about environment and our roles in conserving it. These wildlife message cards are individually handpainted and sent  to people across the world, free of cost, during the wildlife week every year. In the last 32 years, he has painted 62,420 cards. 

This year alone, he painted 1,930 cards. In the process, he has painted more than 480 species of animals, birds and butterflies. One of his messages said, “Let us join hands to make our earth a greener place to live. This is the only place where all the elements of life can live in health, happiness and harmony.” He has also authored a bilingual book (Kannada and English) on birds called Feathered Jewels of Coorg.
