The dead birds were found over a 2-km area in Beebe on Friday night, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said.

It has been speculated that the flock could have been hit by lightning or high-altitude hail, Commission ornithologist Karen Rowe was quoted as saying by Arkansas Online.

Another reason cited for the death of birds was the new year's eve revellers shooting off fireworks in the area which could have startled the birds from their roost and caused them to die from stress.

To determine what caused the death, 65 birds have been sent to the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission lab and the National Wildlife Health Centre lab in Wisconsin.ADVERTISEMENT
