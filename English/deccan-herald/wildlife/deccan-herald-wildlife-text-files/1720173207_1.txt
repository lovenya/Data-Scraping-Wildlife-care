Happy birthday, birdie! The world's 'oldest' penguin has turned 36 years old in the UK - a staggering 108 in human years.

ADVERTISEMENTKing penguin Missy was brought to the Birdland wildlife park in Gloucestershire, UK, when she was at least five years old in 1982.

Despite losing the vision in one eye, Missy is still the leader of her colony.

In spite of its age, her keepers had no idea that she was the world's oldest until a zoo in Denmark claimed the title with a Gentoo penguin two years younger than Missy.

Staff at the park are planning to send her details to Guinness World Records to prove her claim to the title, 'Daily Express' reported.

King penguins – Aptenodytes patagonicus – are only expected to live up to 26 years in captivity, much more than their 15-20 years life expectancy in the wild.

Missy spends most of her time with her partner, Seth, who is supposed to be 34 years old and was a part of the 1992 flick Batman Returns.

"The Danish zoo recently announced they believed that a Gentoo penguin there was the world's oldest living penguin having reached the age of 34 in May. Although we cannot categorically age Missy we do know she was an adult when she came to Birdland and king penguins take five years to become fully mature," Simon Blackwell, park manager, said.

"Therefore she must be, at the very least, 36 and she could actually be significantly older," said Blackwell.

"We believe she is the oldest penguin in the world and we are planning to look into applying to Guinness World Records," he said.
