The lifting of water from River Bhadra illegally, using a submersible pump and motor pumps has been unveiled at Balehonnur and Khandya in the district.

ADVERTISEMENTThe water is being lifted to supply water to the coffee estates and agriculture fields.
Fall in water levelThe installation of motor pumps on the banks of the river has resulted in the depleting of water-level. With peak summer fast approaching, the wild animals and birds will depend heavily on river water to quench their thirst. The village forest committee members of Khandya, Hebbe, Lakkavalli as well as wildlife and nature lovers alleged that the owners of the submersible pump are lifting from the river water illegally throughout the day. The inflow of water to River Bhadra has declined. The authorities concerned should initiate action against defaulters, they demanded.

Trouble for fauna

The village forest committee members P Santhosh, Naveen Kumar and others said that the decline in water level will affect wild animals. “There are all possibilities of wild animals entering villages in search of water with the decline in water in River Bhadra,” they warned.
The members alleged that the resort and home stay owners are also engaged in lifting water from the river illegally. The Deputy Commissioner and Revenue Department and Mescom officials should confiscate the illegal pump sets and initiate strict action against the defaulters.
