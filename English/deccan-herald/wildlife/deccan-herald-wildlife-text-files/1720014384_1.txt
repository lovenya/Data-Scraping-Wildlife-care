The porky kookaburra weighed in at 565 grams, nearly 40 per cent heavier than a normal adult bird, rendering her so unfit she couldn’t fly.

“Out in the wild she’d eat a whole small animal such as a mouse, but butcher’s sausages are just too much of a good thing,” said Gemma Watkinson, Sydney’s Taronga Zoo wildlife hospital nurse.

A Sydney resident brought the bird to the zoo after spotting dogs chasing her along the ground.

“The kookaburra’s been down at the rehabilitation aviary for a couple of weeks on a special ‘lite n’ easy’ diet designed by our bird keeper,” said Watkinson.

Following a rigorous exercise regime up to three times a day with a personal trainer, the kookaburra is winning her battle of the bulge, but still a little more weight to shed before being ready to be returned to her native habitat.

“We’ve fitted the temporary home out like a ‘bird gym’,” said Watkinson.ADVERTISEMENT
