"A proposal is being sent to the Centre requesting for sanction of a corridor connecting forests in the three states, which will help increase tiger population," Field Director Paritosh Upadhaya told PTI here today.

"We have also proposed to make the 10 km radius around the 1026 square km Reserve as an eco-sensitive zone," he said.Tiger census had taken place in 60 percent of Reserve area, which had put the big cat's population at six, he said, adding, another census will be taken up in the rest of the area soon to ascertain the exact number of the tigers there.
"The Centre for Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, has confirmed the scats sent by us were of six different species of tigers," he said.

In 2007, there were 17 tigers, he said."We have sent another proposal to the government to make arrangements for a three-month training at the Forest Research Institute, Dehradoon for field officers and employees of the forest department," Upadhaya said.
The Reserve has only one wildlife expert based in Latehar's Chhipadohar and it required more experts, he said.ADVERTISEMENT
