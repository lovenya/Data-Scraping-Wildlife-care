The court was hearing a petition filed by A N Karthik, P Manjunath and others, who had moved the High Court stating that the Netrani island, also known as ‘Pigeon Island’, is a proposed biodiversity heritage site with rich diversity of coral reefs and good diversity of flora and fauna.

This spot was being used for target practice, which is affecting the biodiversity of the region and might result in loss of rich and rare biodiversity, the petitioners contended. According to the petitioners, the island, situated nine nautical miles from Bhatkal and 19 km from Murudeshwar, is home to rare birds like white-bellied sea eagle and edible nest swiftlets. 

Stating that the island was home to several species protected under Schedule One of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, B R Deepak, counsel for the petitioners, cited the report of a survery conducted by Karnataka Biodiversity Board in the early 2000s.

He said, “The heart-shaped island was covered with hard coral (14.7 per cent), sponges (2.7 per cent), algae (63.2 per cent), boring polychaetes (13.3 per cent) and mussel (0.3 per cent). This is the first report of existence of small giant clams from the West Coast of India. The coral ecosystem is very rich here, so is the diversity of fish,” the petition said.

The petitioners said that despite several requests and pleas made to the defence minister, secretaries and even the Western Naval Command head, the threat to the island continued. 

The Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Vikramjit Sen and Justice A S Bopanna ordered notice to Indian Navy, Chief of Naval Staff, Minister for Defence, Ministry for Environment and Forests, Karnataka State Bio Diversity Board and others.
