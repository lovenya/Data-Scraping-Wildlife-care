The River Koundinya takes its birth in Kurudumale village and further flows to Palamaneru at Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh and proceeds to the Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary. Due to land aquisition and lack of rainfall, the river dried up several years back and is almost untraceable.

Convention

Some scheduled caste families of this village do not celebrate Ugadi. A day before Ugadi and a week thereafter people do not take a bath. Those women who are married and have left the village come back just to observe this ceremony.

Out of the 90 houses in the village, as many as 60 houses do not observe Ugadi.

Legend

The Ugadi tradition dates back to a belief among the Harijan families that if they celebrate the festival, they will be hunted by disaster. This belief has been strengthened by tragedies which have taken place on this day: it could be falling from trees, accidents or even a bizarre occurrence.

About a hundred years ago a pregnant woman was returning from the village tank with a pot of water when a bull struck her womb with its horns, killing her and her child instantly. Villagers say this incident took place on Ugadi.

Lining on walls

The residents of Harijan Colony draw a line around their house with cow dung, indicating that they are not celebrating.

The residents begin their mourning period a week ahead of the festival, and end it a week later. During this period, they don’t bathe, wear new clothes, comb their hair, women don’t wear bindis, neither do they take up new ventures. They also keep away from routine work, ponds and trees. 

The entire colony celebrates Ugadi on Ramanavami, which marks the end of the mourning period for the woman who was gored to death.
