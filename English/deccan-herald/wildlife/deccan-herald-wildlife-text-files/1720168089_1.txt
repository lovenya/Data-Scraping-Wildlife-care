The Forest department’s plan to clear a part of the green in Churchegudda Reserve Forest near Arishinaguppe regional zone to develop ‘Nedu Thopu’ (grove of saplings) has come under flak with environmentalists crying hoarse.

ADVERTISEMENTThe green lovers who have called it as a foolish idea, have questioned the rationale behind the same as the fully developed natural forest is being targeted with the only intention of developing greenery.

According to wildlife conservation activist G Veeresh, “The thick vegetation has been already removed with earth moving machines, suffice to say that fence itself is eating the crop. It is a heinous crime as the Forest department tasked with the responsibility of developing forest is throwing rules to the wind.”

The said forest is a habitat of many wild animals like tiger, leopard and deer. According to the law, there is also no provision to cut trees to build a road inside the forest. When this is the reality, the forest personnel are out to implement the plans in a hasty manner, he said.

Veeresh also has a set of posers—What is the necessity of building roads inside the forest? Is it right to develop ‘Nedu Thopu’ inside the forest? Is it right on the part of the authorities to cut  trees without any permission in the reserve forest? Does the Forest department authorised to violate forest laws?

The activist has demanded stern action against the forest officials coming under regional zone and also measures to drop the plan to develop ‘Nedu Thopu’ to save the reserve forest from extinction.
