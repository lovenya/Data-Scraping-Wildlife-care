Sources in the Forest Department told Deccan Herald that many of the visitors, especially foreigners, came to Karnataka because of its rare and amazing flora and fauna. The number of visitors in 2010-2011 would have increased by at least 10 per cent, they said.

Endowed with different types of ecosystems, Karnataka is home to about 4,500 species of flowering plants, 500 species of birds, 70 species of frogs, 800 species of fish and 120 species of reptiles, including some rare and endangered species.

However, the depleting forest cover is posing a threat to many of the species, forcing the government to take up several initiatives for afforestation.

The forested area in the State had drastically reduced by 10 per cent to 21,958 sq km in 2007 compared to 26,156 sq km in 2001. Only 0.93 per cent of the forest cover is “very dense”.

According to the Karnataka Economic Survey, the Ranganathittu Wildlife Sanctuary, which attracts several winged visitors each year, had the highest number of visitors with 2,68,542, of whom 2,62,610 were Indians and 5,932 were from outside. The Shettihalli Wildlife Sanctuary had only 91 visitors. (see table).

In the second place was the Bandipur National Park with a total of 1,63,425 visitors, followed by the Brahmagiri Wildlife Sanctuary with 71,433 visitors and the Kudremukh National Park which attracted 48,285 visitors.

The government has spent Rs 870 lakh on the upkeep of these parks and sanctuaries while it has earmarked Rs 1,200 lakh for the purpose for the year 2010-2011.
