With the expansion of the online world, blogs and podcasts have been becoming increasingly popular among youngsters. Their popularity probably stems from the fact that they cater to specific topics of interest and give the freedom to voice opinions about anything.

Aishwarya Kirit and Anuradha Venkatesh are both avid listeners of BBC Radio 4’s satirical ‘Friday Night Comedy’. Anuradha says, “It offers the latest news spiced with true British humour”. Some people, like Keerthi Shastri, follow news blogs via Facebook and Twitter.

Podcasts about music and celebrities seem to be very popular. Keerthi particularly follows those about Sufi artistes and bands to keep up with their latest songs. She is also tuned to podcasts of TV shows like ‘How I Met Your Mother’, ‘Castle’ and ‘Bones’, that fill in the blanks when she misses any part of the show. The iTunes celebrity playlist podcast also attracts many listeners.

Most prefer lurking around blogs, neither commenting nor hosting a blog of their own. Some, however, enjoy giving and getting feedback for their writing. Pallavi Menon writes a blog titled ‘A Drop in the Ocean’. She values the response to it and the process of writing as well. She says, “I enjoy reading blogs that don’t have too much text, especially witty, humorous ones like ‘Grumpy Comments’.” Aishwarya K sometimes reads fan-fiction blogs when she can find what she is looking for. 

People are more likely to check out blogs of friends, either out of curiosity or at their insistence. Shraddha Sharma only reads blogs by people she knows. She says, “Most of them aren’t great writing, but are about something special to them. This helps me see occasions in different ways and improve my own personal essays.” Her own blog is called ‘As Simple as Can Be’ at foreverreflecting.blogspot.in. “I simply write what comes to my mind about incidents I have come across,” she adds.

Personal blogs tend to revolve around hobbies and interests. This is the case with Anuradha’s blog — ‘Everlasting Vistas’. Those who begin blogging with fervour sometimes burn out and struggle to find the time or inclination to continue. 

Ultimately, the podcasts and blogs that draw our attention are about subjects that fascinate us. For Anuradha V, blogs about Jane Austen, photography, nature, astronomy and sports are the most captivating, along with podcasts like ‘Wildlife Ocean’ and LSE lectures. Aishwarya K is a die-hard ‘Doctor Who’ fan, who satisfies her obsession with related podcasts that analyse every episode. It appears that whatever you crave, there is likely to be a blog or podcast that offers it to
