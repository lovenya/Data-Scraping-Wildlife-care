The State made this submission when the court was hearing petitions by Bush Betta Wildlife Resort Ltd, which has sought directions to the State Forest Department to execute the lease deed.

The State in its submission said that angling of fish (fishingÂ  mahseer) and releasing them back into the river after weighing them is banned.

The resort had challenged the failure of the State and the Central Empowered Committee in renewing the lease for its resort and angling camp on the Cauvery. 

It said in 1997, the State gave permission to operate fishing and angling camp from Mekedatu to Tamil Nadu border across the Cauvery. However, the permission was not renewed. The matter has been adjourned.ADVERTISEMENT
