An eight-year-old male sloth bear which was rescued from a snare laid by poachers, died at the Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Centre late on Saturday night.ADVERTISEMENTThe Forest Department and Wildlife SOS had rescued the bear which was trapped in a snare near a cashew nut plantation in Chikkaballapur forest range. When the rescue team reached the spot, they found the animal struggling to free its a self as a result of which the snare had got entangled around its neck, suffocating the animal. The animal was tranquilised and the snare was cut off.Since the animal had sustained injuries, it was rushed to BBRC, but it died four hours later. Postmortem revealed that the animal had sustained tracheal damage, said Dr Arund A Sha, Director Veterinary Operations, Wildlife SOS.Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS said that the snare was made of clutch cable which is generally used for catching wild boars. This is the third such incident this week where sloth bears have been rescued from snares set up by poachers.
