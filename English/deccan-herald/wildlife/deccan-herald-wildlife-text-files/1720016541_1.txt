Refreshing is one of those. The moods can be numerous - still, reflective, contemplative, soothing, invigorating, playful or musical. Gardening with elements that include water, such as pools, fountains, etc has been around for thousands of years now. 

Different cultures have used it in different ways. Italian grand staircases to still reflective pools of Mughals, English countryside ponds to Moorish courtyard fountains – the legacy presents an amazing array of possibilities. Even today, the same fundamentals apply and with little imagination and appropriate design, nothing completes a getaway within a home than a water body. 

Examine the practicalities and aesthetics of the space. Have absolute clarity about what you want to achieve. Water features may serve several purposes. 

For you, will it be a pure sensory experience, an artistic expression, a foil for surrounding noise, a wildlife haven to shelter frogs, fish, turtles, etc. Once you have identified the mood you desire, decide the style. 

The style of any feature is greatly dictated by the surroundings, whether they are natural, architectural or both. Success lies in harmony between the building and the feature. In case of smaller areas, the interior style will significantly influence the decision. 
A skilfully achieved transition can allow a radically different creation too. It can be anything from classic to contemporary to eclectic; it is just a matter of your taste and the designer’s imagination. 

Location will depend on the purpose the feature will serve. However, the water feature cannot be in isolation to the practicalities of electricity supply and water source to top it up. 

Whether using a prefabricated pond or digging into the ground and lining it with pond liner or constructing above ground – it is ultimately anything that can hold water but ruled by aesthetics and practicality. 

Size will be determined primarily by site constraints though small spaces may turn impressive if the feature can be created bigger, of high quality but still simple. In such a case, it serves as a focal point and needs to be treated like that. Luxury of space can allow streams, ponds, lakes or waterfalls. 

Whereas smaller spaces can create waterwalls, use stand-alone fountains or suitable containers dressed with plants or life or just appropriate accessories and lighting. 
To support living things, surface area as well as depth counts. In general, a bigger feature tends to be more practical, especially if it supports any form of life. Besides increased aesthetic benefits, it is far more stable in terms of temperature changes and microscopic life. 

Safety matters

Safety is an important consideration. Some degree of danger exists no matter how shallow the water is. Danger increases with dimensions and use of electricity. Deep features may use fencing, ledge slope, or very gradual slopes. In a natural setting, a transition planting layer deters access to depth and may also hide the fencing. Electricity for running support machinery and lighting can be safely provided by following guidelines. 

The reflective and transparent physical nature of water allows for an interesting interplay with light. Depending on the surface finish of the feature, amazing creations are possible. Dark pools reflect the sky and trees while an appropriately lit vertical water surface may shimmer even in the darkest hour. 

Reflective or shiny, drama can be created easily by playing with various finishes. Dawns and dusks are especially magical on water. In dark patches, the placement can tap natural or artificial light and brighten it indirectly. 

Plants, fish, frogs, snails or even birds come easily to water, depending on the environment created. Deter mosquito larvae by moving water, using natural predators like fish, toads, dragonfly, or simply by keeping it clean. 

To support life, sunlight is essential. At least half a day of  sunlight should shine upon the surface. That also means growth of ugly algae. To counter that, a 30-40 per cent surface cover by floating plants is useful. Growing underwater plants keeps algae from thriving and so does low nutrition. Some more options are also out there to keep algae in check. 
Generally, plants and fish do not like disturbance in water and keeping those thriving in moving water takes great expertise. A wide variety of plant habitat is available under aquatic and bog plants. The silhouettes reflect amazingly - remember the famous weeping willow and lily pond painting by Claude Monet. 

If there is scope, plant directly or grow in containers kept under water. 
Choice will always depend on the light, depth and wind conditions. Flowering plants, swaying grass plumes, or even carnivorous plants...take your pick. Flower varieties such as water lilies need at least six hours of sun while lotus needs depth. Papyrus cannot stand windy conditions, while floating lettuce will just ride the ripples. 

For those who show love to tend plants by over-watering them, a win-win situation is using plants that sit happily in water. These plants thrive in the transition zone between all water and well-drained land; therefore they work perfectly in wet pots. 

Like Cyperus, colacasia, aster, campanula, carnivorous plants, gunnera, hosta, iris, 
zantedeschia, and many more. 

Water gardening is just whole another refreshing experience. The entire garden can evolve around water or water can complete the garden. What beckons you?ADVERTISEMENT
