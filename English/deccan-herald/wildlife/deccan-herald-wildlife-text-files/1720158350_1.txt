Long-term scientific research has revealed that the man-eating tiger captured by the Forest department on December 5 has an interesting ecological history.

ADVERTISEMENTWildlife Conservation Society (WCS) scientists led by Dr Ullas Karanth, who have maintained a photographic database of tigers, identified the tiger as the one that was camera-trapped several times between 2004 and 2013. The male tiger, which WCS has named BPT-117, was first camera-trapped at Dodda Dasana Katte Road, Moleyur range, on March 30, 2004. At that time, it was assessed to be about three years old. Subsequently, the tiger was camera-trapped 10 times, during 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013. The last photographic capture was on May 11, 2013 on Sollegundi Road, Gundre range. 

The area where the tiger was camera-trapped is about 33 sq km. From the locations of the recent human attacks, which are on the edges of this tiger’s range, it appears that this big cat was evicted from his range after May 2013, by a more vigorous rival.

“Forced to the edges of the forest to survive, the tiger may have been compelled to kill livestock and, at some point sensing their vulnerability, attack three human victims. Such deliberate stalking and killing of humans has been rare in this region, despite there being a large tiger population of 150. The last proven case of man-eating was that of our study animal, tigress NHT-111, around Nagarahole in 2006. She was a 13-year old female who killed livestock, dogs and finally hunted down two humans,” said Karanth. 

High-density of tigers

WSC’s research shows that the Bandipur-Nagarahole tiger population is at a high density of 10-15 tigers/100 sq km. Because of the high rate of reproduction, based on an abundant prey base, this population naturally has high mortality and losses amounting to 20 per cent per year. 

“Such mortalities are more likely among sub-adults trying to find new territories, and among old, weak ones which are evicted from their home ranges. BPT-117 is one such old tiger evicted from its territory. The tiger it is said would not have lasted much longer in the wild,” added Karanth.
