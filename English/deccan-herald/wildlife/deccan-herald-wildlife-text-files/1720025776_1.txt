One more sloth bear, Kundan, 18, died of human tuberculosis at the Bear Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre (BRRC) at Bannerghatta Biological Park here on Monday.

Dr Arun A Sha, wildlife veterinarian at BRRC, said unlike other bears which had refused to eat, Kundan was doing fine and was on a regular diet. 

“I was treating another affected bear and Kundan suddenly collapsed in the neighbouring enclosure. I rushed there, administered emergency medicines and conducted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but in vain. 

The bear died due to respiratory arrest,” he said. A post mortem revealed a chronic infection in the lungs where puss had formed into a hard mass, Sha said.

Kundan was shifted from the Purulia bear rescue centre in West Bengal due to Maoist threat in November 2010. The bear was blind when he arrived at Bannerghatta and attempts had been made to treat him for blindness. 

Sha said there were three other bears which were ill and refusing to eat. Kundan is the fourth bear to have died of human tuberculosis mycobacterium tuberculosis. 

The wildlife vets at Bannerghatta are finding it extremely difficult to diagnose and treat TB among sloth bears. 

The Bannerghatta Biological Park, along with the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, has started collecting samples of all the 100-odd sloth bears at the BRRC for comprehensive tests.
