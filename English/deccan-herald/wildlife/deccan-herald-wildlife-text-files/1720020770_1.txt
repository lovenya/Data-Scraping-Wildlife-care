The first event, planned by the publishing house, is a drawing competition, open to all children between 6-12 years, with Forests & Wildlife as the central theme. It will be conducted at Mantri Square Mall, Malleswaram on December 10, from 5 pm to 7 pm. Although walk-ins are welcome, call ahead on 25420925 to register.

 If you are busy with tests and exams, or tuitions and extra classes and cannot make it to the venue, don’t fret. You may scan and email your artworks to info@prathambooks.org before Dec 12. The winning entries will be part of a 2012 calendar that will be unveiled at the grand finale on Dec 24. 

You can also pledge your support to forests and wildlife with catchy slogans, conservation tips and meaningful messages. “The aim is to get 2,00,000 pledges this year. In 2009, during the ‘Water Conservation’ campaign, we got 1,22,000 pledges from children and adults in six Indian languages,” says Purvi Shah, Brand Manager of Pratham Books. Prizes will be awarded to the best conservation tips and slogans on Forests & Wildlife Conservation.

December 10 is quite a red-letter day. There will be a conducted tour of Lalbagh to study trees and a book reading of ‘Walk Among the Trees’, written by Nimret Handa. The tour and reading will be done by children’s writer Roopa Pai. There will be 25 kids on this tour, so do call 25420925 and reserve your place. 

The concluding event of the campaign will be an interactive session with herpetologist Gerry Martin, along with the launch of the book, ‘A King Cobra’s Summer’.
