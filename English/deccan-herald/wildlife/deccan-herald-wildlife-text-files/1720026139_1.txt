Two elephants were killed after being hit by a speeding goods train in Odisha's Keonjhar district, officials said Thursday. The driver of the train has been arrested for running the train beyond the permissible limit of 20 km per hour in the wildlife zone. ADVERTISEMENTThe accident occurred when a herd of elephants was crossing the railway track Wednesday night through a forested area near Champua, about 300 km from state capital Bhubaneswar.

"A male and a female elephant were killed on the spot, while a calf managed to escape" the speeding train, wild life officer S.A. Mishra said. Forest officials have been deployed at the site to take care of the calf, he added.

He said the train was later halted by officials at a nearby railway station. "We have seized the train and arrested its driver for violation of Wild Life Protection Act," Mishra said.
The train was running at high speed, although the permissible limit was only 20 km per hour in the region, he added.
