He had kidnapped two-and-a-half-year-old Chiranjivi, son of Raghu and Suma, on Wednesday night. Gundappa’s second wife Manjamma is Suma’s aunt.
Manjamma had left home due to some problem with Gundappa and was staying with Suma. 
She did not heed repeated requests by Gundappa to return home.

According to the Amruthahalli police, Gundappa felt, she would return home if she had no shelter. 

He even asked Suma to keep her out of her house, to which Suma refused. On Wednesday, Gundappa kidnapped the child to force Suma to throw Manjamma out of her house. 
He called Suma and told her that he would return the child only if Manjamma was thrown out.
Following a complaint by Raghu and Suma, police laid a trap for Gundappa. When the accused called again on Thursday morning, Suma promised to bring his wife to the place where he was hiding. 
After Gundappa revealed his hiding spot, Suma and Manjamma went there and got the child’s possession. 
Immediately, the waiting police moved in and arrested Gundappa. 
A case of kidnap has been booked against him.
