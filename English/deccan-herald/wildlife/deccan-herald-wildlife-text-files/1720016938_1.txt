On the first day, the Department of Hotel Management conducted events like ‘Executive Chef’, ‘Executive Housekeeper’ and ‘F&B  Manager’.

 These events were aimed to test the culinary skills of the participants and delved into the intricacies of managing relationships in the three broad dimensions of customers, suppliers and employers. 

The departments of English, Hindi and Kannada had events related to their stream which included extempore speech-making, debate competitions, poem recitation, painting and singing competitions. 

There were other competitions conducted simultaneously by the Media Studies and Journalism students like mock press conference, jockeying and animation 
competitions. 

Concepts like wildlife, environment and civic issues plaguing the society were included in most of the events.

Day two had competitions organised by departments of Biotechnology, Electronic Science, Mathematics and Computer science. 

The technology braniacs had to battle with each other in the different science-related events based on the principles of genetic studies, scientific puzzles, java encoding and others.

Commerce and Management students were part of the management fest called ‘Elixir’ and with events like the ‘Best Manager’, ‘Marketing’, ‘Finance’, they had to prove their managerial and analytical skills with the various rounds of case analysis, presentations and stress interviews. 

The ‘Best Manager’ was the most competitive among all the categories. 
The Department of Physiotherapy and Nursing organised events for the students of this faculty. 

Quiz, paper presentation, seminars all centered around the subjects they specialised in. 
On the same day, a sports meet called ‘Agon’ was also held which had football and basketball matches.

Apart from all this, an intra-collegiate fest called Prathibimb was also conducted. 

The students of the college took part in various competitions like solo dance, rangoli, fashion show, clay modelling and painting. These array of competitions, which took place throughout the week, culminated with a cultural programme on the fifth day. The highlight of this programme was the presence of Bollywood actor Tusshar Kapoor who awarded the winners of these events. And although it rained that day, it didn’t dampen the spirits of these college students who were energetic as always. Agreeing to this, Pranita, a student of final year BBM says, “It gave us all the more reason to enjoy ourselves as we danced in the rain.”

The students, who had come from countries outside India, had a day all to themselves with ‘Gardenia Internationale,’ which was held on the sixth day.

 One could notice that this college is truly a melting pot of various cultures as students from Maldives, Nepal, Middle-East and the African nations mingled with each other dressed in their traditional attire. 

They were also given a chance to showcase the cultural heritage of their respective countries as they put up stalls. Apart from this, there were special performances on all the days by MJs Rakesh and Prithvi, Rock Band ‘Camoufragile’ etc.ADVERTISEMENT
