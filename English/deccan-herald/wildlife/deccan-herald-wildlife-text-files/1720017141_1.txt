NGO Uday has complained to National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the central environment and forest ministry and the state's chief wildlife warden that the 12-hour telethon Dec 12 committed gross violations of various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for violating sound limits in the tiger reserve. 

"The campaign targeted profits and more TRPs regardless of the ill effect on wildlife... although it's a good move to start awareness among people and unite them for a global cause... but pros and cons should be kept in mind before organising such an event," Shehla Masood of Uday told IANS.

The programme had generated about Rs.5 crore for tiger projects in India. Masood also said that the NTCA has informed her that they have forwarded the complaints to authorities concerned for further action.

State Chief Wildlife Warden H.S. Pabla told IANS that the complaint was "not much of a serious issue". "The programme had been organised outside the park, so we have to see the legalities of the jurisdiction," he said.ADVERTISEMENT
