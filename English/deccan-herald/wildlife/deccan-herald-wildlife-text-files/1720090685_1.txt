The bilateral talks between Basavaraj Bommai and Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Ministers of Karnataka and Kerala, respectively, in Bengaluru, ended in a deadlock after the former refused to grant permission for any projects in eco-sensitive places.ADVERTISEMENTBommai told reporters that his Kerala counterpart during the talks had sought permission for various railway and road projects connecting the two states.But the CM said these projects fall in ecologically sensitive areas and wildlife sanctuaries, and hence can't be taken up.Strangely, a statement from Vijayan's office said that Karnataka will consider the proposal for the new rail line between Kaniyur in Dakshina Kannada and Kanhangad in the Kasargod district of Kerala.Bommai said that Kerala has sought cooperation for various railway projects including the Kanhangad-Kaniyur rail line and other highway projects.The proposed Kanhangad-Kaniyur rail line spans a length of 40 km in Kerala and 31 km in Karnataka."However, this project is not very beneficial for Karnataka. Besides, it will pass through the rich bio-diversity and ecologically sensitive areas of the Western Ghats," he said, adding that Kerala CM has been informed that it is not possible for Karnataka to co-operate on this project.Vijayan also discussed the old project of the Thalassery-Mysuru rail line but was told that it is not possible to give permission as the proposed rail route will traverse through Bandipur and Nagarhole National Parks, the CM said.Vijayan's proposal for an underground rail route was also rejected on environmental grounds, according to Bommai.Apart from this, increasing the frequency of buses at night via Bandipur National Highway from two to four was also rejected, Bommai added.In a statement issued by the Kerala CM, he said that both states will jointly urge the National Highway Authority of India to implement an alternative alignment of the Mysuru-Malappuram economic corridor project by overcoming the difficulties caused by night traffic restrictions on NH-766, which passes through the Bandipur National Park.As an alternative, Karnataka and Kerala will jointly urge the NHAI to implement the Tholpetty (Wayanad)-Purakkattiri (Kozhikode) and Sultan Bathery-Malappuram stretch of the Mysuru-Malappuram economic corridor project.The Karnataka government even said it will consider extending financial support to the Kaniyooru-Kanhangad line, the statement by Kerala CMO said.
