Wildlife photographer Krupakar said students can gain experience only by exploring in their field of interest. If students explore their ideas and involve whole heartedly in them, the experience they gain will be of higher level, which in turn would guide them in their future.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking after the re-release of photography book ‘Belaku-Neralu’ written by M Y Ghorpade in the city on Thursday, Krupakar explained that his stint as wildlife photographer with Senani spending years in forest for filming documentaries was a great experience. New scientific inventions have made documentation of animals or other species a wonderful experience and a lot more easier, he said.

Recalling the days spent with Ghorpade, Krupakar said he was a reserved person and used to concentrate more on his work. Describing ‘black and white’ as a fantasy medium, the prints of which have a classic touch, he said Ghorpade’s way of photography was different. He used to capture images of animals and birds in the forest with the help of two assistants on an open van. 

Krupakar said there is no particular formula for writing or photography so his and Senani’s style of photography was completely different compared with that of Ghorpade.

The event was organised by Abhinava and Chamarajendra Academy of Visual Arts (CAVA) in memory of M Y Ghorpade.

Social worker G P Basavaraju, Abhinav Shantha Nagaraj, P S Geetha and CAVA dean Deshpande and students were present.
