A five-foot-long cobra was rescued from the JNU campus after it was found entangled in a net. The cobra was found entangled in a synthetic net outside the nursery at the National Institute of Plant Genome Research. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe staff found that the cobra was trying to free itself from the mesh for long but could not successfully do so. 

The nursery workers immediately contacted Wildlife SOS, an NGO on their 24-hour rescue helpline.

A two-member team was sent to the location. On arrival, the rescue team asked the staff to main a safe distance from the cobra which was in an agitated state to avoid any accident.

“The workers were on their way to the nursery when they discovered the cobra entwined in the net that is used as part of the fencing around the enclosure. On hearing about this unfortunate incident, we immediately contacted WildlifeSOS for their assistance, ” said Praveen Verma, who placed the call.

The staff then rescued the snake and transferred it into a safety container. 

“Synthetic netting in gardens, swimming pools and football fields cause thousands of fatalities to wildlife. Unsuspecting reptiles, birds and small mammals often get entangled and trapped and choke to death.

 “In this case, the situation was extremely delicate as we were dealing with a venomous snake and had to be extremely careful while untangling it from the net,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS.

The cobra was found to be unhurt and will soon be released back into its natural habitat.
