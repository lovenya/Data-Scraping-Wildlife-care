Wildlife officials are excited over the sighting. It was believed that around a dozen tigers were in the reserve, but though forest officials had heard their roar, none had been sighted earlier.

"This is the first time that a tiger has been photographed in Buxa. It proves that tigers do exist in the sanctuary," state Chief Wildlife Warden S B Mondol told reporters. "Sarkar was looking for scats for DNA profiling as part of the ongoing tiger census in the Hatipota range of the reserve when he sighted the tiger dragging a deer away.    The beat officer managed to take a few snaps of the tiger from behind a bush," he said.

"This is extremely encouraging and it proves that tigers do exist in the Buxa reserve even though it was said that no big cats existed there," Mondol said. The 761-sq-km reserve in Jalpaiguri district bordering Bhutan has a variety of wildlife including leopard, deer, sambar, Indian bison, sloth bear and wild dog. Field Director of the reserve R P Saini said the tiger which was sighted was a sub-adult.

He said the state government had submitted a proposal for captive breeding of tigers in Buxa and is awaiting clearance from the Union Environment and Forest ministry. Tigers had to be brought for this from sanctuaries like Manas in Assam or Dudhwa in UP which are similar to Buxa, he said. There are also plans for camera trapping to count the tigers in the reserve after scat and pug mark analysis, Mondol said.ADVERTISEMENT
