Besides putting in place stringent security measures ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Federal Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel’s visit to the Bosch factory at Adugodi in the City on Tuesday, security agencies carried out a unique combing operation for reptiles in the factory’s vicinity.

ADVERTISEMENTSecurity agencies roped in volunteers from People for Animals (PfA), a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation organisation, for the purpose. The volunteers from PfA, who scanned the vast premises and adjoining areas, found a rat snake.

This unique security protocol was taken up by the authorities to search for reptiles such as snakes to ensure the safety of not only the dignitaries but also the large turnout expected for the event. 

The rescue team conducted thorough search operations in and around the vicinity of the Bosch factory between October 3 and 5.

“The factory campus is surrounded by lush greenery and hence the authorities have taken extra measures to ensure the safety of the prime minister and the German chancellor. As snakes prefer seclusion, the search operation was done in the best interest of the creatures as well,” a release from PfA said.
