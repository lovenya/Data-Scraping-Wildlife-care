The Revenue and Forest departments have launched a special drive to check illegal resorts and homestays in the reserve forest areas of the district. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe officials have identified eight resorts for eviction. But, there are more than 25 resorts and homestays operating in the Bandipur tiger reserve zone. 

The resorts, run by influential persons in industry and politics, have been allowed to operate on the pretext of popularising eco-tourism. 

Besides, the mushrooming of resorts on the Kaniyanapura-Madumalai elephant corridor has obstructed free movement of elephants, contributing to human-elephant conflict. 

The Tourism department has approved six resorts in Gundlupet taluk. However, many influential persons – who have managed to secure no objection certificates from the Gram Panchayat – have constructed more resorts and homestays, in violation of the guidelines laid down by the departments of Revenue, Tourism and Forest.

These influential people pay the land conversion fee to the Revenue department and get the land converted, on the pretext of constructing guest houses and hotels. There are eight resorts constructed flouting the rules in the limits of the Bandipur forest, in the vicinity of the elephant corridor. Officials do not want to make the names of the owners public, lest the eviction drive is hampered.

A B Basavaraju, the assistant commissioner, told Deccan Herald that the Bandipur National Park was on the verge of being included in the list of eco-sensitive zones. Hence, resorts and other commercial establishments would not be allowed to come up on land belonging to the Revenue department within Bandipur. 

A list of those resorts that have been set up in violation of the Karnataka Revenue Act has been prepared. Such resorts will be cleared in association with the Forest department, so as to prevent the harm caused to wildlife, he said. A resort that had come up near Melukamanahalli has already been demolished.
