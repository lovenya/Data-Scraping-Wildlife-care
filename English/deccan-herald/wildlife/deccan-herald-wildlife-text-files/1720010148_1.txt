In spite of making her mark nationally and internationally by collaborating with the likes of Brett Lee and Code Red, the singer still bears one regret. 

On the occasion of the first death anniversary of king of pop, Michael Jackson, last month on June 23, Asha recalled the time when she had got an opportunity to record a song with MJ. But looks like destiny had other plans.  

It was in the year 1983, when MJ was yet to become a sensation and that is when he and Asha were supposed to do a song together. Reminiscing about the incident, Asha says, “I was supposed to record with Michael Jackson but then, it had to be cancelled for some reason. Later, it was a different ballgame altogether to work with him.”  Well, all we can say is the fans of both the legends missed the chanced of seeing the two together.  Reflecting reality  Director and editor Sanjay Sharma and writer and actor Kapil Sharma’s bold and sensitive film Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon, which depicts the life of gays has bagged the first prize among 110 films at the Kashish Mumbai Queer International Film Festival, held recently in Mumbai. 

The films from Europe, USA and South Asia were also screened at the festival. The award for the first mainstream Indian film, which sensitively and boldly deals with the stigma of being gay, went to Dunno Y... It also got a standing ovation. 

Ashok Row Kavi, editor of a popular newspaper said after watching the film, “I cried a lot because the film depicts the present situation of gays in India. I hope this may change things.”

The film stars Zeenat Aman and Helen along with Kabir Bedi, Parikshat Sahni, Asha Sachdev, Aryan Vaid, Rituparna Sen Gupta, Hazel, Maradonna Rebello (who 
appeared in the recently released Pankh), Yuvraaj Parashar, Kapil Sharma, Vinay Apte and Vivek Vaswani to name a few. ‘Kajraare is ours’Music composers obviously aren’t too amused about the fact that they work behind the scenes without getting as much credit as they deserve. 

They are, in fact, condemning the tendency of people to totally ignore those, who have created the music in the first place. At a recent event, composer trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy vented their disappointment on this topic.  

They said, “We composers create the song but someone else takes the credit and we remain unnoticed. For example, Kajraare is a very famous song composed by us.” 

“But people call it as Aishwarya Rai’s song. It is not composed by Aishwarya, it is composed by us. We compose the track with so much toil but when someone else takes the credit, it really hurts,” say the three musicians.
