Environmentalists have urged the authorities to stop the work on a watchtower at Mullayanagiri. The natural site at Mullayanagiri is being levelled to construct watchtower. ADVERTISEMENTIn a bid to promote tourism, nature is being spoiled by the authorities. The work on laying pillars for the watchtower has commenced. What was the need for constructing a watch tower, asked Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust trustee D V Girish and State Wildlife Board former member Girijashankar. They urged the deputy commissioner to intervene and visit the spot to stall the watch tower work. There is natural place in the vicinity to view the beauty of nature at the spot, they said.
