However, of late, the sanctuary only gets a trickle of visitors. Visitors who come till the entrance of the sanctuary, return without paying a visit. Reason: The sudden and illogical hike in entry fee. The fee has been hiked to Rs 50 for adults and Rs 25 for children from Rs 15.

The entry fee for vehicles (car, tempo, jeep, SUVs and MUVs) has been raised to Rs 500 from Rs 100 and to Rs 1,500 from Rs 500 for buses. College and school students who come on study tour to Hampi make it a point to visit the sanctuary. 

Apart from this, visitors to the annual three-day Hampi Utsav - who come from all over the world - also like to visit the sanctuary. However, the steep hike in fees forces the visitors to back off from their plan even after reaching the entrance.

The forest department staff feed a mixture of jaggery and corn to the bears at a designated place of the sanctuary, between 3 pm and 6 pm.  The bears arrive in large numbers at the said spot during these hours to feed on what is offered by the staff. They can be seen relishing the meal from a watch tower.

However, the tower is five km inside the sanctuary and can only be reached through vehicles. But high fees are stopping the people from taking their vehicles inside. The fee is proving to be a burden for school and college students. Many people have urged the government to rollback the fee hike. 

Variety of species
As many as 100 species of birds, butterflies, wild boars, peacocks and other animals are found in the sanctuary. “The visitors may miss them due to the steep hike in entrance fees,” said Kamalamma, a teacher in a school in Bellary.

“Even after paying the entrance fees, visitors don’t spot bears or any other animals many a time as the sanctuary is vast,” said Veeranjaneya, a staffer. The government should also provide bus facilities to the place, he added.

A memorandum has been submitted to the Forest Minister to reduce the fees as the number of visitors is dwindling, said Kiran, Assistant Conservator of Forests and incharge of the sanctuary.ADVERTISEMENT
