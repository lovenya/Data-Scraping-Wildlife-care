The areas surrounding Gaganachukki and Bharachukki waterfalls received a fresh lease of life as volunteers of Into The Wild (ITW) joined hands with Karnataka State Pollution Control Board organised a campaign to clear plastic and garbage near the waterfalls recently.

ADVERTISEMENTThe activity was taken up to coincide with World Earth Day in order to improve awareness among people about natural resources. Prior to the activity, ITW carried out a survey of these locations and found that a large amount of garbage was littered around these spots.

Despite being considered    to be of historical and cultural importance, the areas near the waterfalls were unhygienic. 

More than 25 volunteers aged between 16 and 77 years gathered at the waterfalls to participate in the activity.

Almost 90 -95 per cent of plastic discards such as large water bottles, plastic cups, covers, plates, fastfood covers and other items were removed from the surroundings after nine hours of work by the ITW volunteers. 

Care was taken to pack all the collected plastic garbage in jute and gunny bags.  Over 50 large- sized gunny bags were collected by the end of the day. The garbage collection was later disposed by KSPCB.

Prior to start of the activity all volunteers were given a briefing on health, safety and environment.

Boat ride organisers at Bharachukki offered ITW volunteers a free trip upon learning of their involvement in the cleaning activity. 

Volunteers took the opportunity to educate the local shopkeepers, hawkers and the general public on waste disposal and refrain from littering garbage and plastic. 
With the success of this activity, ITW members opined that they intend to take up more such projects in the future.

ITW is involved on a regular basis with the forest department in the protection and conservation of wildlife at the Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta and other hills in the Bandipur range.
