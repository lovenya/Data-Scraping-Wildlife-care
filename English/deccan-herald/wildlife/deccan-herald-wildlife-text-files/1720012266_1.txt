Noticing this and the impact of such activities on flora and fauna, the residents around the reserve forest area have demanded action from the government to stop such activities.

The forest officials have restricted entry of locals into the forest areas in Lakkavalli, Hebbe, Thanigebail, Muthodi areas in the Reserve forest limits on the grounds of threat due to forest fire but on the other hand, the officials are carrying on various construction works in the Core Zone using advance machineries and heavy vehicles. Residents of Lakkavalli have alleged that these constructions have been disturbing the wildlife.

PCCF Guideline states that construction works cannot be undertaken in reserve forest area using heavy vehicles and machineries etc but much against this guideline, there are over 10 tractors, 5 JCBs deployed in Lakkavalli area. In Thanigebail, there are 2 JCBs along with 5 tractors carrying on afforestation works. In Muthodi 1 JCB and two tractors are filling a lake. 

Drainage, culvert and one kilometre long road is being laid at Muthodi, Kodi and Thanigebail area. The residents say that though summer season has started, the officials have not spared a thought to appoint firemen, lay fire line or to form fire control squad.

There are no traces of patrol vehicles. The Poaching Control Camp which should have 8 watchers is presently functioning with only two watchers. Since these camps are not working efficiently, the cases of poaching in the reserve forest limits have increased.  The residents have demanded the Government to have CoD Inquiry into the issue and punish all those officials who are at fault.

The residents say that looking at the way the rules are being violated by the officials, they are forced to question the authorities concerned whether they know the meaning of the word ‘Reserve Forest’. The local residents have also raised question over the silence of environmentalists in all of these issues.ADVERTISEMENT
