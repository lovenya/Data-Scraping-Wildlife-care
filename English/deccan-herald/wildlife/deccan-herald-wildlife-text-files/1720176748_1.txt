According to the Act, no one is allowed to possess any wild or exotic animal (dead or alive) without a valid certificate or licence.In 2015, the traditional Peshawari chappal or sandal was launched by Shinwari as Kaptaan Chappal."No matter who the sandals were being made for, an illegal act would never be tolerated," Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Environment Ishtiaq Urmur had said."If it is proven that the chappals were indeed made of snakeskin then the cobbler will have to face legal consequences as well as a fine provided he shows necessary documentation that it was (legally) imported," he said after the report emerged.
