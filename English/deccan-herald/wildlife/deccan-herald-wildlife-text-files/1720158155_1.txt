State's Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest Shashi Kumar said "indirect evidence" of tiger's presence found during the wildlife census. However, the same would be confirmed only in the second phase.

"There is a possibility of tiger presence in state's forests. There is evidence of its presence which will be confirmed through camera trapping method," he said. Kumar's statement assumes significance amid persistent denials by the department to move ahead with a proposal to declare Goa's wildlife sanctuaries as tiger habitat.

At a recent meeting with the members of Western Ghat Conservation Panel, environmentalists had put up a proposal to declare Goa as a tiger reserve. The forest department here conducted wildlife census with the help of Dehuradun based Wildlife Institute of India (WII), this year.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of Wildlife Week celebrations which began today, Kumar said the camera-trapping method will take the visuals and indicate the number of tigers in the forests.

Kumar said WII is yet to analyse the data collected from Goa since it is busy with the tiger census conducted at various wildlife sanctuaries in the country. Meanwhile, Kumar allayed fears that Goa's forest cover is dwindling. "The forest cover is increasing in Goa and that is primarily because the state has a culture to preserve, protect and love trees," he said.ADVERTISEMENT
