A nine-year-old girl was killed after she was attacked and bitten by a wild monkey in Sangam Vihar area in south-east Delhi, police said on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENTDeepanshi was among half a dozen people who were attacked by the macaque monkey and brought to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Thursday. “Deepanshi succumbed to her injuries on Sunday morning. Her body has been preserved for post-mortem,” a senior police official said.

Another girl bitten by the monkey has been referred to Safdarjung Hospital. The residents of Sangam Vihar now claim that they are forced to stay indoors because of the monkey brigade that comes calling as soon as they attempt to step out.

“The monkeys chase people on rooftops and storm through the kitchen windows to feast on whatever is available,” a resident said. On the other hand, the government authorities have battled a booming macaque population in the national capital for a long time.

They have also employed professional monkey catchers to control the menace. 

The trapped monkeys are sent to Asola Bhatti Mines forests owned by the Wildlife department of Delhi government.
