Or “Mobile phones are the curse of today’s youngsters!” That would be from a grumpy grandma who’s been trying in vain to get you to help her clean the old cupboard upstairs, while you’re lost in SMS heaven.

Well, NOW’s the time for you to prove that your mobile phone (or the slightly higher end model that one of your parents has!) can be put to good use. It’s important that you wake up a little earlier that most families do during the summer break for two reasons.
One, your father himself will not be glued to his fancy phone (which you might plan to use since its camera is much better than yours!) and second, what you’re going to do with it, is photograph birds, which are early risers (remember, the early bird catches the worm?).
The idea is not to win the National Geographic photo contest of the year. Instead, it’s to get to know our feathered neighbours by name. And summer mornings are a great time to start. 

The koels are out by 5:30 a.m. The one outside my window starts off a long conversation every morning with another koel two streets away. There’s a lot of back and forth between them, which goes on for about half an hour. Last week, somebody’s car horn went off at 4 o’clock in the morning, and could not be switched off for a good 5 minutes. ADVERTISEMENTThat must have confused my window-side koel, because he began his loud morning yaki-ti-yak at 4:25 a.m! I listened for the normal reply from the bird two lanes away. It didn’t come. My bird tried again — a very long sentence, I remember. And then I heard the response – a short, low, grumpy two-syllable snort – probably, “Shut up!” in bird talk! And the bird by my window, thankfully, took that birdy advice and went back to sleep!

Our garden has a crow pheasant in residence for long stretches of the year. This is a beautiful bird, jet black on the underside, with stunning rust brown wings. It waddles around rather clumsily on the ground, giving you, a first-time mobile camera photographer, a chance to get a decent picture. So every time you get a picture of some bird you want the name of, download the picture onto your desktop (or directly send it, if your phone has Internet access). Get online and check out the following online group…bngbirds@yahoogroups.com. Click to become a member, and e-mail the group your picture, along with a polite request for someone to identify the bird for you. This group of avid amateur bird watchers meet every alternate Sunday, at either Lal Bagh or Hebbal Lake, early mornings. If you’ve been lucky enough to get a few of your pictures identified, and you find that you rather like the idea of getting to know birds better, it’s time to take your new interest to the next stage. Who knows, you might grow up to follow in the footsteps of India’s most famous ornithologist, Salim Ali. You may get your family even angrier with you by insisting some adult wakes up early on Sunday morning to take you for a bird walk with the group.One Sunday walk with the Bangalore bird enthusiasts (timings and meeting points are usually announced online, so stay tuned) will teach you a lot. Where the owlets hang out, half-asleep, and hence easy to photograph. The Hebbal Lake walk will introduce you to a lot of water birds – kingfishers, egrets, darters and cranes. And the very best part of it all is that everything is free! The birds, being a member of the group and the camera (which came with the mobile phone, remember!)
Carry a little note book with you on the walks, so you can write down the names of birds you spotted. If you’re not happy with the hazy photograph you snapped, but remember the bird vividly, the moment you’re home, try to draw it. Use your  photo as a broad reference, but heighten the colours to what you feel is right. You will find that those interested in birds, invariably also know the names of trees and plants, so those are interesting tidbits you can write down. Tree names, flowering shrubs, and you might even find that the kindest, most patient grown-up explaining things to you, is some very famous photographer or wildlife expert! Have fun. A bird album would be a lovely souvenir to make for yourself this summer.
