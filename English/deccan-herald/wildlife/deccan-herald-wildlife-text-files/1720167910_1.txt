The Women and Child Development department has decided to convert 1,000 anganwadi centres into children-friendly ‘Bala Snehi Kendras’. As many as 171 of 871 anganwadi centres in Kodagu district will soon get a new look. Already 44 anganwadi centres have received a facelift and the works are on to make the remaining 127 centres into Bala Snehi Kendras. 

The select anganwadi centres are given a facelift at a cost of Rs 10,000 each. At Ponnampet, 40 centres have been already made children-friendly. Two anganwadi centres each in Madikeri taluk and Somwarpet have been given a new-look. According to the concept, the walls of the centres will be adorned with paintings of birds, animals, flowers, fruits and vegetables. A painting of wildlife with a mix of herbivores and cornivores like elephants, deers, tigers and lions, all in one painting is the main attraction.

Not to miss the curriculum, Kannada and English alphabets have also found place with numericals. This apart, the information on services provided, pre-schooling education, nutritious food, health tips and timely health check up among others will be posted on the walls. The new-look will surely remind one of the environ of private convents.

Apart from trying to rekindle the children’s interest in anganwadis, the new concpet also provides a perfect platform for local artists to showcase their talent. The artists have been advised against using harmful paints. In the first phase, the anganwadi centres which are in fine condition have been selected under the project, an official preferring anonymity told DH.

At a time when the enrollment at anganwadi centres is dwindling, the department has taken a key step towards making anganwadi centres a better place of learning, the official added.
