Eight teams under the panel inspected 90 operating mines and 32 non-operating mines in the coastal state in the wake of prevalent illegalities at various levels in iron ore mining, the official said, adding that the commission will now be analysing the collected data.

"The inquiry is just at a preliminary state. We need to analyse it (data) and seek more clarifications, if required," he said.

The commission, which began its probe in mid-September, scrutinised documents from the state Mines and Geology department, Forest Department, Revenue Department and Goa State Pollution Control Board. It is also probing whether the mining leases have encroached upon the nearby lands.

The Commission is expected to submit its report in next 15 days to the Central government.
Amid the probe, forest department has already issued notices to 19 mines working close to the wildlife sanctuaries and national park to suspend operations. Similarly, Goa State Pollution Control Board has issued notices to 40 mines for not having consent under Water and Air Pollution Control Board Act.

Goa Legislative Assembly's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has also issued notices to 48 mining leases in the state.

The inquiry has rattled the Digambar Kamat-led Congress government, mired into allegations of illegal mining, to sit up and take note of the illegalities.

Goa is the largest exporter of iron ore in the country with around 54 million metric ton of ore being exported from both the ports in the state.ADVERTISEMENT
