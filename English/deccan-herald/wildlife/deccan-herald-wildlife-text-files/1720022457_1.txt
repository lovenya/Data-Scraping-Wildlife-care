Reckless stone quarrying in eight sites within the limits of Malemahadeshwara and Edeyarahalli reserve forests in Kollegal taluk in the district, is posing a threat to the elephant corridor that falls within its boundaries.

In flagrant violation of the rule, permits have been granted to as many as eight sites near the two reserve forest areas in the taluk, thereby affecting the movement of elephants.

On a State government directive, a special team was constituted to probe into illegal stone quarrying on the periphery of reserve forests in the district. The team comprising officers of the Departments of Mines and Geology, Revenue and Forest, conducted a joint survey and noted that illegal quarrying was rampant in areas surrounding the elephant corridor.

The team submitted a report to the district administration, a copy of which is withÂ  Deccan Herald, recommending that illegal quarrying be banned in the reserve forest area. The Edeyarahalli-Doddasampige Elephant Corridor connects the Kollegal forest area and Biligiriranganathaswamy Tiger Reserve Forest. 

Land encroached

In 2007, the Wildlife Trust of India, an NGO, purchased 23 acres of land encroached upon near the elephant corridor and transferred it to the Forest department. 

But now, illegal stone quarrying is rampant on three acres of patta land (survey number 64/3) and four-and-a-half acres (survey number 64/5) at Minya village in Edeyarahalli reserve forest limits. 

Similarly, illegal stone quarrying is taking place on two acres of government land (survey number 377/2) in Huttur village.

Permits have been granted for stone quarrying at five sites in Malemahadeshwara reserve forest area that is adjacent to Edeyarahalli forest. 

Quarrying has had a debilitating effect on the forest area, which houses a large elephant population. 

Quarrying is being allowed in five sites bearing survey nos 24, 1,96, 96 B and 86 at Ponnachi village. 
It is important to note that all the five sites belong to the government.
