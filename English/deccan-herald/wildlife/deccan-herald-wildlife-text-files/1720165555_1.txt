An accidental fire destroyed more than 10 acres of vegetation atop the Chamundi Hills here on Wednesday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe fire was spotted around 1.30 pm near the Tavarakatte village side. The villagers immediately informed the Forest department, which in turn alerted the Fire and Emergency Services.

About 40 forest and 20 fire department personnel managed to douse the flames after a two-hour-long struggle, spraying water from atop the hill. Heavy winds caused the fire to spread over dried bushes up to the watch tower near the Nandi statue. Eucalyptus trees, champa and bushes were destroyed, sources said.

Deputy Conservator of Forests V Karikalan told Deccan Herald the fire must have spread from a beedi or cigarette butt or could be the handiwork of miscreants.

More destruction

Just two days ago, a wildfire had erupted destroying more than 500 acres of forest under Hediyala range. Miscreants reportedly set fire in the forest at Yettinagudda area, destroying more than 150 acres of forest under Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Division, in Chamarajanagar district, on Monday.
