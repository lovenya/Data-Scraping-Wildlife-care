Call of the wild

ADVERTISEMENTPerhaps no tourist will miss an opportunity to visit the scenic locales of Mysore and the Kabini Jungle Lodge at Karapur. In order to make this place an eco tourist location the efforts of one tireless personality who died a few years ago cannot be ignored. He is Colonel John Wakefield, who can also be called the torch bearer of Karnatakaâ€™s first eco-tourism project at the Kabini River Lodge on the banks of River Kabini at Karapur in Mysore district.

John Wakefield an Indian born Englishman had a long kinship with the jungle and the wildlife of India. This began at an early age itself as his father was working with Maharaja of Tikara. He also learnt the intricacies of hunting under the guidance of his father. Though he was sent to England for studies, he returned early as his heart was in India. 
The call of the jungle was irresistible to Wakefield. He worked in many organisations in different capacities. 

His long and significant relationship with a resort in India and Nepal began in the year 1978 and his expertise in the field brought him to Karnataka to develop resorts in Kabini.
