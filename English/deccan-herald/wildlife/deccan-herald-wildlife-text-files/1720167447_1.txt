The arrival of Rama, a five-year-old white tiger, at the Sajjangarh Biological Park from a Chennai zoo, has left the zookeepers in Udaipur in a real tizzy. As Rama was raised in Chennai, he apparently understands instructions only in Tamil. 

His new keepers, primarily Marwari-speaking, are happy to have him under an animal exchange programme with Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai, but are also worried about making him behave.

Rama was shifted to the park in a government vehicle under the leadership of veterinarian Himanshu Vyas. His arrival has brought joy to many wildlife lovers because a white tiger is rarely seen in Rajasthan, except in the Jaipur zoo which has one white tiger. 

The newly constructed zoological park has space for four tigers. The park already has Damini, a nine-year-old tigress shifted from Pune, and T-24 shifted from Ranthambore. On Rama’s arrival, zookeepers at the park were seen exchanging notes with his caretakers, who came along with him. According to reports, the zoo is already planning to employ a Tamil-speaking trainer to work with Rama. 

However, Chief Conservator of Forest, Udaipur, Rahul Bhatnagar said, “Animals know one universal language. We are excited to have a new tiger in the park. It will help boost tourism, and wildlife lovers will get to see a variety of animals here in the park.”
