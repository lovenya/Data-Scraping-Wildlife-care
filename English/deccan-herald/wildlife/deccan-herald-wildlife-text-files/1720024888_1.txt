As the sun sets, herd of elephants come right in front of the houses. Though there is an electric pole, the houses are yet to get electricity connection. This is the tale of Majjigehalla Aanecamp tribal hamlet at Aanechowkoor near Thithimathi.  

ADVERTISEMENTThe hamlet has around 30 houses with a population of 200 and all the residents belong to Jenukuruba community. The hamlet comes under Nagarahole wildlife division. Though electric poles have been installed to provide electricity under Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme, the forest officials are reportedly coming in the way of providing electricity as the village comes under National Wildlife division. 

As a result, the electric poles are lying idle in the village for the last three years. The houses which were constructed 30 years ago are in deplorable condition. They might collapse at any time. A few houses have developed cracks. The house owners are yet to get title deeds. An attempt is being made to shift the residents of the region. 

The residents have to depend on single borewell for drinking water. Aanekere which is situated near the hamlet is used for washing clothes. There is an anganwadi in the hamlet. Not many youth from the village have entered the portals of the college. 

The forest department had given the residents solar lamps five years ago. However, all the switch boards have rusted. None of the lamps are burning. 

Villagers said that they are devoid of basic facilities. “We can not step out of house in the night fearing attack of wild elephants. Our houses are on the verge of collapse.”
