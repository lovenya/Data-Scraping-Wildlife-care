According to a zoo official, the theft of the non-poisonous, two-feet long snake was noticed on Saturday when its enclosure was opened to feed it.

“The lock of the cage was broken and the Red Sand Boa was missing. It clearly appears to be a case of theft,” zoo director Anil Anjankar said on Sunday. A complaint has been lodged with the police.

Anjankar said this was the first instance of theft in the zoo since it was founded 150 years ago. “We have 10 snakes among 600 other animals in the zoo. The snakes include five large pythons and two cobras but they were not disturbed,” he said.

Wildlife experts say the commonly found Red Sand Boa is coveted by many in the belief that it can lead to hidden treasures.
