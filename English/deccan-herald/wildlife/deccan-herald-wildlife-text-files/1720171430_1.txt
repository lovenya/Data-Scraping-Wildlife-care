They feel that test firing during the peak turtle season could have adverse effects on the famous annual mass nesting of the endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles in the Gahirmatha beach. 

Gahirmatha which houses the world's biggest rookery for Olive Ridley turtles is located not far away from Wheelers Island missile testing centre from where the DRDO has already successfully test fired the Agni III missile this season. Besides, the organisation had also recently test fired, though unsuccessfully, the much awaited interceptor missile. What has sent the alarm bell ringing among the wildlife activists is the news report that more missile tests would be conducted soon from the premier missile launch pad. 
"I want to make it clear that we are not against the repeated test firing of missiles from Wheelers Island. Like others we too want to see the strengthening of our missile capability. What we want is temporary halt on test firing of missiles during the turtle season that is from November to May. They can go for any number of missile tests during rest of the months. Unfortunately our repeated plea in this regard has never been accepted", said Biswajit Mohanty of the Wildlife Society of Orissa which had been working for the protection of Olive Ridley turtles since long. 

Explaining how the test firing of missiles may affect the turtle nesting, Mohanty said, when a missile takes off from the ground the blast creates a lot of ground vibration which is felt even inside the sea. "As Olive Ridley turtle is a highly sensitive sea animal, there is a distinct possibility of these vibrations scaring the turtles during the mating as well as while they swim ashore to lay eggs", he said adding that hectic activities in and around the missile testing centre before and after the missile tests also affect the movement of turtles. 

Experts also do not rule out the possibility of these ground vibrations affecting the turtle eggs buried in sand holes on the beach. After swimming ashore, the turtles dig holes on the beach and cover the holes with sand after dropping their eggs on them. The eggs remain inside the holes for about 45 days before the birth of the turtle babies.      
Significantly, if activists are to be believed, when the DRDO decided to set up the premier missile testing centre in the Wheelers Island, it (the island) was handed over with the condition that no missile testing will be conducted during the turtle season. "Unfortunately, the condition had never been implemented", Mohanty said. 

Govt supports activists
Interestingly, the Orissa government which often crosses swords with the activists on the turtle protection issue has sided with the latter on the subject. "We have been requesting the DRDO officials at the beginning of every turtle season to halt the missile testing temporarily but in vain", said an official in the state's chief wildlife warden's office.
In fact, the Chief Wildlife Warden P N Padhi has said that he would soon be moving the Centre against the careless attitude of the DRDO. "We will soon appeal to the Defence and Environment ministries drawing their attention to the careless attitude of the DRDO," Padhi added. 

However, the authorities at the DRDO's Interim Test Range(ITR) which runs the missile launching centres at the Wheelers Island as well as at nearby Chandipur dismissed the allegations leveled against them, saying that the claims made by activists and the Orissa government officials were untrue.
"It is incorrect to say that the test firing of the missiles would affect the mass nesting of the turtles. There is no truth in it. Turtles never get affected by missile tests", said the Director of the ITR, S.P.Das. 

In support of his claim, Das said, more than two lakh Olive Ridley turtles had already participated in mass nesting in Gahirmatha beach this season. The congregation took place despite the test firing of the Agni III missile. "There would not have been such a large gathering of turtles had the missile tests affected their movement", he said. 
He said, the DRDO initiates several turtle friendly measures during every turtle season. They include switching off the powerful lights of the missile testing centre during mass nesting of the turtles. "As the turtles get disturbed by the bright lights, we switch them off during the nights when they swim ashore to lay eggs on the beach", Das said.
