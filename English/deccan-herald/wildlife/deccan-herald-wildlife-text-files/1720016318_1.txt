During the interaction, villagers expressed their unhappiness over Central government’s proposal. Many villagers said that the people in Kudremukh are already deprived of many rights after the declaration of the area as  Kudremukh National Park. “If the world heritage tag is accorded we will be deprived of the little rights that we are left with,” the villagers said.

Dr Vindy told media persons that once the region was given the World Heritage tag, then it will be protected forever. More emphasis will be given to protect the region and the biodiversity, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
The UN will never interfere in the affairs of local governments after including the place in the World Heritage list. Moreover, the land will belong to respective local government even after inclusion in the list, he said.

Pointing out example of Uganda, he said that if the local government fails to protect the region, then the UNO will have to withdraw the world heritage tag. He said that a committee of Chief Wildlife Wardens of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamilnadu has already been formed for the protection of Western Ghats. The committee will submit a report in November.  A final decision with regard to awarding of world heritage tag to Western Ghats will be taken after the meet of experts committee, which will be held in July next year,” Dr Vindy said.
