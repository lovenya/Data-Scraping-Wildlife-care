With animals in the Bandipur National Park (BNP) facing hardship due to acute scarcity of water, triggered by a bad drought, the Forest department has started supplying water to the partially dried-up water bodies inside the BNP.

ADVERTISEMENTWild animals, particularly elephant, tiger, deer and bison, are struggling to slake their thirst as there is water only in 15 of the 282 tanks/lakes inside the Bandipur National Park. Acute water shortage has forced several animals to migrate to theÂ  backwaters. But, even that region is facing water crisis.

Refill tanks

To ease the situation in the park, the Forest department decided to replenish tanks/lakes. 

However, the plan to fill the water bodies artificially, came under attack from wildlife experts who felt that such a move would lead to ecological and biological imbalance in the park.

Subsequently, the department set up an expert committee on the issue. After the experts visited the park and came out with their suggestions, the Forest department has started supplying 52,000 litres of water to partially dried-up lakes and tanks every day as suggested by the expert committee.

Six tanks of 2,000-litre capacity each have been constructed in the park and water is supplied using four tankers and two lorries. However, the quantity of water supplied daily is said to be inadequate. The Forest department has also got another borewell sunk in the park which already has three tubewells.

Conservator of Forest (BNP) H C Kantharaju told Deccan Herald that animlas were also facing a severe shortage of fodder.
