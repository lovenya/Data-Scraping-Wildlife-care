In its letter, 'India Against Corruption' has asked the Prime Minister to "immediately accept" the recommendations of a two-member Central Government panel for a CBI probe into the harassment suffered by IFS officer, Sanjiv Chaturvedi.

The letter, dated March 11, was signed by Senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, former civil servant Kiran Bedi, social activists Swami Agnivesh, Arvind Kejriwal and Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh, all members of the organisation.

In January, a two-member panel of the Union Environment Ministry had brought out in vivid details the harassment suffered by Chaturvedi, including at the hands of Haryana Chief Minister's office.

Harassment of the 2002 batch IFS officer included frequent transfers, 12 in five years, suspension and fabricated chargesheet for exposing large-scale irregularities in various projects, development of herbal park on private land belonging to politically influential persons and preventing the destruction of Saraswati Wildlife Sanctuary from influential contractors.

"The investigation into this case should be immediately handed over to the CBI," the letter said.

The organisation has also sent a letter to Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda demanding CBI probe.

Chaturvedi's suspension was revoked by President Pratibha Patil in January following submission of the report by the Committee headed by Inspector General of Forests A K Shrivastava and AIG Shally Ranjan.

Union Cabinet Secretary formed the two-member panel after the President received a complaint from Chaturvedi alleging that he was being harassed by the state's Congress Government for taking action against violators of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

The panel also found that there is strong evidence regarding the personal involvement of the then Forest Minister Kiran Chaudhary and relatives of independent MLA, Prahlad Singh Gillakhera who is supporting the present government from outside in the matter.ADVERTISEMENT
