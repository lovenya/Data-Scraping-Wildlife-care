Google has submitted plans to the Mountain View City Council in California, USA, to rebuild part of its campus headquarters and develop a series of  buildingADVERTISEMENTs. 

The plan is to create new, lightweight, block-like structures that can be moved around easily, instead of constructing immovable concrete buildings. Large, translucent canopies will cover each site and control the climate inside, while letting in natural light and air. The new property will integrate wildlife and sweeping waterways, with trees, landscaping, cafes and bike paths weaving through the structure.

According to Google, the new plans for the project in Silicon Valley have been designed by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels at BIG and London-based Heatherwick Studio. Bjarke said: “Silicon Valley has been an engine of innovation driving technological evolution and global economy.  So far, the majority of these vast intellectual and economic resources have been confined to the digital realm. 

Google North Bayshore expands this innovative spirit into the physical realm. Together with Heatherwick Studio and Google, we have set out to imagine the work environments of future Googlers to be as adaptable, flexible and intelligent as the rest of Google’s wide-spanning portfolio, rather than an insular corporate headquarters.  Google North Bayshore will be a vibrant new neighbourhood of Mountain View.” 

Google has been based in Mountain View, just outside San Francisco, for the last 15 years, in an office complex known as the Googleplex. “Today, we want to create office spaces that don’t just provide a great home for Google, but which also work for the city that has given us so much,” said the company.
