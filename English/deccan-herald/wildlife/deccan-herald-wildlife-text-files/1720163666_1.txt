It was a trailer of sorts for the Jamboo Savari - still a fortnight away - that Mysureans made the most of on Thursday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe City’s residents literally followed the trail of the pachyderms. It wasn’t the usual dress rehearsal for Dasara. But a day dedicated to the jumbos, the first-ever Elephants Day. The march of the gentle giants began from the Palace premises and ended at the Bannimantap, the usual route of the Jamboo Savari. Topping it all was the banners draping them, with messages for protecting the elephants that are among the endangered species. The procession had been organised by the wildlife division of the Forest department. 

Arjuna - the howdah elephant - had a banner reading ‘Nanu Dasara habbada sanketa’ (I am the symbol of Dasara festival), Balarama’s banner read, ‘Nanu ee nadina hemme’ (I am the pride of the State), Kenchamba was draped in a banner that said, ‘Idu nanna mane, nanna nadu’ (this is my land, my house), Chaitra’s banner read, ‘Nanu nimma sampattu, nanu nimma hemme’ (I am your wealth, I am your pride), Cauvery’s banner had the number of elephant population in the State, saying, ‘Ee rajyadalli nanna santhati 6,000’ (My tribe in the State is 6,000). 

Durgaparameshwari displayed the message ‘Nannannu samrakshisi’ (protect my life), while Abhimanyu had a promise, ‘Naanu yarigu thondare kododilla’ (I will not trouble anyone). Vikrama claimed, ‘Nanu e nadina raja’ (I am the king of the State). The nameplates of each of the jumbos was fixed to their foreheads. 

Students of Cauvery School, Mahajana Public School and GSSS Institute of Engineering and Technology for Women marched with the jumbos, enjoying the excitement all around. Passersby stopped a while to catch a glimpse of the elephants during the procession lasting an hour and a half. Rewards for the elephants came in the form of the fruits that were fed to them en route.
