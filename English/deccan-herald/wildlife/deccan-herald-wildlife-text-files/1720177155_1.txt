The officials were explained about the modus operandi of traffickers and how the grave issue is an organized crime with the presence of multiple persons in the entire process. The officials were explained about the vulnerability of Manipur and the role Assam Rifles has to play in combating the third largest crime in the world. Identification of victims and the procedures for handling cases were taught to the participants," said a statement issued by Assam Rifles.“Victim centric approach is mandatory while handling cases of human trafficking.

They were supposed to be taken to Myanmar first and then to countries like Singapore and Malaysia.
