The dog in uniform is much in demand. UB City, Cisco, Honey Well and many other leading firms are well aware of the sniffer dogs’ worth. Multinational companies are approaching agents to deploy dogs on their campuses, but demand is outstripping supply.

A chief security officer told Deccan Herald: “It is rather wise to invest in dogs than on equipment. In the current scenario, where corruption has gone beyond human imagination, where anyone can be bought, a sensible way to sanitise the sensitive area is by using dogs.”

Shyam, a city-based retired Air Force officer who started Biotools (India), Canines for Detection and Protection, had this to say: "Almost everyday I am approached by major industry giants from Bangalore but I am unable to fullfil their requirements for dogs."

No awareness
Dogs have proved their calibre in detecting explosives, narcotics, human remains, fake currency, gas leaks, pirated DVDs, banned agriculture products and wildlife products, termites and so on. But the awareness about their prowess is low in the country. 
Dogs are used in almost all the European and African countries and in US airports, ports, commercial establishments, crime investigations etc., but in India, there is still a baffling dependence on metal detectors and scanners. “Many a time, we don't even know whether we are using it rightly, but still continue,” chuckles Shyam.

Though the much sought after breeds are beagle, labrador, german shepherd, labrador retriever, doberman, boxer, etc. the ‘breed’ actually doesn't matter because the dogs have much superior olfactory sense than any other animal. It all depends on the training procedures which are multi-dimensional, once scientific techniques are followed, such as neurological stimulation, animal psychology, canine anatomy, chemical make up of explosives, training and testing protocols and so on, just after birth and scent imprinting while still in the nest, that the trainers get the best out of the animal, explains Shyam. The armed forces have started training dogs to put them use in high altitude, especially to identify bodies buried in Avalanche. At times of disaster, a dog is animal to trust.
Requisitions are pouring in to train dogs to help deaf in their homes and the industry is looking up.
