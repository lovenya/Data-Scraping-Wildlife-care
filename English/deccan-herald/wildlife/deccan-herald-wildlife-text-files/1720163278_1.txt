The 20-minute documentary on River Kali, which runs through the Anshi-Dandeli tiger reserve, has inspired the forest department and the forest minister so much that they are contemplating renaming the tiger reserve as Kali tiger reserve.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking on the sidelines of the first-ever screening of the documentary in the City on Sunday, Vinay Luthra, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, said that a proposal was being prepared and talks were on with the government in this regard.

The tale of the river 

The documentary tells the tale of Kali river - the shortest in India (184 km). It has seven dams and eight km of uninterrupted natural flow. The film explains the importance of the water body to wildlife, the tiger reserve and people residing around the reserve. Janaki Ajji, aged 101, and her grandson have narrated the story of the river in the film. 

The documentary is directed by filmmaker and wildlife 
photographer Amoghavarsha. 
The Kannada version of this documentary is also being made. The background voice for the Kannada version will be by noted actor Prakash Rai.

“Taking a cue from this, we are making a film on the entire Western Ghats called Wild Karnataka. Work on this project started around five months ago. The aim is to explain to people the importance of the pristine forest.”

“This film is being made by three professional filmmakers, using state-of-the-art technology and will be screened on BBC and National Geographic Channel. This project will cost around Rs two crore and will be funded under corporate social responsibility initiatives,” Luthra said.

Ricky Kej’s forest anthem

Amoghavarsha said that the department, Grammy award-winning singer Ricky Kej and his team have created a three-and-half-minute Karnataka forest anthem which will be released in the month of November, he added.
