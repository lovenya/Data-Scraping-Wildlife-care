“They do not want to be separated but it is unethical to let them go on,” said the posting, addressed to users of China’s hugely popular weibos — microblogging services similar to Twitter that have taken the country by storm.

The romantic liaison hit headlines this week after a local television station in the southwestern province of Yunnan picked up on the story, reporting that attempts to separate the pair had been unsuccessful.

The ram — whose name Changmao means Long Hair — “integrated himself into deer society” after being placed in a pen with the animals. “The sheep and the deer have been in love since last year,” said a park keeper. The pair would now be allowed to stay together.
