In a highly networked world, even avian flu is not spared. As human beings encroach upon wildlife habitats, the danger of transmission of viruses from humans to wildlife and vice versa has also increased, resulting in dangerous diseases among wildlife populations.

Martin Gilbert who was in Bangalore recently, has extensively studied the spread of diseases among wild birds and domestic chicken by studying the migration of bar-headed geese and other water birds across Asia, especially in the remote regions of Cambodia, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China. He is the Associate Director for Asia, Global Health Programme of Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Â 
Birdwatchers from Karnataka have contributed to his study by photographing banded geese that were released in Mongolia. Gilbert was in India to attend a WCS strategic planning meeting on new landscape conservation projects in Asia. He shared details of his work and the wildlife and health challenges faced due to close proximity of humans and wildlife in parts of Asia.

It is believed that wild birds are the cause for outbreak of diseases such as avian influenza. Your thoughts...
Avian influenza in wild birds such as geese, swans and ducks does not cause any major disease. Because they are in such low numbers and spread out, they do not become reservoirs of such viruses and chances of mutation to virulent strains is low. The problem of avian influenza is enormous among domestic chicken because of high density stocking in cages. There is a huge opportunity for viruses to mutate to deadly strains causing largescale deaths. My work in Mongolia on the H5N1 avian influenza has shown that wild birds get infected from domestic birds when they come in contact with domestic birds as they migrate to their wintering grounds in warmer regions. In 2005 when there was an outbreak of new strain of avian flu in Qinghai province of China, about 6000 bar headed geese died because of transmission of the virus from chicken to wild birds.

Tell us about your neck collar studies
Being a veterinarian, I am keen on studying migration of water birds from colder regions to warmer regions from a health point of view. I am working with wild bird populations in Mongolia. The neck collar studies is a widely used technique for swans and geese. Birds are caught and coloured plastic collars bearing numbers are fitted around the neck of these birds. ADVERTISEMENTBecause these neck collars are visible from afar, birds fitted with them can be observed and identified without capturing them again. From our studies we have seen that bar-headed geese that were collared in Mongolia by our team were found to have travelled all the way to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Assam flying over some of the tallest Himalayan peaks. Thanks to birdwatchers in India and especially Karnataka who photographed these collared birds, we were able to know that bar-headed geese from Mongolia travel all the way to India during winter. Out of the 600 birds that were neck collared in Mongolia, 20 of them were photographed in Karnataka by birdwatchers. So amateur birdwatchers and nature photographers can contribute immensely to this science.

What about the risks in India?
India has a large human population. Habitats are getting restricted to becoming islands in an expansive human populated landscape. As there is a greater chance of livestock and wildlife mingling, diseases from livestock can quickly spread to wildlife and exterminate wildlife. On the positive side, there is a large number of veterinarians in India. Training vets around wildlife areas in wildlife health issues can help in addressing some of this concern.
