However, the work was stopped as it was brought to the notice of trhe forest department. 

Now once again the work on destruction of Shola forest to carry out development works has been commenced. 

Bhadra Wildlife Conservation Trust’s D V Girish, Hulikere Wild Cat-C’s Sridev and Nature Conservation Guild members alleged that the sensitive environment is being destroyed for selfish purpose. 

By felling Shola Forest, the Supreme Court order has been violated. The forest is highly sensitive and provides shelter to several wild animals.

The district administration should come forward to stop the construction works, they urged and also warned of taking legal steps if it fails to take action.
