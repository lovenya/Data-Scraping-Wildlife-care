The High Court on Thursday quashed proceedings against Mieky Yung Koak, a 61-year-old South Korean accused of possessing horns of a Chital (spotted deer). Mieky was arrested by the Bengaluru International Airport police in April 2015 after they found horns of the deer during her luggage scan. 

ADVERTISEMENTShe was arrested and booked under various provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. She was granted bail by the lower court after she said that she found the horns during a walk in Ooty and that she was neither involved in any hunting nor had she picked the horns from any sanctuary.

Justice Anand Byrareddy quashed the proceedings on the grounds that the entire case was misconceived.
