Travelling by boat provides a fabulous opportunity to see the country differently.”Morada said Bangladesh isn’t a “tick-the-sight-off-the-list type of destination of the world”.“This will allow the country to reveal its intricate weave of majority Muslims, Christian Adivasi tribal, Buddhists and Hindu cultures. Hilsa fishing with otters, floating markets and clay pottery is part and parcel of Bangla life,” he said.In October last year, India and Bangladesh signed a new river route protocol, according to which tourist vessels from Assam will sail through Bangladesh for Kolkata. MV Mahabaahu is a joint venture between Adventure Resorts & Cruises Private Limited and Assam Tourism Development Corporation.However, the official inauguration of the cruise service was postponed due to the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha elections. The Brahmaputra is part of the National Waterways-2 of the Inland Waterways Authority of India.During the 1,250-km journey through five major rivers, tourists will enjoy the beauty of Sundarbans, the largest mangrove in the world having Royal Bengal tigers, the Gangetic and Irrawaddy dolphins and crocodiles.The Mosque City of Bagerhat, a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site famous as the ‘mint town of the Bengal Sultanate’ or Khalifabad, located at the confluence of Ganga and Brahmaputra in Khulna division of Bangladesh is another major stopover.“They can also enjoy jeep and elephant safari inside Manas National Park in Assam, another World Heritage Site. It is famous for its 55 mammals and 420 species of birds. It is also a home to Royal Bengal tigers, golden langurs, capped langur, hoolock gibbons, one-horned rhinos, barasingha, wild water buffaloes and four types of hornbill,” Morada said.
