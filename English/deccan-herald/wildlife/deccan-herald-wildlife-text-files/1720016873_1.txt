“We have sent the samples of Divya, the two-year-old tigress, which was the first to succumb to the infection, and the sample of three-month-old tiger cub that also died due to bacterial infection,” he said.  

The histopathology report conducted on Divya is expected in a week’s time, he added.
B K Singh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden said the death of the two animals two days ago was not due to bacterial infection. “The panther died due to neurological problem, while the lion which was 26-years-old died of old age. However, we are lucky enough to save Arya, the white tiger whose condition was critical owing to salmonella infection. Besides, Arya there were 15 other infected tigers which have recovered.

Since September, two tigers Divya, Minchu and a cub have died due to bacterial infection caused after consuming infected chicken. Also, three lions, a panther and a nilgai have died recently.ADVERTISEMENT
