Mallick (35), snake catcher and a prominent member of Snake Helpline, was bitten by the poisonous snake while conducting an awareness programme for anganwadi workers at BJB Nagar here.

The cobra which was caught by Mallick earlier in the day, bit him when he pulled it out from a bag in front of anganwai workers to present a demonstration after a theory class.

"Mallick's condition was stable and he had been injected 10 anti-venoms," said a doctor attending him.

This was for the fourth time that Mallick had been hospitalised due to snakebite, said his colleague Bhabani Patnaik.ADVERTISEMENT
