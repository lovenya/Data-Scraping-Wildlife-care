A leopard has been stuck in a 75-feet long cable-carrying pipe underneath the IAF runway here for the past 11 days.

ADVERTISEMENTForest officials said frantic efforts were on in a bid to free the big cat stuck in the underground pipe at the Indian Air Force station’s subsidiary runway here. Officials from the nearby Chhatbir Zoological Park on Thursday laboured hard for new methods to rescue the animal after earlier efforts failed.

Chandigarh’s chief wildlife warden Santosh Kumar said they were hopeful that the leopard will be taken out alive soon.

Over the past few days, the officials have devised several techniques, including keeping a chicken and a goat near the pipe as bait, flushing water down the pipe and bursting crackers but the leopard has refused to come out. Experts from the Wildlife Institute of India also visited the site on Wednesday.

About a fortnight back, IAF personnel saw the animal at the station and the wildlife department was informed about it. The leopard was then spotted inside the pipe under the IAF runway.

“He can survive without any food for about 15 days. Though he has taken water, but the leopard has refused to take any food. We have confined him to a 25-foot area now and are hoping he will come out soon. We are trying different methods and keeping our fingers crossed,” Kumar said.

He said it was not known how the leopard landed in the IAF area. “But it looks like that he has been inside the pipe on earlier occasions too,” the official said. A team of veterinary doctors was also present at the site.
