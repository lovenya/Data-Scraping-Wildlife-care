In a press release issed by Sridev Hulikere and D V Girish said “the elephants used for timber work are being tourtured by not taking care properly. “In the last 10 years, four elephants which were used for timber work have died in the district. They undergo torture when they pull the timber logs. However, the owner never understands the torture which elephants undergo. Now the technology has undergone lot of changes. Instead of elephants, cranes, JCB can be used to shift the wooden logs. The use of elephants are a heinous act,” they opined. 

These elephants are not provided with proper food. An elephant requires 250 kg food per day. Forest department is not taking any measure in this regard, they added.
