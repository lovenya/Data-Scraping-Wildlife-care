After undergoing the operation at a government vet clinic here yesterday, the reptile is making progress but it needs a few more days of careful nursing, the doctors said. The 5.5 feet-long cobra was caught by snake enthusiast and conservationist Vava Suresh from the outskirts of the city a few days ago.

The intestine had partly come out as the snake was injured by the earth mover engaged at the worksite. Though the reptile was immediately taken to the vet clinic, the doctors had to wait for some time as they required permission from the Wildlife Deartment for performing the surgery.

The doctors said it was a delicate procedure that they had to perform as the snake did not get fully tranquilized even after administering anaesthesia. The snake has been given back to Suresh, who will put it back into the forest after it recovered.ADVERTISEMENT
