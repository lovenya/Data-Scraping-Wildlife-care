State Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurubooru Shantha Kumar has urged the authorities to suspend the work on high-tension line in South Kodagu. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe 400-kv high-tension line is a part of wheeling power from Kudankulam nuclear power project. The project will result in felling of thousands of trees which will in turn affect the lifeline of the district—Cauvery river. The protesters submitted a petition to DC Anurag Tiwari, demanding to suspend the work. 

Speaking on the occasion, Shantha Kumar said that if the forest is destroyed, then river will go dry. Lakhs of people are dependent on river Cauvery for drinking water purpose. 
Coorg Wildlife Society president Col (retd) C P Muthanna said that the government has failed to take locals to confidence before taking up the work. Even Gram Panchayat members and MLAs have not given their nod for the project. 

Ammathi Raitha Sangha president K U Ganapathy said the work should be stopped immediately. Cauvery Sene convenor Ravi Changappa said “realising the threat from the project, the sugarcane growers from Mandya district have extended their support to us.”
Anti-policy

Protesting against the suicide of a sugarcane grower outside the Assembly, Kurubooru Shantha Kumar said that anti-people’s policy followed by the State government led to the tragic incident. 

The protesters staged a protest in front of General Thimmaiah Circle and flayed the government for fixing unscientific price for sugarcane. The government had failed to come to the rescue of the farmers. The government is directly responsible for the suicide of the farmer. 

He urged the government to announce compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of the deceased farmer and increase the price of sugarcane. 

If the government fails to respond, then we will intensify our protest.
