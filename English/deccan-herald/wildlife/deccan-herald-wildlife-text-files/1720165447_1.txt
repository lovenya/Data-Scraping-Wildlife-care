The Forest Acts implemented by the governments in the post-independence era have caused devastation in the lives of tribals, Dakshina Bharata Adivasi Parishat president Gunashekharan said. 

ADVERTISEMENTHe was speaking at the state executive committee meeting of Karnataka Adivasi Rakshana Parishat at Kuvempu Kalamandira in town on Sunday. 

Gunashekharan said tribals have been living in coordination with the nature and have been preserving the forests and wildlife. They have the rights to engage in agriculture on their land, he observed.

He said, “During the colonial period, the rights of the tribals were not snatched away. However, our own governments have snatched away lives from the tribals by formulating Forest Acts which have been detrimental for tribals. Some non-government organisations too have been cheating the tribals. United struggles have become inevitable to make the government fulfill our needs.”

‘No amenities’

Kerala Tribal Federation State President Kuruvaran regretted that tribal communities have been deprived of basic amenities. In Kerala and Tamil Nadu,  the responsibility of distributing houses to tribals has been handed over to private organisations. But, the tribals have not been successfull in getting the houses. Several clauses on tribal rights are not being implemented. There is a need to give a serious thought in this regard, he remarked.

Dr K N Matri of Hampi Budakattu Adhyayana Kendra said Hakkipikki and Dongri Gareshia tribes have been provided land by the government following a movement by the Adivasi Parishat. The Adivasi tribes Gowdlu, Medha, Hasalaru and others should unite among themselves to solve their problems. Also, Maitri urged the government for the effective implementation of Forest Rights Act 2006 and to provide lands for tribals. 

Adivasi Parishat State  President M Krishnaiah, Vice President Siddi, district unit President Rajamma, zilla panchayat member Amita Puttappa and DCF M S Manik were present at the event.
