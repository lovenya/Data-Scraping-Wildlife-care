Gehlot was in this district to discuss issues related to wildlife and infrastructure and facilities in the Ranthambore National Park when reporters drew his attention to noise pollution during the wedding beyond midnight. Following this, he directed District Collector Ravi Kumar to conduct an inquiry.

Brand, a British comedian and Perry, an American pop star, exchanged wedding vows according to Hindu traditions at the luxury Aman-e-Khas resort near the Park on Saturday night.

Sources said loud music blared in the resort till 2:30 am on Sunday in clear violation of rules, which would have disturbed wild animals in the adjoining forest area.

“Though no specific complaint was made in this regard by locals, but as per the directive of the chief minister following inputs from some journalists, forest and district administration officials have been asked to probe into the matter,” Kumar said. “The officials would submit their report as soon as they find some substantial input in this regard. I had already appointed a four-member committee to look into violation of rules in the eco-sensitive area and the members visited the venue on Saturday.ADVERTISEMENT
