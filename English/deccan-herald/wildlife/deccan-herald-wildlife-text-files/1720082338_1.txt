Cheetahs arriving from Namibia to Madhya Pradesh's Kuno-Palpur National Park later this week will have to spend their entire air transit period empty stomach, a senior forest department official said on Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTEight cheetahs will be brought to Jaipur in Rajasthan from Namibia in Africa on September 17 in a cargo aircraft as part of an inter-continental translocation project and flown to the Kuno-Palpur National Park (KPNP) in Sheopur district the same day.After taking off from Namibia, food to the felines will be given in KPNP, where they will reach after an hour-long journey in a helicopter from Jaipur, some 400km from the national park, the official said. As a precaution, it is mandated that an animal should have an empty stomach at the time of commencing the journey, MP Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) JS Chauhan told PTI.Also Read | Cheetah import would continue for 15 years to establish a viable meta-population, says MoEFHe said no food will be given to the cheetahs during their journey from Namibia to Jaipur and then further to the national park. Such a precaution is needed as long journeys may create nausea-like feelings in animals leading to other complications, Chauhan said.Asked about travel time between Namibia and Jaipur, the forest officer said he has no idea in this regard, but the cargo plane bringing the big cats is scheduled to land at the airport in the Rajasthan capital between 6 am to 7 am on September 17.However, an online travel agency's website showed that the one-side journey of a passenger aeroplane from Windhoek (Namibia's capital) to New Delhi takes 16 hours 40 minutes with a four-hour stop mid-way. Chouhan said after shifting the cheetahs from the cargo plane to the helicopter and completing other formalities, the animals will reach helipads in Kuno-Palpur after an hour-long journey.Also Read: From extinction to re-introduction: Brief history of Indian cheetahOfficials of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change were looking after arrangements related to the inter-continental cheetah translocation project and were in touch with Namibian authorities, he said.The MP's forest officer said on arrival the cheetahs will be first kept in small enclosures for a month and then in bigger ones for a couple of months for acclimatization and familiarisation with their surroundings.
