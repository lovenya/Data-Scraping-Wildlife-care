The High Court of Karnataka imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on government officials to be paid to a farmer from Chikkamagaluru.

Justice B Veerappa, while hearing a petition filed by the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Bhadra Wildlife division, Assistant Commissioner cum Land Acquisition Officer – both from Chikkamagaluru, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and the Chief Secretary, dismissed their plea. The judge directed the officials to pay Rs 25,000 to V B Venkatesha.

The petitioners had sought directions to quash a lower court order which had directed them to pay the compensation amount for acquiring a house belonging to Venkatesha on survey number 79, Voddihatti, Madla village, Chikkamagaluru. The judge came down heavily on the government officials for not following the lower court orders when it was still pending.  The court, in its order said, “This is nothing but a daring raid on the court by the authorities of the state government. It is the duty of the government to protect the interest of every law-abiding citizen of the state and should not harass such persons.”
