A 22-year-old boxing coach at a Himachal Pradesh school has been arrested for involvement with a gang of leopard poachers police said on Saturday.

ADVERTISEMENTPolice have also recovered three leopard skins -- expected to fetch over Rs 9 lakh in the international market -- from the possession of Meetu Singh, who hails from Balsa village in Shimla.

“We had received a tip-off on Friday that a person dealing in leopard skins would be coming to G T  Karnal bypass. 

“A trap was laid and Meetu was apprehended along with well preserved leopard skins,” said Ashok Chand, additional commissioner of police (crime).

Meetu told police that he and his associates were involved in trapping leopards for the past five years. They hunted leopards from the forests of Shivalik Hills in Himachal Pradesh.

“They are aware of the waterholes frequently visited by the leopard. To catch the leopards, they would lay metal clamps or traps with chains under branches and shrubs,” Chand said. Once a leopard is caught, the poachers would beat the animal to death.

Meetu disclosed that the gang has hunted and killed more than 10 leopards so far. 

“The skin was sold in Shimla, Mcleodganj and Dharamshala. Further investigation of the case is in progress,” Chand added.

A case under of the Wildlife Protection Act has been registered against Meetu.
