It is the largest wildlife sanctuary in Sikkim.The Royal Bengal Tiger was captured by trap cameras of a team of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) which is conducting a study in the sanctuary in collaboration with the Sikkim Forest department, they said.The BNHS team claimed that it was the first time that a tiger has been spotted at an altitude of 3,640 metres (11,942 feet)."The tiger may be utilising the higher ranges of the sanctuary as a corridor to enter the forests of North Sikkim from Bhutan. Previous tiger sightings in the North Sikkim region indicate a potential connection between the adjoining Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary and Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary."Also Read:Girl, 8, killed in leopard attack in UP's BalrampurAlso Read:Girl, 8, killed in leopard attack in UP's Balrampur"To gain a deeper understanding of tiger movement in the high-altitude region of the Sikkim Himalayas, further long-term intensive monitoring studies are deemed necessary," said Atharva Singh, BNHS scientist associated with the survey.The BNHS team was conducting a biodiversity assessment of the sanctuary as part of a project called "Conservation and Use of Five Wetlands in three Himalayan states to secure Habitats of Birds Migrating within the Central Asian Flyway (CAF)."
