There has never been a dearth of hobbyist photographers. But in the last couple of years, the number of people taking photography up as a medium of creative expression, has more than doubled.

Digital cameras have turned many amateurs into ‘wannabe pros’. 

Many camera stores in the City have seen an increase in their sales as well. Narayan, who manages an electronic store in a mall, says that not only has there been an increase in the sale of the digital cameras but even the sale of phones that come with a high megapixel camera. “Now that most high-end cameras are becoming more affordable for the common man, we see a lot of professionals willing to invest in them,” adds Narayan. 

In the last one year itself, the ‘Bangalore Photography Club’ has seen a 55 per cent increase in its membership. Says Mayur, the founding member of the club, “In a week, we have around 300 to 350 people waiting to get an approval of membership into the club. That itself says how photography as a hobby has many takers. Now, the camera has become so advanced too when compared to the times when one used to depend on reels. One wouldn’t really need to do much to get that picture perfect moment.” 

Even websites like Facebook, Flickr and Picasa where photos can be uploaded and commented upon, have been an important factor for this trend. For Dhruv, a post graduate student, the tryst with photography began when he used his phone, which had a 3.6 megapixel camera, to click a photo. 
“When I first started clicking pictures of my classmates using my mobile phone and uploading them on Facebook, I used to get a lot of comments on how nice they were. That’s when I felt encouraged and managed to save up and buy myself a good camera. I have continued with it as a hobby,” adds Dhruv.

Candid photography for weddings is also catching up big time. Devendra Purbiya, who turned his hobby into a profession, says that couples these days are highly aware and this makes them think outside the box. “Those moments are things that will never return and many couples today are open about get candid pictures clicked instead of the same old posed shots,” he adds.  While most amateur photographers enjoy taking pictures of wildlife, Ayush, a second year student, loves to take pictures of everyday things. “I enjoy taking off-beat pictures. Somehow more than nature and wildlife, I find beauty in simple things like a plastic bottle, children and even the various human emotions,” says Ayush, who has been taking pictures for the last eight years.

Passion is one thing that drives them all. While very few take it up as a career option, there are some who feel that they cannot earn their bread and butter through it. “Somewhere I don’t want turn my hobby into a profession. 

Photography is a stress buster for me and by making it a profession, I feel I may lose the 
passion for it,” sums up Prabhasa, a third year engineering student.
