 Now, people fear that Naxal activities will increase if the Tiger Project is implemented. 

The Naxals have already pasted posters against Tiger project, National Park, Bio park and reserve forest at Kigga on Friday.  

The people of the region have been demanding the Centre to drop the proposal. 

In Malnad, houses and schools are situated in far away places. The children have to walk inside the forest to reach home. Without bringing the truth to the people, it is not right on the part of the government to implement the project by putting the people to hardship, says advocate K P Suresh Kumar.

 “We are not against Tiger Project. However, there is a need to create awareness on the project, the extension of area under the project among the people living in vicinity of the Project,” he says. 

When 500.16 square kilometre area was declared as Bhadra Tiger Reserve, as many as 400 families from 11 villages were rehabilitated at M C Halli and Kelagoor. The extension of Bhadra Tiger Reserve order was passed on January 29, 2011. 

Accordingly, 571.84 square kilometre area has been included in the Bhadra Tiger Reserve Buffer Zone. This include Narasimharajapura, Tarikere, Bhadravathi, Shimoga, Chikmagalur. It also includes both private and revenue land. Few have been trying to misguide the people that Tiger project will include only the reserve forest area. 

It was B S Yeddyurappa had convened a meeting of State Wildlife Board on July 26, 2011 to decide on the extension of Tiger Reserve Forest and okayed the proposal in the meeting.
