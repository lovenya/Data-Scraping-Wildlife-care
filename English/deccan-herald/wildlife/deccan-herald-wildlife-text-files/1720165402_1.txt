Dear Sir, 
I have finished my BBA and joined MBA programme in Human Resource Management (HRM). I am confused whether to continue with HRM or to opt for Healthcare Management next year. Many of my relatives have advised me to take up Healthcare. Please suggest which one has better scope in terms of job and salary.  
A student

Dear Student, 
If you are deeply interested in Healthcare, it would have been better if you had taken up Master of Hospital Administration (MHA) instead of a general MBA. MHA is offered by many good colleges in Bengaluru and elsewhere. If you are still keen on getting into the healthcare sector, then after your MBA, look for a job in the HR department of a hospital or healthcare institution and get a feel of that sector. Subsequently, you can decide whether to upgrade your qualifications or get more exposure and experience through work.

Dear Sir,
I am a student of third year BE (Biotechnology). I tried for BVSc after II PU, but didn’t secure admission. I love animals and want to pursue Masters in a course related to animals either in India or abroad. I want to build a career in that line. Can you please suggest the available options.
A student

Dear Student, 
You can certainly work with animals, but you will not be able to become a veterinary doctor unless you are willing to go back and study the entire four years of BVSc. You can get into postgraduate courses in animal welfare, wildlife management, cognitive sciences, animal nutrition, sustainable or environment development etc. Start exploring  good colleges that offer these courses so that you can appear for entrance exams when you are in the final year.

Dear Sir,
I am in the first semester of BE (Mechanical engineering). Sadly, now I realise that I am more interested in Computer Science or Electronics than the mechanical stream. I am also interested in automobiles, but it is said that India is not quite a place for it. Should I change my branch before it’s too late or pursue my Masters in European countries in Automobiles after finishing my BE in Mechanical? 
Sharath

Dear Sharath,
Mechanical engineering can be a good foundation to get into the automobile sector.  Don’t be misled by people who say that “India is not quite a place for it.” You will be amazed at the rate at which change and development is taking place. Designers sitting in India are creating new models of automobiles in USA and other countries. Ancillary industries in India are making precision parts for automobile and aerospace sectors. Select your domain specialisation based on your interest (which should of course be backed with talent, skills, potential and aptitude) and you will be successful.

Dear Sir,
I am currently studying in Class 12 (PCMB) and I wish to do BSc in Biotechnology. May I know the procedure to get into this field — exams I need to answer, colleges where I can apply (in Karnataka) and what I can do after completing this course? I would also like to know about the job opportunities available in India.
Spoorthi Shetty

Dear Spoorthi,
There are dozens of colleges in Karnataka offering BSc in Biotechnology. It is a basic sciences course that gives you the fundamentals of areas such as genetics, microbiology, biochemistry etc. It is better if you explore and decide what would be the area of your specialisation, what type of work suits you most, and then join the degree course. Also be prepared for higher studies without which your degree may get you only entry-level jobs. Simultaneously, explore the alternative of doing a BE/BTech in biotechnology, which gives you more practical and application oriented knowledge.

Dear Sir,
I completed PU (Science) with 64%. Now I have joined BCom and am doing CA alongside. It will take another four years to complete CA. Please inform me about various jobs that I can take up and expected salary.

Dear Dhanush,
Actually, students can enrol for Common Proficiency Test (CPT) of Chartered Accountancy immediately after passing Class 10 (details on www.icai.org). If the person clears in the first attempt, she or he knows that she or he is a CA material and can proceed further. Anyway, now that you have enrolled for CA along with BCom, do attempt CPT and see your performance. That way, you will know whether you will be able to complete CA within four years. Be clear and realistic about your goals. Since you have switched over from Science to Commerce, it will be good if you identify your strengths and aim for a specific career, such as chartered accountancy, banking, insurance and business analytics, cost accountancy, investments, teaching etc. Based on that, you can start building necessary skills and acquire necessary qualifications. The jobs you can get depend on what you wish to specialise in, and the better you are at your work, more is the salary you will earn.ADVERTISEMENT
