Mainstream political parties in Kerala are up in arms against the recent notification of the centre to make the 3.4-kilometre area around the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary ecological sensitive zone.ADVERTISEMENTWhile the Congress-led United Democratic Front has called for a local 'hartal' on February 8 demanding the centre to withdraw the notification, CPM-led Left Democratic Front burnt copies of the draft in protest on Friday. BJP local leaders said that they would convey their stand soon.Various farmersâ€™ organisation and religious outfits are also expected to join the protests.The draft notification issued by the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ministry would bring 118.59 square kilometres under the Eco-Sensitive Zone.It includes 99.5 square kilometres outside the sanctuary.Six human-inhabited villages also come under the zone and restrictions on activities like mining, industrial units and other polluting industries in the region would be imposed.Environmentalists welcomed the notification and condemned the protest by political parties. "It is unfortunate that political parties are coming together against decisions to protect the environment," said Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti president N Badusha.
