Pandey has been sent to 14 days’ judicial custody. 

“Pandey said Mohta lived in Mumbai for most part of the year and paid regular visits to his residence in Delhi,” said a senior police officer. 

Officials said the seized items were worth several lakhs in the international market. 

Police conducted raids at 20, Ferozeshah Road, on Friday, after People for Animals (PFA), a non-governmental organisation,  tipped them off.

“We found three geese, four tusks of elephant calves and a large elephant tusk, numerous ivory items and two live ostriches,” said the officer.

A case under Sections 50, 39, 51, 40 and 49 B of the Wildlife (Protection) Act has been registered at Barakhamba Road police station, police official said. 

Wildlife Act

The Wildlife Protection Act does not ban ostriches but geese have been banned, he said.
PFA president Gaurav Gupta said, “Delhi is a major transit point for the trafficking of endangered animals and their derivatives.

“Most smuggled animals and products come to Delhi from western Uttar Pradesh and the tribal areas of Rajasthan.”  

Delhi registered between 150 and 200 criminal cases related to the trafficking in animals in 2011.

Giving another example of such incidents, Gupta said: “Two men were arrested at Shahdara on November 27 for trying to smuggle venom derived from about a hundred cobras which they had transported to Delhi via an interstate bus from Meerut which was bound for Nepal.”
