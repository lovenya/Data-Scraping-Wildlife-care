For Siddeshswamy of Karya village in Nanjangud taluk, concern for wildlife and livestock is not restricted to paying lip sympathy. 

ADVERTISEMENTHe has gone much beyond that and translated his empathy for these animals into action.

He has constructed a small tank from where wild animals can drink water and a pond to cater to the water needs of cattle. There are twin objectives behind Siddeshswamy’s initiative.

 On the one hand, it prevents the wild animals from entering farms in villages bordering forests in search of water - especially during summer - and getting electrocuted due to the electric fencing. On the other, it can stop the animals from eating away crops in the fields or destroying them by stamping on them.

He had a brainwave 15 years ago. He decided to construct a 20x30 sq ft tank and a 20x20 sq ft pond for wild animals and livestock respectively near his field at the foot of the Kolalu Gopalaswamy Betta hillock (Ummattur Gudda) - with the help of his father Rangaiah and brother Mahadeva. 

Soon, he realised that it would be dangerous for both wild animals and livestock to drink water from the same source. So he constructed a pond - for the cattle from in and around his village - in his field. The source of water for his tank and pond are the borewells in his field.

 The SC/ST Corporation had provided financial aid for sinking a borewell, while two more borewells were drilled in his field under the Ganga Kalyan project. A 600-metre pipe supplies water from the borewells to the tank and pond.

“There are wild boars and deer in Ummattur Gudda. They used to eat up the crops in the fields where they came to drink water. We used to lose sleep at night keeping a vigil in the fields. Sometimes, the crops used to be destroyed by leopards. 

After we created the sources of water, their menace has been curbed to a great extent. It’s now a pleasure to see the animals returning after drinking water to their heart’s content,” said Siddeshswamy.
