"One tiger is untraceable since December last year and the others are missing since February this year. They do not have radio collars and our effort to trace them is on," Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife warden U M Sahai said.

No signs of territorial fight have been detected yet and the teams of forest department are making efforts to locate them, he added.

"In monsoon season, tracking big cats becomes difficult. They are missing for months even then it would be too early to anticipate that they are dead because it (missing) happens many times due to various reasons," Deputy Conservator of Forest- Ranthambore Y K Sahu said.

"No dead body has been found yet," he said.

"We are hopeful that they would be traced after monsoon gets over. Tigers T21, T29, T40 and tigress T27 are missing," Sahu said, adding, there are more than 40 tigers, tigresses and cubs (in all) in Ranthambore.

The famous Ranthambore national park is located in Sawaimadhopur district, 130 kms from here in Rajasthan.ADVERTISEMENT
