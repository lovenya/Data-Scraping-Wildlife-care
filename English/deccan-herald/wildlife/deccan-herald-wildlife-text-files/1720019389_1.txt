In a major victory for conservationists, the High Court recently upheld  a July 2008 order by Deputy Commissioner, Mysore, for the closure of the Mysore-Mananthavadi highway (SH 17D) -passing through the Nagarahole National Park- during night.

In their submission, the petitioners had stated that the Mysore- Mananthavadi road has been in public use for a long time, as it was opened in the days of Tipu Sultan for transportation and communication. 

They further mentioned that the road had been in neglect for a long time until people protest in 2007 prompted the authority to act. 

However, it has since been stopped by vested interests acting in the name of conservation. 

Pointing out that the matter is still pending in the Supreme Court, the petition alluded to the July 11, 2008 order by Mysore Deputy Commissioner P Manivannan closing traffic on the road between 6 pm to 6 am and   another Sep 1, 2008 order prohibiting vehicles except two busses and ambulance to ferry patients and said people have been put to great hardship as a result of the orders and their personal liberty has been affected. 

The petitioners also alleged that a powerful lobby comprising of land owners adjacent to the forest are working to ensure that the people are deprived of enjoying wildlife along this stretch and the vehicles ply close to their lands.

They also said the alternative route would be a detour to Mysore and people have to travel at about 80 kms and pay more.

Round about
“ If we are going through the forest road, it would be have been direct route to Mysore, now the vehicles from Mananthavadi have to go through Sultan Batheri and Gundlupet to reach Mysore,” said the petitioners and sought to quash the DC order.

Following submission by Government counsel R G Kolle that the state has already provided the commuters with an alternative road and there is no need to open the traffic within the national park which is also a tiger reserve, the division bench disposed off the matter with a direction to maintain the road as per the Central Empowerment Committee.

On July 11, 2008, Deputy Commissioner of Mysore Manivannan  ordered to close the Mysore-Mananthavadi highway taking into account the road kill and fragmentation impact on wildlife due to vehicular movement. 

The order was issued based on a proposal by wildlife expert and member of State Board for Wildlife Sanjay Gubbi and in consultation with government officials, transporters and other stakeholders.  

Scientific studies show large mammals avoid highways during the day due to vehicular movement, but tend to prowl across the road during the night when traffic is considerably less. 

Closure of traffic during night is therefore recommended to spare the wildlife from being killed by running vehicles. 

The court has also ordered that an alternate road, which is currently in bad condition, should be repaired before the next monsoon season. 

Ironically, the same petitioner had approached the Supreme Court with the matter hiding the fact that it was pending in Karnataka High Court. 

Even before the High Court came out with the order, Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda, following his meeting with his Kerala counterpart Oomen Chandy, sanctioned Rs 21 crore to repair the alternative road.
