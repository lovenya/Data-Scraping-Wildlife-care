Travel photograph of the weekADVERTISEMENTPhotograph by Anuj AgrawalEarlier this year, Anuj Agrawal visited the beautifully remote island of Unauna in Indonesia. A part of the Togian island group, Unauna houses a scuba shop and well, little else. Waking up to views of the stretched-out sea, the water houses some extremely diverse wildlife and you go to sleep with the warm sounds of the sea right next to you.
