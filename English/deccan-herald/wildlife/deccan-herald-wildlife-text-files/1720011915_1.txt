At that long ago point in time, Man would have considered himself comfortable; from his origins as a hunter-gatherer he had, over time, slowly fashioned a world in which roots could be set down, in which procuring food and shelter was no longer the sole objective.

 People could instead turn their attention to other, more gratifying, pursuits: art, literature, music, even travel. Young men and women would have woven new dreams in their mind- of being playwrights, musicians and artists. The new, emerging opportunities around them would naturally have triggered new aspirations, new ambitions. 

If human kind had been comfortable during that period, then by the time the years rolled around to the 1960s,70s and 80s – a period when my generation was growing up – we were way more than that: basic food, shelter and clothing; education and health were for those of us in the developed world and some of us in the still developing world, things taken for granted.

 And for those who were fortunate enough not to have to spare a thought for these daily necessities the world had become a very exciting place indeed. Events were taking place around the world that would change the trajectories of our lives altogether. 

Changing times

From the late  60s and through the 70s, there was a churning all around. A new awareness seemed to be rising in the people; the establishment and all the things it stood for was being increasingly questioned, especially by younger people. Nuclear weapons were questioned, the Vietnam War was ferociously opposed, the misuse of the environment by industry and governments was slowly being brought into the public eye and the dominance of men over women was now a matter of intense discussion. 

While all these discussions, debates and demonstrations raged on, other significant events were taking place: the first man set foot on the moon, Britain had her first woman Prime minister and maybe more importantly for the common man and woman, the first microwave ovens appeared on the scene as also did the floppy disk. In our own country, a revolution, the Green Revolution, had begun to pave the road to a new security – food security. 

The following 10 years, the 80s, only saw an intensification of the processes that had begun in the preceding years. Global peace became the key word. Early on in the decade, an uprising led by Lech Walesa in Poland had secured legal status for the Unions, and from that point on the Communist order in Eastern Europe and Russia crumbled, ending with the decimation of the mighty Soviet Union. 

The Berlin Wall came down amidst loud cheers. Before this, the Soviets exited Afghanistan, a country they had invaded, but their leaving set the ball rolling in another set of events that culminated in the destruction of the World Trade Towers, years later. Still, good things were happening too: the first Post-its were released by 3M and we all know how that impacted our daily lives, and while colour television entered the UK, in India we were treated to the sight of the first television sets in peoples’ homes.  

All this hectic motion, all these upheavals changed the lives of the young women and men of my generation forever. Much to the occasional dismay of their parents, young people now embraced in their personal lives the profound changes they saw taking place in the world around them. A heady sense of freedom wafted around enticingly and the slightest sniff of it stirred up new longings in young hearts. 

Across our country, indeed across the world, new aspirations, powerful new ambitions unfurled stealthily. While skirts and salwaar-kameezes and mekhelas were being discarded for the new global uniform of denim- a uniform synonymous with Levis Jeans in those misty days- something more significant was being discarded: values and aspirations that were inherited from the older generation. 

The first obvious change was in how children and young adults perceived their future. For a start, there was a strong new feeling that an individual had the right to choose his own calling. Not in every household, for change is always slow to start, but in some, children wrested for themselves the right to choose for themselves, despite the still limited range of choices before them. 

No matter that they may have ended up choosing the very same careers that their parents would have wanted for them – medicine, law, engineering, journalism and teaching, but they reserved the right to debate these choices before making the final decision. 

And, in other households, other young people were striking out on little known, uncertain paths. On television screens, in pages of magazines they had seen new opportunities take shape and they seized them. 

Brave worlds

Armed with their convictions, these brave youngsters ventured into the worlds of textile design, fashion design, architecture, graphic design, marine biology, environmental science, music, painting and art history, among others. Women enlisted in the army, in the air force and the police service. Not very exciting by today’s standards, perhaps, but revolutionary in our time. 

A time when a choice between a career in medicine and one in textile design was a choice between having a stable life and an uncertain one. 

As for today’s children, the privileged ones for sure and even for those not as fortunate, for there are ways now to lift oneself out of the circumstances one has been born into– the world is indeed their oyster! All the clichés possible ring true for this generation of super-kids. The sky is the limit. Life is just a bowl of cherries. And so on and so forth. As in the song, A new world has really begun.

Vanishing boundaries

To begin with, all boundaries have shrunk and indeed, have disappeared- our new super fast modes of travel and more than that, of communication, have ensured that the world is a village. 

Children do not even think twice about a study or career choice that would require them to travel overseas; they can travel the distances fast, efficiently and frequently and while they are away from their loved ones they are able to communicate with them incessantly: mobile phones, email and skype, all these are the new umbilical cords that keep people firmly connected with friends and family. 

Cultural differences have been reduced now to a minimum: young people across the world dress the same, often wearing the same style of the same garment, at the same time; food is no longer an issue, pasta is eaten by everyone and so is rice. 

And last but not least, especially significant in our country, there is a shift in thinking that maybe the older professions are not the only ones to be taken seriously. All this is supported by the fact that every new avenue, these days, is also financially viable: a wildlife park ranger can make enough to eat as can a personal shopper!

New answers, old questions

What do you want to be when you grow up?  When this question is put to a group of ten year olds these days a veritable wonderland of answers springs up. A rock star   (very feasible these days), a footballer, preferably playing for Chelsea,  a ballerina, a concert pianist, an Indian classical vocalist, a kathak dancer, a potter ( who can design ceramic tiles to pay for his more artistic pursuits!). Some children want to be a wildlife park ranger while others would prefer being a vet in a zoo. 

Those with a strong sense of style aim to become stylists, interior decorators, even personal shoppers. For those children with their noses in storybooks, a vast terrain is open to them: novelists, playwrights, ghost-writers, editors, professional readers, agents, proof readers, resume writers and on and on and on. 

And the icing on the cake is that if they ever tire of their chosen fields they can switch, seamlessly and effortlessly to something more gratifying and they do: bankers transform themselves into writers, doctors into playwrights, footballers into actors and politicians into environmentalists. Truly, anything is possible these days and fitting in with this magical world our children now dream of futures we did not have the courage to dream of. 
Let them dream on! ADVERTISEMENT
