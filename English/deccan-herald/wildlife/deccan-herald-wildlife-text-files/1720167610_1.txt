Police have registered a case against four students of Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, who reportedly tortured and killed a monkey and buried her on their college premises a few days ago.

ADVERTISEMENT The inhuman treatment to the macaque came to light after animal activists lodged a complaint with the police after getting a tip-off from the CMC students.

 Accordingly, with the help of forest authorities and veterinarians, local animal protection activists led by Shravan Krishnan exhumed the monkey’s body, which was buried near the college canteen.

 Quoting eyewitnesses, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India on Thursday said  the female bonnet macaque wandered into the college hostel on November 19, and the four medical students caught her using a blanket. 

 “A study of her body shows that they tied her by the hands, legs, and neck. They also thrashed her with sticks and belts, impaled her with a sharp object, broke her legs and jaw and killed her,” it said.

 Shravan Krishnan also said: “Students inserted a rod up her (monkey's) anal canal before killing it.”

 The activists worked with the police to file an FIR at Bagayam Police Station. A case was registered under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960; Section 429 of The Indian Penal Code; and relevant sections of The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

 Meanwhile, after conducting a separate enquiry, CMC authorities suspended the students from the institution. 

This is the second incident of animal cruelty in Tamil Nadu, after two students in a college near Kundrathur on Chennai outskirts threw a dog from the terrace of a building, for which they were later arrested.
