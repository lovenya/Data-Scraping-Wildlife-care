A letter by S Dayashankar, Additional Secretary to the Government and private secretary to the chief minister, dated 15 December 2011, states that Chandy will be meeting Gowda to discuss the twin issues. 

The document, available with Deccan Herald, mentions that Chandy, who is visiting Bangalore for the South Zone States Chief Ministers Conference on December 18, had sought a meeting with Gowda through his private secretary on December 15. 

Interestingly, the chief minister on the same day has responded to it by directing the Additional Chief Secretary Forest Ecology and Environment department and Principal Secretary to Government Public Works department to furnish details for discussion which is scheduled at the chief minister’s home office ‘Krishna.’

After the two bans on June 30, 2010 and August 14, 2011, Kerala’s Transport Minister and Secretary met with Karnataka’s Chief Secretary and senior Forest department officials, National Highway Authority of India and others to lift the ban. 

However, the then Chief Minister B S  Yeddyurappa had stated that the State is bound to follow the High Court order and refused to lift the ban. Interestingly, following the example of Karnataka, the Government of Tamil Nadu banned the night traffic on its side of Mudhumalai tiger reserve. However Kerala is yet to show its concern. 

Before the ban was enforced, about a hundred animals had been killed by speeding vehicles, including two elephants, a tiger, two leopards, three sloth bears and 11 sambars. Most of these deaths happen at NH 212. 

On October 6, an elephant calf, which had come to Moolehole river was run over by a truck. The speeding driver had mercilessly dragged the animal which was stuck below the truck for about 500 meters. 

Since the new government assumed office in Kerala, the State has intensified its lobbying both at the Centre and at the State level to lift the ban. On September 26, 2011, through a letter (FNO.6-122/2011 WL I) the Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi, due to pressure from Kerala Government, tried to armtwist Karnataka to give in writing to open the night traffic through Bandipur. 

The National Wildlife Action Plan (2002-2016) drawn up under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister has mandated the “Ministry of Surface Transport and Ministry of Railways” to “plan roads in such a manner that all national parks and sanctuaries are by-passed and the integrity of the protected area is maintained.”ADVERTISEMENT
