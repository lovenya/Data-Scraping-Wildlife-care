But Vivian (aka Abhay) of Star One’s Pyaar Kii Ye Ek Kahaani has developed a liking for Vahbbiz Dorabjee (aka Panchi). In no time has their friendship blossomed into love. 

They have very few scenes together but still manage to spend quality time with each other. 

And they have lots in common. Both have VD as their initials and are born on the same date (that is on 28). They both love sports and Rajasthani food as well.

Commenting about his relationship with Vahbbiz, Vivian says, “Vahbbiz and I are together and she is really very special to me. My feelings for her date back to when the show had just begun and we had started shooting together. I like her for who she is as she is not a fake person and instead is very real and genuine.” Adds Vahbbiz, “Vivian is very special to me. Apart from being a fantastic actor, he is a clean-hearted person and a very genuine human being.” 

Well, it looks like Vivian and Vahbbiz are surely in love with each other. We wish this new couple, all the best.
