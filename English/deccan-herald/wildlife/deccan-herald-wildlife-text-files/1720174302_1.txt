Went for a safari ride in Bandipur and didn’t spot any animals? You can now take the help of Bengaluru-based wildlife tourism startup, ‘WildTrails’, before planning your next trip.
A platform for information on wildlife tourism, this application uses data analytics,
artificial intelligence and machine learning to help one get a glimpse of wildlife across India.ADVERTISEMENTLaunched two years ago, Manjunath Gowda, CEO of the information application, says that it is now used by enthusiasts in the city and across the world. <img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2FManjunath%20Gowda%2C%20CEO%20of%20WildTrails.jpg?w=1200" alt="Manjunath Gowda, CEO, WildTrails."/>Manjunath Gowda, CEO, WildTrails.Manjunath, a wildlife enthusiast himself, says, “We serve travel needs of people. We do everything like arranging resorts, safari rides, naturalists to go along with tourists for trips, cab pick-up and drop and more. We use technology to help spot animals.”The application covers information about 600 forests and sanctuaries in India and 1,650 across the world including spots of China, North and South America, areas in Africa and Europe.“Around Bengaluru, the top tourist places are Nagarhole, Kabini, Bandipur and Dandeli, and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and more across the state. Our details include where to go and how to go about spotting animals.”Based on information collected from guides, naturalists and locals from morning to evening across 365 days, data has been derived to compute and make spotting animals easier.“The application also suggests one about which gate of a sanctuary to use. There are 35 forests listed in the app. Kabini, Bandipur, BR Hills, Badra Hills and Dandeli are listed,” he says. There is graded information available on the application and more details are available to the naturalists/guides.“One can also compare which national park or forest has more animal spotted than the other,” says Manjunath. However, this information is not useful for poachers as the information covered is of tourist zones.“We do not provide any information about non-tourism zones at a place. Numbers of animals at these zones are easily known to wildlife experts and locals and poachers would not take such risks. The application does not share exact locations too, only the guides are aware of such intrinsic details,” he adds.Interest in wildlife increasing among citizens: CEO“In the last five years, there is a 20 per cent increase in wildlife tourism among Bengalureans. People from 35 to 60 love going for trips and activities connected to wildlife.” —Manjunath GowdaWhat to do while on a safari?- Be patient.
