Concerned over the manpower crisis, Union Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has written to Chief Minister B S Yedurappa on Thursday seeking his personal intervention to fill vacancies.

The sanctioned strength of forest personnel in Karnataka is 7,775. But as many as 2,122 posts are vacant, creating a staff shortage of 27 per cent. The state has 38,284 sqkm of forest, housing five national parks and 21 wildlife sanctuaries. It has two tiger reservesâ€”Bandipur Nagarhole and Bhadra. It also shares the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with Tamil Nadu and Kerala. But, barring Goa, all Karnataka neighbours fared better in filling forestry posts.ADVERTISEMENT
