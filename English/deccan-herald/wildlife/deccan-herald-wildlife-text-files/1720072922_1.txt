After it was known that cyclone Yaas will hit Bhitarkania National Park in Kendrapara district close to Dhamra port in Odisha, local people exude optimism that the rich mangrove forest cover along the wetland sites of the park would again turn into a saviour for them.ADVERTISEMENTThough the cyclonic storm is likely to make landfall on Wednesday, rain has started in the national park area since Tuesday morning and people are experiencing gusty wind."Everybody here is confined indoors either in homes or cyclone shelters. The forest cover around had protected us with minimal damage in past cyclones. We pray forest withstands the onslaught this time also," said Ganesh Chandra Gudia who lives in Talchua village beside the park. The national park had withstood the onslaught of cyclone Amphan that had barrelled through coastal Odisha in May last year.Also read: 2 electrocuted to death, 80 houses damaged as 'tornado' hits Bengal districts"The coastal woodland has the capacity to withstand wind speed up to 20 kilometres per hour.
