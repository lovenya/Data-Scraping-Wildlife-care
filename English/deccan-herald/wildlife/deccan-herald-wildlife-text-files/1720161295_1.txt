A six-year-old male leopard was rescued from an abandoned house near an abandoned quarrying site in Gulugunjanahalli, abutting Kengeri on SundayADVERTISEMENT. 

The leopard is now being treated at the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) Rescue Centre. 

The carnivore was found holed up in the house. Since the door is always locked, the leopard might have gained entry into the house through a broken window and was unable to escape. Local residents called up the park officials around 4 pm and took 20 minutes to dart and cage the carnivore. 

The officials said that since the leopard was locked behind the closed doors, in the absence of a crowd and the house being located in a deserted place, made it easy to trap the leopard. No casualties were reported. 

Dr Arun A Sha, veterinary director of Wildlife SOS, who is treating the leopard, said: “The animal is healthy, with all its canines and claws intact. It has a severe injury on its left paw, which needs immediate medical attention. It will take around two weeks for the wounds to heel.”
