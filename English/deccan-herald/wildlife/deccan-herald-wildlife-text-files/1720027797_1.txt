Happy days are ahead for elephants belonging to temples and 'mutts' in Tamil Nadu as they will head for a special rejuvenation camp starting this month as ordered by Chief Minister J.Jayalalithaa Saturday.

ADVERTISEMENTAt the camp, the elephants will be provided special diet and their health and mental condition will be checked and monitored.

The rejuvenation camp for elephants was first introduced in 2003 by the AIADMK government headed by Jayalalithaa to provide the elephants respite from their daily grind.

The 48-day special rejuvenation camp for the tuskers will be held in two batches this year, the state government said in a statement. 

In the first batch, 35 elephants belonging to 33 temples and 10 elephants belonging to five mutts will go for the camp to be held near Coimbatore from Nov 26.

In the second batch, 37 elephants will go for the camp to be held in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in Nilgiri district, around 570 km from here, from Dec 14.
