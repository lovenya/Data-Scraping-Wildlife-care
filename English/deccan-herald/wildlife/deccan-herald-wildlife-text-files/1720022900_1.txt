There seems to be no end to the controversy surrounding Apna Sapna, the resort group.

The Hills act as a spillover area for tigers and other wildlife from Bhadra Tiger Reserve. It connects Bhadra to Kemmannugundi, Churchegudda, Udevu and the famed Yemmedoddi Tiger Reserve. Unfortunately, many resorts - including Apna Sapna’s home stay - are located in the crucial corridor. Apna Sapna‘s ‘home stay’ is within a coffee plantation, which adjoins the reserve forests.

“If these resorts continue to fracture these buffers and corridors, the Bhadra Tiger Reserve will become an island with no connectivity to other areas. It is critical that the Bhadra Tiger Reserve should also soon declare its eco-sensitive zone like Bandipur,” said a wildlife expert.

The intention behind the home stay concept is to encourage local communities to create employment through tourism and promote interaction between tourists and locals. But, in the case of Apna Sapna, the basic spirit itself is violated. This ‘home stay’ has eight large rooms and a grand restaurant facing the valley of Bababudangiri.

The department of tourism, while permitting home stays, imposes certain conditions. These include: The owners should be residing in the property, not more than four rooms should be let out, local people should be employed and local cuisine should be served.
In the case of Apna Sapna, the owners do not stay in the property and all employees are from north east. Even the cuisine served does not match any of the Malnad flavours, but is from other states. The ‘home stay’ has eight rooms which is again a clear violation. 

Recently, the revenue and forest officials had demolished a resort coming up in the eco-sensitive zone of Bandipur for violating the Karnataka Land Revenue Act. In 2009, the owner of the Apna Sapna resort had obtained permission to construct a home for personal use, at Siddaiahanapura (survey number 218/5 and 218/6), on a land measuring about four acres.

 The owner started constructing a 20-room resort ignoring the notices issued by the forest officials that a resort cannot be constructed in the eco-sensitive zone. However, he still went ahead with the construction. The resort was demolished on May 18 this year.

When Deccan Herald contacted the authorities at Apna Sapna, they just confirmed that they run a ‘home stay resort with eight rooms’ at Bababudangiri. 
“We do not promise all luxuries. We serve North Indian, South Indian and Chinese food. Our tariff is Rs 2,500 per head on weekdays and Rs 3,000 in the weekends.” The owner of the resort was not available for comments.
