A petroglyph site with more than 20 unique rock artwork has been discovered near Kollur.ADVERTISEMENTThe carvings at Avalakki Pare near Kollur was discovered by Prof T Murugeshi, associate professor, Ancient History and Archaeology, MSRS College, Shirva, and team, recently. Avalakki Pare is 15 to 20 acres of grazing plain land in the wildlife reserve forest.Prof Murugeshi said that, among the engravings, 10 are human figures, including a baby figure. All the figures are shown in a hunting mood. Bull hunting, boar hunting, bird hunting and deer hunting are predominantly shown in the carvings. All the figures are engraved in double-line style.“Among the figures on the site, an outstanding figure is a female figure. It is engraved with special interest and care. On the right side of the belly, a cup-mark is done; on the left side, over the head, a rectangular cup-mark is created. This figure is believed to be of a religious significance,” the professor explained.The rock carvings must have belonged to 10,000 BC, he said.“On the west of the site, heaps of microlith deposit was also found. The spearheads, arrowheads, scrapers, blades, burins, stone sling balls and other types of microliths like lunates, points and cores were discovered in plenty,” said Prof Murugeshi.“Unfortunately, there was agricultural tools or tools used for domestic purpose. Majority of tools made out of Dolerite and small flake-tools,” he said.“Hunting scenes and the associated assemblages found on the site very clearly indicate that the site must have been connected to the hunter and gatherer culture of Mesolithic Period. Large numbers of Mesolithic sites were reported in the past by Dr K B Shivatarak, Dr L S Rao and Dr P Rajendran from the coastal region. But, for the first in the west coast of India, the petroglyphs of Mesolithic Age found in association with the flake tools from Coastal Karnataka,” added Prof Murugeshi.
