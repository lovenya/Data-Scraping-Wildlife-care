These will be added attraction for visitors," says Abhay Kumar, Director, Patna Zoo. The zoo which is basking in the success of the rhino breeding programme plans to part with one of its six female one-horned animals. Three are pregnant and expected to deliver next year as the animal has a long gestation period.

With a total 12 adult rhinos, the zoo has the credit of being the second largest rhino population among all the biological parks in the world. The Indian Rhino or the great Indian one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) is a large mammal primarily found in north-eastern India and Nepal. It is confined to the tall grasslands and forests in the foothills of the Himalayas.

We would soon commence the exchange process," Kumar adds. Sepahijala Zoological Park with the help of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has successfully initiated breeding of four rare animal species including spectacled monkey, clouded leopard, and the pigtailed macaque which are facing threat of extinction due to destruction of their habitat as well poaching.

Patna Zoo, also known as Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park has also shown its interest in acquiring a pair of leopard cat fromÂ  Sepahijala Zoological Park in exchange of a pair of golden and silver pheasant and a hippopotamus. "We already have three females and a pair would be an added advantage in ensuring different gene line among the species. Moreover, male leopard cat would help breeding in the animal," he says.

Weighing about three to four kgs and measuring about two and a half feet from head to tail, it is a little larger than the domestic cat. This feline is a nocturnal animal and preys on small birds. The park also has an aquarium and a snake house which has about 35 species of fish and 32 snakes belonging to five species respectively.
