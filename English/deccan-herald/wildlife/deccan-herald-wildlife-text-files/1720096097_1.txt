The recent discovery of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle underscores the significance of these bird counts and the valuable data they yield for conservation efforts,” said Kishor Rithe, Director, BNHS.“The White-bellied Sea-Eagles are commonly observed in inshore seas, islands, coastal regions, estuaries, and terrestrial wetlands. They nest in forested areas, woodlands, and rocky terrain, and there is a possibility that they are nesting in SGNP,” said Asif Khan from the BNHS Programmes Team. The BNHS, began monitoring the birds in SGNP and TWS  in  February 2021, through a citizen science programme called the “SGNP Bird Monitoring Programme or SGNP Bird Count” for short. Under this programme, BNHS conducts a Bird Count every month at various locations in SGNP and TWS.  The count takes place every month with the help of BNHS members, bird watchers and other volunteers.
