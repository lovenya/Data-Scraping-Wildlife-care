However, the department charges a different fee structure for citizens and foreigners, which causes a war of words between tourists and forest department staff.

Earlier, private resorts near Bandipur had been given permission to operate vehicles in the park. However, following complaints that resorts charge hefty fee, their licences were cancelled and the governmentâ€™s undertaking Jungle Lodge and Resorts was allowed to take travellers through the forest. But, tourists complain that Jungle Lodge is charging a huge fee in the name of packages.

Special vehicles needed
Many tourists opine that special vehicles suitable for taking photographs should be provided to Bandipur National Park. During holidays, there is a large influx of tourists, but many return without enjoying a drive in the forest due to the limited number of vehicles. 
Photographer Kiran Begur observes that many times none of the animals are visible. Instead of plying on the same old route, forest staff have to take tourists on new routes, he added.

During safari, tourists also have to maintain silence and refrain from shouting or disturbing animals. 

Forest officials should take stringent action against those who throw polythene bags in the forest.

Bandipur deputy conservator of forests Dr Hanumanthappa said there were sufficient vehicles in the forest. 

But, during holidays tourists influx increase. Adding more vehicles would increase maintenance cost during other days, he added.
