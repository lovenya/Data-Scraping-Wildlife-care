Assam's reputed wildlife filmmaker Gautam Saikia is participating in this year's edition of International Film Festival of India (IFFI) with a film that would be a hair-raising experience for the audience - a 25-feet-long Burmese rock python and its process of laying and hatching 87 eggs spread over 55 days.

Saikia has captured every moment of the reptile's reproduction running into hundreds and thousands of tapes and later framed it into a short film all of 23 minutes.

Saikia, who in past has made it to Indian Panorama section of IFFI, is now competing for the Short Film Centre's Environment award with his film 'Unseen Beauty, Unhidden Truth'.
"The film is shot in Manas region of Western Assam, which is veritably heaven of lush green forests that sustains an impressive variety of flora and fauna. Manas has everything. Mammals, birds and reptiles," Saikia said.The filmmaker had raised a make-shift shed next to the place where the python had laid the eggs."I shot every moment of the process. And later sat for editing," the filmmaker said.ADVERTISEMENT
