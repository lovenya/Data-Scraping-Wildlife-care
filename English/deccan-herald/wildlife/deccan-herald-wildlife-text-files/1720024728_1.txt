Many visit the region to have a glimpse of the Western Ghats. However, some activities of the tourists have been creating nuisance to the people of Chikmagalur. 

The tourists take liquor bottles, plastic bottles, glasses and eatables in plastic carry bags and leave it in the hillock. One can see heaps of plastic cary bags on the top of the hillock. People residing near the tourists spots off late have been annoyed by the nasty behaviour of the tourists. It is said that the tourists misbehave in public.  

Environmentalists said “the hillocks in Western Ghats are one of the hotspots of the world. The unique grasses in the region have been converted into dustbins by these tourists. Neither the district administration nor the tourist department has initiated any measure to check the behaviour of the tourists.” 

A team of four boys and a girl from Bangalore, who had come to Mullayanagiri on Friday, were seen smoking hookah in the middle of the road. However, they were caught red handed by the wildlife activists, who later paid a fine for their mistake, said public. 

There is a need to keep a track on those tourists who misbehave in the public. 

Before the moral police become active in the region, the district administration, police and the forest department should wake up and give a full stop to all such behaviours, said public.
