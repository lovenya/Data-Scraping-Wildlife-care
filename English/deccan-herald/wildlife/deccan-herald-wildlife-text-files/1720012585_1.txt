ADVERTISEMENTWipeout Australia premieres on April 14 at 10 pm on AXN. Remember the zany Japanese game shows of the 1980s?

This all-new game show puts a modern twist on the Japanese game show format, with a touch of Fear Factor gruesomeness. Each week, contestants go through obstacle courses in a bid to win the US$50,000 prize money. 

Imagine having to eat a disgustingly large lunch and other foods, Fear Factor style, before having to execute crazy stunts such as fighting with giant boxing gloves, or running on giant floating rubber balls. 

Wipeout... is designed to literally wipe out the contestants. Find out who will be the last man standing in this exciting reality TV series!
