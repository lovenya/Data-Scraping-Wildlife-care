Dissatisfied with the step, the opposition Congress has demanded transfer of the case to the CBI. The newly-appointed Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Bhopal, Yogesh Choudhry, however, said:  “We have constituted five teams to probe the murder”. 

Shehla was found shot dead inside her car, in front of her house, in the Koh-e-Fiza locality here, on Tuesday. She had gone on a fast recently, in support of Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption campaign. She was also involved in wildlife conservation campaigns and the issue of tigers deaths in the state sanctuaries.

Meanwhile, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh has demanded a CBI probe into the RTI activist’s death.  

“Shehla had been working for a long time as an RTI activist and many officials and politicians were affected by this,” he said in a letter to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday. The probe must cover the corrupt politicians and officials, affected by her work, he said.

The Congress leader further claimed that in January Shehla had written to the state home minister, saying she feared a threat to her life from a senior police official. But she was not provided any security, nor  was the said police officer questioned, Ajay alleged. 

Singh also said in the letter that he was amazed to read in the newspapers that Shehla’s death could be a suicide. 

The leader of Opposition pointed out that even the police had said that no weapon was found at the spot, which made the killing even more mysterious. The law and order situation in the state had collapsed totally, he charged.
