The petitioners, A N Karthik, P Manjunath and others, have moved the High Court stating that the island also known as ‘Pigeon Island’ is a proposed biodiversity heritage site with rich diversity of coral reefs and good diversity of flora and fauna. 

Rare birds

The island, situated nine nautical miles from Bhatkal and 19 km from Murudeshwar, according to the petitioners is home to rare birds like white bellied sea eagle and edible nest swiftlets. 

“This island gives shelter to species protected under Schedule One of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” said B R Deepak, counsel for the petitioners.

Citing a survey conducted by Karnataka Biodiversity Board in the early 2000s, the petitioners submitted that the survey team had found that the heart-shaped island was covered with hard coral (14.7 per cent), sponges (2.7 per cent), algae (63.2 per cent), boring polychaetes (13.3 per cent) and mussel (0.3 per cent).

“This is the first report of existence of small giant clams from the West coast of India.  The coral ecosystem is very rich here, so is the diversity of fish,” the petition said.
The survey report pointed out that Nethrani Island was used for target practice by the Indian Navy, and it was pretty obvious by the scars on the sides and the large white target marks on the rock faces. 

The petitioners said that despite several requests and pleas made to the defence minister, chief secretaries and even the Western Naval Command Head, the threat to the island continued. 

The division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Vikramjit Sen and Justice A S Bopanna adjourned the matter.
