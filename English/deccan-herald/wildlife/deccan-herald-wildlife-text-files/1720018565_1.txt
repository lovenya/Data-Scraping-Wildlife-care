That is sphagnum moss carpeting the banks of a bog that stretches across hundreds of acres, a signature feature of northern landscapes.

Those are tamaracks and black spruces – cold-tolerant conifer trees found mostly in Canada – rising from the shores. A pair of gray jays alights on a branch: they, too, are at the southern end of their range.

Jenkins, who is the author of the book ‘Climate Change in the Adirondacks: The Path to Sustainability,’ spends much of his time on the water and in the woods, documenting the ecosystem with a notebook and a camera. He thus brings an unusual perspective to the scene. Where a casual observer might behold diversity and continuity, he projects decades into the future and finds absence and loss.

Loss of ice likely
“Nothing we see here is found at temperatures 10 degrees warmer, and very little makes it to 5 degrees warmer,” Jenkins said matter-of-factly on a mild fall day. “We will be in a climate that this community has never known in its history. One has to go back to world climate levels we haven’t seen in 15 million years.”

Such warming is what scientists’ temperature models forecast if significant steps are not taken, and soon, to cut carbon emissions. The Adirondack Mountains, host to two Winter Olympics, could lose much of their ice and snow by the end of the century.

A rise of 10 degrees in temperature would put the six million-acre state park, a mix of public and private lands, in the same climate zone as the mountains of North Carolina and Georgia. So while Jenkins pursues his field studies and lectures, he also makes time to capture the present, taking some 30,000 photographs in recent years.

“Maybe it’s a baseline measurement, or maybe it’s an elegy,” Jenkins, 68, said of his photographic record of alpine flowers and mighty pines. “We may be the last generation to see the big bogs and the boreal creatures.”

A major study of the impact of climate change on New York State drew similar conclusions. In a 600-page report published last month, scientists from Cornell and Columbia Universities, as well as the City University of New York, said temperatures would rise as much as nine degrees by the 2080s. 

They also projected the decline and eventual loss of spruce-fir forests and alpine tundra in the Adirondacks.

Jenkins has yet to detect signs of stress in trees and plants, which respond slowly to alterations in temperature. Northern mammals like moose and pine martens are holding steady, though they, too, are sure to suffer. “They are both at their thermal limits here,” he said.

Evidence of warming
Yet there is ample evidence elsewhere that the region is already reacting to a warmer climate. “For the hunters, farmers, hikers and birders, the change in the climate, especially in the past 10 to 15 years, is just too great to write off,” he said.
Hard frosts that a generation ago came in mid-September now arrive in October. 

Lake Champlain, a huge freshwater body that divides New York and Vermont, once froze over completely every winter, but now remains open in the middle some years. Ornithologists have recorded recent declines in northern bird species like the black-backed woodpecker, olive-sided flycatcher and rusty blackbird. Loggers have told Jenkins that their winter operating season – the period when they haul timber over frozen earth – has been shortened by almost six weeks.

Until recently, Jenkins said, he thought climate change would have its initial impact on nature, and only later would it affect environments made by people. But then came Tropical Storm Irene in August.

 In the High Peaks region, up to 10 inches of rain sent boulders, trees and torrents of water down mountainsides, destroying roads and houses. That storm followed persistent flooding in the spring that devastated farms in the Champlain Valley. (Scientists say intense rainfalls are a hallmark of climate change.)

During his climate presentations, Jenkins tries to end on an upbeat note. He caps his alarming assessment – illustrated with charts and maps and landing like a punch to the solar plexus – with a prescription for personal change. His book on Adirondack climate, published last year by Cornell University Press, lays out strategies for residents, business owners and local officials.ADVERTISEMENT
