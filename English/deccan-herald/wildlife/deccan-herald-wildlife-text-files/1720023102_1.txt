Without development, there is no meaning for public contact programmes. The people will lose trust in public contact programmes,” he said.   “I have visited the Naxal infested areas and have understood the problems. I need the support of all the officials to solve the problems.” 

“Without waiting for the special package from the government, with the support of all the departments, we can create a model in the district. The police department has understood the problems in Naxal infested areas. It is not possible to find solution to Naxal menace through law and order alone. We need to understand the needs of the people,” he said.

“By providing infrastructure facilities, road, education, health and electricity, we can solve the Naxal menace in 12 villages. Measures should be taken to provide drinking water, doctor to treat the ills at Primary Health Centre and schools for educating the kids of the region. It is not possible to recruit ANMs on the basis of population in the region.

However, the villages should be considered as special and special emphasis should be taken to solve the problems.” 

The IGP said the support of the forest department and wildlife division are essential for the police department. 

He also spoke on the measures which can be taken up by the district administration in rehabilitation. 

Superintendent of Police Abhishek Goyal spoke on the survey conducted by the police department. 

Deputy Commissioner Dr N S Channappa Gowda directed various departments to respond to the woes of the people. The Information department should create awareness among the locals. 

The DC also directed the officials to start mobile health centre and mobile food distribution system in Naxal infested areas. 

Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Dr K N Vijayaprakash said that employment can be given to the villagers in Naxal infested areas through MGNREGS. Anganwadi centres will also be set up in the region. 

At the same time, health camps will be conducted and public contact programmes will be held regularly. 

The beneficiaries list will be identified and brought to the notice of the police department by July 15. Additional DC Dayanand, ASP P Anucheth, DCF Palaiah and others were present.
