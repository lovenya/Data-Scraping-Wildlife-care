At a press conference here, Avdhash Kaushal, chairman of the Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK), which takes up the cause of human rights violations, also asked the government to probe the corruption that had taken place in the name of rehabilitation of Van Gujjars in Pathari and Gaindi Khaita areas of Haridwar district.

“Till now, these Van Gujjars have not been given any ownership rights of the land where they were shifted,” Kaushal claimed. On the other hand, the forest department officials are harassing Gujjars, forcing them to leave the jungles. He also cited the report made by the then chief wildlife warden S K Chandola who had indicted former Rajaji Park director G S Pandey in the embezzlement of funds pertaining to the rehabilitation of Gujjars.

“The government is not taking any action on this report especially when it takes credit for bringing a stronger Lokayukta bill,” said Kaushal. He also threatened to launch a state-wide agitation if the government forcefully tries to uproot Gujjars from forests. He said various orders by the Lokayukta as well as the Central government had already made it clear that Gujjars would continue to live in forests.

A group of Gujjar leaders present there claimed that those who had been forcefully sent to Pathari and Gaindikhaita are living in poor conditions in the absence of basic amenities.ADVERTISEMENT
