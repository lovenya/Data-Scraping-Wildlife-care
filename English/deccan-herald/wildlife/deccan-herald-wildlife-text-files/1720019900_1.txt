Krishna Mishra, finance and administration head, Siddharth Travel informs, “For this month, our travel agency has received the maximum bookings for Jaipur and Agra.” 

He further adds, “There have been bookings for Amritsar too, mainly around Christmas and New Year.”

Then there are those who want to spend their weekend in the lap of nature. Jim Corbett National Park, situated in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand is also grabbing a lot tourists this season. “Lovers of wildlife wait every year for the Park to be re-opened in October, and throng the place till late December,” says Vibhas Prasad, managing director, Leisure Hotels Ltd. 

And true to the sentiment, Bhavdeep Kaur, general manager, Audi, is every bit excited about an upcoming trip to Corbett with her family. 

She remarks, “I visited Corbett once but without family and it was totally fun-filled with a little bit of adventure. So this time I am visiting there with my folks around the New Year.”

White water rafting is also not way behind with many weekenders planning to indulge in river rafting and camping at the banks of Ganges in Rishikesh. 

Vibhas adds, “Two-night/three-day tour packages that include rafting and camping at Rishikesh is also sought after during winters. In fact, we are already packed till April next year.” 

Ruma Sharma, assistant manager, Uday Tours and Travel Private Ltd, informs that Delhiites are moving away from regular hill stations like Shimla and Nainital and are open to trying out newer options this year. 

“While some people are sticking to conventional places to see snow during winter, others are planning to explore lesser crowded places like Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh,” says Ruma.

Ajay Malhotra, general manager of Microfinish Group of companies, for instance has chosen to visit the less-travelled Himalayan region of Garhwal with his group of friends during the first week of January. 

“I am planning to go there for a week, after the snow has settled down a bit,” sums up Ajay.
