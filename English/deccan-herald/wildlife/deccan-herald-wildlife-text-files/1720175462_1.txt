As the world is under lockdown to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, we are seeing reports of wild birds, animals roaming around in the cities. Though, it gives us a really good refreshing break from the depressing news, but also make us realise planet Earth can heal itself with or without humans.ADVERTISEMENTAlso, we often see fancy tweets and messages on the social media platforms on Earth Day or any special environmental celebration week, that we humans have to act fast before the Earth becomes inhabitable. But, the truth is nature doesn't need us, but it is the other way around. We need the nature, as the latter can survive on its own and if we, like dinosaurs go extinct, it won't be the end for the Earth, as there will be another superior species of animals, which will rise and take over, and the life cycle continues as usual.So, it is imperative for us humans to become conscious of the acts we do every day and try to make sure, while we consume any resources, it is not excessive and never waste. It's the only way to prolong the human species on Earth.As we mark the 50th anniversary of the Earth Day, we at DH are listing the top five iOS apps to help you develop a disciplined life and cut back on the carbon footprint.Ecosia (by Ecosia)
