Interestingly, Forest officials have roped in pig catchers to trace the ferocious feline.ADVERTISEMENTPig catchers from Rukmani Nagar in the city, armed with nets, are searching the factory premises. A big part of the factory flanks the Kakati forest range. The leopard was sighted by morning walkers, but the search operations began nearly six hours later.The leopard was caught on the CCTV camera installed by Syndicate Bank. The bank is located in the factory's residential colony. The bank staff called the jurisdictional Malmaruti police.Assistant Conservator of Forests S Sangolli said, leopards usually rest during the day and hunt at night. They hide in big trees. Forest officials decided to lay a trap. A cage is being brought by the Forest staff of Khanapur range. Meanwhile, the factory's colony residents, have been asked to stay indoors. Public announcements were made using speakers. Residents have been asked not the move about alone; but in groups. They have been told not to let children outside.
