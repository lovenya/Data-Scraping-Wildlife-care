Photography, mind you, is being taught at various mass communications institutes across the country. But this school is entirely devoted to photography and is the latest initiative of Bharati Vidyapeeth, which runs 78 schools  and 60 institutions for higher education in India.  

 Set up with the avowed aim and objective of creating world-class photographers, the School of Photography has Rajan Chaugule, a veteran photojournalist at its helm and as visiting faculty, leading photographers from across the country. Those sharing their experiences with students include Mukesh Parpiani, Atul Loke, and Sherwin Crasto. 

Chaughule, a leading photo-journalist with 25 years experience in the field, says  BVSP will impart, “quality education using the latest technology and state-of-the-art equipment to develop soft skills, techniques and a thorough understanding of the art of photography.” 

 The BVSP is offering a one-year diploma course where students will learn fundamental techniques, move to advanced photography and finally opt for an area of specialisation of their choice. The specialisation subjects include fashion, food, portrait, industrial, sports photography, among others.

The School is also offering six-month certificate courses in photojournalism, wildlife and travel, wedding, events, portraiture and fashion photography along with lighting and techniques.

Chaugule is proud of the School’s studios, digital lab, library stocked with books written by world famous photographers, leading photography magazines and a collection of educational videos to help students enhance their visual sense and develop concepts. There is also a Prop Shoppe with over 500 props! 

BVPS is the brainchild of Bharati Vidyapeeth’s Secretary, Vishwajeet Kadam, who says, “The courses are meticulously designed to ensure that students not only learn how to technically shoot good pictures, but also enhance their creative skills in order to develop their own individual style.”

The School will also offer short intensive digital photography courses and photography workshops, crafted to cater to all skill levels; from amateur to advanced photographers, covering a range of topics. Students will be encouraged to undertake creative projects which will be selected for exposure in the appropriate media. A ‘photographer of the month’ contest will also be held to encourage students. An annual exhibition of students’ work will be organised and industry constituents and allied audiences will be invited for viewing their work. Study tours will also be conducted as part of the curriculum.

The first semester kicks off on June 15, 2011. Says Chaugule, “The curriculum will not only strengthen their basics, but also enhance their creativity. This will help students shoot images in their own distinct style.” For further details, check out:
