The death of 45-year-old S Manikandan, Conservator of Forest, Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, has sent shock waves among conservationists and Forest department officials alike.ADVERTISEMENTManikandan joined the services on December 6, 2001. He had completed his MSc in Entomology. In 2008, he showed his worth as the deputy conservator of forests, territorial, in Bagalkot and in 2013, when he was posted as the conservator in Ballari. Forest officials credit him for controlling tourism in Nagarahole tiger reserve. Soon after he took charge in 2016-17, he controlled the movement of safari from Nagarahole to Nanchi and shifted the movement of safari from Nagarahole to Veeranahosahalli. This ensured that the pressure from safari is reduced and the reserve is better secured."On compassionate grounds, his wife will be given a job. For the first time a senior officer died in an elephant attack and compensation will be discussed and duly given," said Punati Sridhar, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and added that orders have been issued to probe the matter.Retd Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Avani Kumar Verma said such incidents show the danger forest officials face, but still they are not recognised for their services.Praveen Bhargav, Trustee, Wildlife First, said: "This is a tragic incident. One thing Manikandan did was shifting of tourism outside the Nagarahole park, which helps reduce disturbance inside the park."Elephant expert Ajai Desai said the staffs' attention was on the burnt area while the tusker stood still in the bushes. DB Kuppe is a good area for elephants now, because of water. It is also possible that the animal could have been in musth or got scared of the noise. It will be uncalled for if the elephant is captured.
