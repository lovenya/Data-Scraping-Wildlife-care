The flood situation in Assam remained serious with 57 more villages inundated on Tuesday, forcing people to leave their houses.

ADVERTISEMENTAccording to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the affected villages fell in three districts â€” Dhemaji, Chirang and Lakhimpur.

Nearly 1.05 lakh people have been affected so far after about 400 villages were submerged in 11 districts across the state.

The first wave of flood this season since June has claimed one human life in Morigaon district. An elephant and an antelope were also washed away in Nagaon district near Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat district. The flood has also affected Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and assured him of central help. As per ASDMA data, eight relief camps have come up in Dhemaji and Chirang districts with about 2,500 people sheltered there.

Heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh has caused river Jiadhol to rise and submerge fresh areas in worst-hit Dhemaji district.

Besides, 6,000 hectares of agricultural land have been submerged with standing crops like rice being destroyed. The Brahmaputra at Nematighat in Jorhat district was flowing above the danger level.
