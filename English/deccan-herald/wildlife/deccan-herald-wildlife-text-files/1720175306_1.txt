Animal lovers and wildlife experts were outraged by the killing of tigress T1, popularly known as Avni on Saturday. The tigress was shot dead by Ashgar Ali, the son of Hyderabad-based sharpshooter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan.ADVERTISEMENTThey don't know what they have done#RIP_AVNI pic.twitter.com/upFwQARHei— I Love Siliguri (@ILoveSiliguri) November 3, 2018Most of the users online were critical of the decision to kill the tigress that is believed to be responsible for the deaths of 13 people in Yavatmal district of Maharashtra. Avni is survived by her two 10-month-old cubs.RIP dear Avni... Please forgive us 🙏🙏😭😭 #avni @PetaIndia @peta @angie_karan @peta2 pic.twitter.com/XSuNMzIX2x— Mizrra ® (@suraj4sharma) November 3, 2018The state government had spent several lakhs and tried everything from thermal drones, perfumes, sniffer dogs, paraglider and camera traps to capture Avni but to no avail. One user claimed that we were laying the foundation for our own destruction by killing wild animals and destroying their habitats.We killed AVNI! We lay the foundation for our destruction! Rest in peace my beautiful country! RIP INDIA!@letavnilive @PMOIndia @narendramodi @SMungantiwar @drharshvardhan @Dev_Fadnavis @NTCAtiger @blackcatrescue pic.twitter.com/8vp7FGm9y6— Tanisha Kashyap (@KashyapTanisha) November 3, 2018One user alleged that the tigress had been eliminated to ensure that land could be allotted to certain corporate entities.With immense sadness I inform you that @SMungantiwar murdered #Avni in cold blood.

As always @Dev_Fadnavis made false promises.

Who cares for the life of tiger when Reliance and other such Man-eaters are on the prowl for forest land. #Murderers https://t.co/q5XoPqrGti— Preeti Sharma Menon (@PreetiSMenon) November 3, 2018Wildlife experts had called for attempts to tranquilise and capturing Avni rather than eliminating her.Sorry #Avni, you shouldn't have trusted our false promise of 'National Animal'. Rest in peace...#TigressAvni pic.twitter.com/XPHBBGRtyO— Mani Ram (@maniramk79) November 3, 2018Experts now worry about the safety and security of the cubs, who have still not been found. Some on social media pushed back against the outrage from environmentalists and others. They reminded people that this tiger may have been reponsible for 13 deaths.So for this so called environnentalists, life of one wild animal is more important than lives of 13 innocent people. Grow up #Avni— 🇮🇳 (@NaPeruLokesh) November 3, 2018@PreetiSMenon
