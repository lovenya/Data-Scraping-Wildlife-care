The meeting, conducted on August 23, is said to have discussed altering the government affidavit filed before the Central Empowerment Committee appointed by the apex court which is inquiring into the charges of building an illegal road through the sanctuary by felling trees.

Concerned over what they see as an attempt to whitewash the illegal act, some legislators and conservationists have complained to Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa against the Speaker, it is learnt.

The August 23 meeting, it is learnt, focussed on two major issues, one on withdrawing  affidavits filed by the State Forest Department before the Supreme Court appointed Central Empowerment Committee Road in connection with illegal road construction in Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary.  

In December 2008, Deccan Herald  reported about the building of the illegal road in Pushpagiri by people under the protection of some MLAs, who entered the forest illegally and felled many trees. Based on the Deccan Herald report, a petition was filed before the Supreme Court appointed CEC.

Sources said the August 23 meeting was attended by S V Ranganath, Chief Secretary, Meera Saxena Additional Chief Secretary, department of Environment and Forests, Secretary Forests,  Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Conservator of Forests Sudarshan and an IAS officer and others. 

“It did not have any agenda, neither the minutes of the meetings were recorded. But the agenda was that the officials were told to withdraw the affidavit filed by the Government before the CEC,” sources said. 

MLC, M C Nanaiah said: “ I have learnt that senior officers were forced to attend the meeting convened by the Speaker at 11 am on August 23, where Sudarshan was said to be dictating to correct the affidavit. This is a case of misuse of power and amounts to the interference with the matter which is subjudice before the Apex Court appointed CEC, “ he said.
