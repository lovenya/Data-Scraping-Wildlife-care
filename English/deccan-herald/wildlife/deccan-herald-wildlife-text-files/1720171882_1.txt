Their efforts are bearing fruits and the number of Irrwaddy dolphins, a highly endangered water species, has been increasing steadily in Orissa's Chilika lake, Asia's biggest brackish water lagoon. 

According to sources, the population of Irrwaddy dolphins is less than four figures worldover. Currently, Chilka Lake has 158 of these rare cetaceans, according to a recent census conducted in the lagoon by Chilika Development Authority (CDA), the government-run agency in charge of the world famous water body. 

The figure is significant as the total population of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Orissa Lake was only 89 when the first dolphin census was carried out in the lagoon in 2003. The number grew to 146 a year ago. "The population of these rare dolphins has gone up in the lake by nine per cent compared to last year. This rise is a good indicator of the health of the lake's ecosystem," claims  chief executive of CDA Ajit Patnaik. 

According to officials, the lake has already been acknowledged as a wetland of international importance and the steady growth of the dolphin population is a result of the steps initiated by the authority to arrest the untimely death of these shy mammals and allow them to grow in a peaceful and conducive atmosphere. 

When the officials realised that mechanised boats carrying tourists for dolphin sighting had turned out to be the killing machines for these highly sensitive water animals, they acted swiftly and took firm action. The mechanised boats can operate only in the outer channel of the lake where 70 per cent of the dolphins in the lagoon are sighted. 
Now, to reduce the sound of the engines, the authorities are working with the National Innovation Foundation, Ahmedabad, for introduction of mechanised boats with less noise. Now, the boats switch off the engine, some 75 m away from school of dolphins. Also, restrictions have been put in place on the number of boats at a time in the lake.
A few "dolphin watching regulations" designed with the assistance from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, have also been enforced in the lake. Wildlife officers regularly patrol the dolphin sighting areas and keep an eagle eye on the violators.

As fishing was resulting in the pre-mature dolphin deaths, the authorities have banned fishing in the outer during for two months from December every year. No net fishing is allowed in the area throughout the year. 
"Due to the above mitigation measures, the casualty rate of dolphins has been declining," said Patnaik.  

The CDA has already put in place a plan for further research on these endangered water species. A memorandum of understanding has already been signed with the Tokyo University for an acoustic survey by using "customised hydrophones", a new device developed by the international university which will provide vital clues on the under water movement and behaviour of these rare dolphins. Irrawaddy dolphins spend about 98 per cent of their time under water.

According to CDA officials, the equipment is ready for deployment and the process would begin after the coming monsoon.  "The underwater movement and behaviour data would help to develop the conservation strategy with more precision," Patnaik maintained. 
Irrawaddy dolphins are protected under the provisions of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Penalty for violation of these provisions include imprisonment for a period which shall not be less than three years and also a fine which shall not be less than Rs 10,000.
