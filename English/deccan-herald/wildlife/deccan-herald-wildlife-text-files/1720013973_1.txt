But holidaying in this country should not be limited to these places as there is more to Thailand than these spots. There is Chiang Mai, an emerging tourist haven located in northern Thailand. Having seen the vibrant Bangkok, I craved for something more laid-back. So, I set off to Chiang Mai to experience peace and tranquillity.

I land at the Chiang Mai airport, which is surrounded by mountains sheathed in green. Stepping outside the airport, I immediately feel that this place is different from many other bustling cities. Thailand’s second-largest city and the gateway to the country’s north, Chiang Mai is beautiful, serene and cool. It was early afternoon when I checked into a hotel. The facade of the hotel didn’t look very impressive, but once I stepped inside, I was mesmerised by its ambience.

Historic tales

My guide tells me that King Meng Rai founded the city and made it the capital of the Lanna (A Million Rice Fields) Kingdom in 1296, the same year when the Sukhothai kingdom was established. The moat that encircled the original city still runs through the city. Like every nook and corner of Thailand, Buddhists temples dot the landscape of Chiang Mai. Amongst the 300 temples, Wat Chiang Mun is the oldest one here. Other renowned temples are Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang, Wat San Fang and Wat Chai Mong Kol.

Thailand has always been identified with elephants too. Until 1916, the national flag consisted of a white elephant on a red background. Also, every year on March 13, the country celebrates National Elephant Day. Northern Thailand is home to various species of elephants living in dense jungles. Therefore, one fine crispy morning, we set out to the Mae Sa Elephant Camp situated in one of the lush forests in Chiang Mai. Here, elephants are engaged in various activities like playing football, basketball and are even seen gorging on a colossal all-you-can-eat buffet.

Initially, I was averse to taking a ride on this mammoth creature, but when I saw old ladies smiling while sitting atop these creatures, I gathered some courage and followed suit. 

Here, elephants are friendly but you need to learn their language in order to guide them. To turn right, you just have to tap the left side of the heavy animal with your leg and shout ‘right’. It is always a pleasure to spend time with these beautiful, tamed creatures. We watched in awe as one of the elephants got busy drawing pictures with a paint brush and he was indeed better than me at it!

Chiang Mai is a treasure trove when it comes to historical facts. Recently, archaeologists here found the remains of a lost city teeming with Buddhist shrines. Nearly 20 temple sites have been found in the area, which lies between the Ping river and the Lamphun highway. We set out on a tram to immerse ourselves in the hoary past and were hoping to get a glimpse of the nine main sites.

One can hire a horse-driven carriage or a bicycle to go around these sites. The ride takes you through a vast area where you can see the ruins. Another must-see is the Chiang Mai night safari. Under a dark, starlit sky, sitting in a tram with bated breath, we head out on a journey to see wildlife at night. We stop at several points to see Asian elephants,  white tigers, white rhinos, deers, hyenas, lions, wildebeests, yaks, giraffes, zebras and other animals. The ride which takes you through a 2.43 km loop is worth experiencing. It is a must-do for nature lovers. 

If you are looking for a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of city life, Chiang Mai offers stunning village haunts. You can find hordes of holidaymakers relaxing here in farms and rural spots, trying to rejuvenate themselves. Chiang Mai’s mountainous terrain makes the province a great destination for adventure sports like trekking, cycling, mountain biking, river rafting, cave exploration, and boat trips. One of the most popular trekking trails is the Doi Inthanon National Park where over 300 bird species and a wide variety of orchids and flowers can be seen. 

There is yet another thrilling adventure in store for tourists here — the Flight of the Gibbon — where you glide through the towering forests of Chiang Mai on a sling. The chance to soar above the tree cover is something you cannot miss. Like Thailand, Chiang Mai too has it own version of nightlife. Hotels and restaurants are plenty in number and experiencing this city and its culture, is an experience of a lifetime.
