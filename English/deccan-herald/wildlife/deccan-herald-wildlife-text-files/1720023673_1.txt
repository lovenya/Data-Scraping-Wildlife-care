As part of the service, each coach of the express train is fitted with two LCD screens. The aim of the service is to upgrade travel experience of passengers by offering real time information and entertainment in transit. “Since these coaches are fitted with GPS tracking system, information about the approaching station in the path of the train will also be available for passengers on board,” Muniyappa told reporters.

The infotainment facility will be extended soon to other trains including the Bangalore City – Chennai -  Bangalore City Lalbagh/Bangalore Express (12608/12609 ); Bangalore City – Chennai -  Bangalore City Bangalore /Lalbagh Express (12610/12607) and the Bangalore City – Hubli -  Bangalore City Jan Shatabdi Express (12079/12080). 

South Western Railway (SWR) has tied up with Tranz Vision Digital Media Private Limited for the “Go TV” infotainment service, to provide the facility.

SWR Divisional Railway Manager Sudhanshu Mani said for Shatabdi Express, a total of 20 customised 26-inch LCD screens were installed in the coaches, two in each coach. Apart from entertainment, the system would also deliver pre-recorded rail-related information, emergency alerts, arrival and departure time of trains, courtesy messages and social messages, he added. 

As per the contract, “Go TV” channel would have its broadcast schedule divided into slots of one hour each (15 minutes for rail-related information and 45 minutes slot for infotainment and advertisement distributed evenly). Content of infotainment is divided into categories such as kids, wildlife, yoga, health, comedy, celebrity interviews, movie clips, documentaries, infomercials etc. 

Speaking to Deccan Herald, “Go TV” Director Sunil Ravindranath said they are also planning to introduce news as part of the infotainment package on trains. “However, such a package won’t be real time information but “Go TV” server on each train will be loaded with news items with half an hour delay and the same is showcased during the transit,” he said.  The content will be a mixture of Kannada, Tamil, English and Hindi.
