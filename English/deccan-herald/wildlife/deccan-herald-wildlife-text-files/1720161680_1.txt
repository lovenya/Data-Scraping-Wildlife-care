Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said his government would go ahead with the proposed construction of two reservoirs at Mekedatu across River Cauvery and that the project would not harm Tamil Nadu’s interest in any way.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to reporters after garlanding the photograph of former prime minister Indira Gandhi on the occasion of her birth anniversary at the Vidhana Soudha, he said Karnataka will only be utilising its share of water as per the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal. So, there is no legal hurdle for implementing the project, he said.

The government intends to supply drinking water to nearby towns by constructing the reservoirs. Nobody can raise objection to utilising the State’s share of water, he said, indirectly referring to Tamil Nadu government’s plan to move the Supreme Court against the project.

‘No permission’

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Vinay Luthra said no proposal regarding the Mekedatu had come to them for clearance so far.

 “I have only read in newspapers and I am not aware of any court case pertaining to the project. We will not give any permission for any project in elephant and tiger habitats. In Cauvery and MM Hills, there are around 25 tigers. Let this file come to us and we will give our inputs to the Centre.” 

The proposed project falls in the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary.
