The Forest department told the NFR officials that the area was not frequented by elephants and there were such incidents in the past. They suspected that the elephants might have reached the area for crop raiding as this is the time for harvesting paddy. Death of Asian elephants, a schedule 1 (12B) wildlife species protected under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, in train hits has been a serious issue in Assam and parts of North Bengal as the railway tracks pass through hills and forest areas.The NFR said several measures have been initiated with the help of the forest department and local residents at several places in the past few years which prevented several similar mishaps involving wild elephants. Kaur said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. Check out latest videos from DH:
