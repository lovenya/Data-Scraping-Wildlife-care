This decision was taken at the fifth meeting of 45-member National Board of Wildlife, headed by the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, here on Thursday evening, sources told Deccan Herald.

The proposed department would have its own secretary and separate budget. 
One of its major tasks would be to relocate forest villages from the core areas of reserve parks and ensure that villagers get their adequate compensation.ADVERTISEMENT
