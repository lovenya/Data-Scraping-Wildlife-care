The continuing spell of drought has hit the coffee plantations in Lingadahalli hobli in the taluk. The coffee plants have withered due to lack of water. Lingadahalli hobli is surrounded by hillocks, which also provide the sources of water for the plantations.

ADVERTISEMENTThe estate owners have been lifting water from Hebbe and Kallathagiri waterfalls to irrigate the coffee estates. With the lack of pre-monsoon showers, every source of water has gone dry.

The groundwater table too has depleted. And, as a result, the coffee plants have withered.

“Even the wild animals from Tanigebailu Wildlife Division have been feeling the pinch of water shortage. The labourers who eke out a living by working at coffee estates are in distress without employment. The labourers who have come from Davangere, Haveri and other districts in search of employment are not finding jobs,” said Rajagiri Coffee Estate Manager Raghunath.

“It is sad to look at coffee plants, which have been nurtured since several years, wither away. We were hoping for good pre-monsoon rains. “The lack of rains will hit the coffee production,” said Selwin, Chief Manager of Maskal Maradi Coffee estate.
