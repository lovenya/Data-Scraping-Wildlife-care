There would be a special theme on the forts of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the legendary Maratha warrior."We want to keep people engaged and spread knowledge," Raghavan said, adding that e-courses on geology and genetics are also on the offing. "Right from the days of what the world would have been much before the dinosaurs came into what future holds, we have everything," said Dr Dalal.According to Raghavan,  the basic idea is to take the common public to these interesting subjects that majority does not talk about. "Public archaeology, public anthropology, public geology, public astronomy, public wildlife studies can bring in a change in how we look at things in the post-coronavirus scenario," added Raghavan.
