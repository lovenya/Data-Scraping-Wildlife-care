So it is very difficult to convince me for a role,” said Shweta.

However, the 31-year-old admits it was an instant decision to give a nod to Sony’s Parvarish, in which she plays a simple mother. “When I got the script and read it, I was ready to do the show. It is such a simple, true-to-life story, and I am sure this show will be a trendsetter for many such shows in future,” she said.

Shweta earlier featured in fiction shows like Jaane Kya Baat Hui and Naaginn as well as reality shows like Nach Baliye 2 and "Iss Jungle Se Mujhe Bachao". She even participated in ‘Bigg Boss 4’ and went on to become the first woman participant to win the show. The actress, who is also active in the Bhojpuri film industry, is also keeping herself busy on the movie front.

Recently, she sizzled in an item number Dil Ka Achar in Bollywood film Bin Bulaye Baraati and is set to feature in more films too. She says involving herself in different things keeps her creativity on the go. “This is called doing different characters. This is called working in this industry. If you keep doing the same thing again and again, then you feel like you are doing a nine-to-five job. I want to do different things. That’s why I took part in dancing reality shows, singing reality shows, comedy reality show and did Kasautii... and  Jaane Kya Baat Hui. I even played a negative role in Naaginn... and now I am playing this simple, non-glamourous mother in Parvarish,” said Shweta, who is raising an 11-year-old daughter Palak, single-handedly in real life. She says money is important, but not at the cost of the quality of her work. “I have tried everything in life. Yes, I am an actor, I want to earn money and want to have a 
particular budget coming home. But just to earn that money, I can’t keep doing the same thing again and again. I start getting frustrated and irritated soon. So I have to accept something which is close to my heart that I enjoy working in. That’s why I keep doing different things,” she said.

Among Shweta’s big screen projects is Indo-Pak movie Sultanat. She is also doing ‘Married To America’ and ‘Gopal My Bro’. In ‘Gopal My Bro’, she will feature alongside actor Karanvir Bohra, who played her son in Kasautii...Inside storyTLC presents ‘Piers Morgan On...’ on January 17 at 9 pm.
