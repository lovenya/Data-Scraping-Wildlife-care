Three days after the tragic death of 45-yeard-old elephant Ranga in Nagarahole forest, the Forest Department has decided to install CCTVs and regulate the speed of vehicles with help from the Kodagu district administration. ADVERTISEMENTRanga died after being hit by a private bus in Nagarahole National Park limits early on Monday.According to the officials, the CCTV cameras will be installed at the check posts of the department located along the 40-km stretch. Confirming the move, Deputy Conservator of Forests KT Hanumanthappa, also in-charge director of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, told DH that the system will be in place in a few days.“The CCTVs will record the vehicles and their registration numbers at the entry and exit of check posts all along the stretch. This helps us in ascertaining the nature of the vehicle and track their movement. Besides, we will also regulate the speed of the vehicles that will pass through the stretch in assistance with the deputy commissioner, Kodagu. The new system will be implemented in about two to three days,” Hanumanthappa explained.The forest department has already installed ‘Gastu’ (Patrol) software at the check posts which registers the entry and exit of vehicles. “Any vehicle passing through the stretch will be issued a ticket mentioning the entry time and registration number. The drivers have to show the ticket at the exit and the timings will be verified. If any discrepancy like early arrival or delay would only suggest that the driver was up to something inside the forest and they will be inquired. If they are found violating rules, they will be fined as well,” a senior official said.
