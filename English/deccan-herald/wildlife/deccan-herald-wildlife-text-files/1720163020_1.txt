BNP has no buffer zone

ADVERTISEMENTThe place where a wild tiger was sighted inside Bannerghatta Biological Park is just 40 kms from City centre. The spot abuts Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), the closest national park to a cosmopolitan City. 

BNP and BBP share the same boundary and the BBP (zoo and safari area) has been carved out of BNP. The forest patch and its boundary have been in focus for a long time because of the absence of buffer zone and man-elephant conflict. 
The presence of tiger has added to the concerns.

According to the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Wildlife Protection Society of India, at least a five a kilometre buffer zone should be maintained between national parks and human habitation. But that is lacking in case of BNP.

Sightings

A forest department official on condition of anonymity said: “Though there were sightings and evidence of presence of tigers inside BNP, we were keeping quite because we did not want to hit the panic button. News has spread after direct sighting. 

“We have been struggling for many years to protect the existing 270-sq km forest patch free from encroachment. We also deal with farmers who bring the cattle inside for grazing and those who suffer crop damage because of elephants straying outside the forest patch. 

“Due to political pressure and lack of cooperation from other government departments, such as Public Works Department and Revenue Department, we are not able to create a buffer zone.”

But now, lack of buffer zone has raised questions  about the safety of tiger and human population. A lot of high-rise apartments, offices, resorts and educational institutions have come up around the BNP. The officials maintained that the government should now act seriously towards creating a buffer zone as Karnataka has the highest tiger population in India.
