Major Industries Minister R V Deshpande has said the State government will not compromise on protecting the environment while constructing the Hubballi-Ankola railway line. 

ADVERTISEMENTIn a statement on Monday, the minister, while welcoming the decision of the National Green Tribunal for the Railways to go ahead with the Hubballi-Ankola railway line work, said, “Everbody should co-operate in implementing this project.”

The railway line will help improve comprehensive development of Uttara Kannada district besides North Karnataka. 

The chief secretary will convene a meeting of officials to give the final touches to the project and submit it to the Railways, he added.

The Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC) last year had disapproved the 168-km rail link project, primarily to transport iron ore from Ballari-Hosapete mines. 

The panel had said that the link would have “huge and irreperable”ecological impact on the forests, wildlife and biodiversity of the Western Ghats.
