The most captivating place in this picturesque town is the Ward Lake.ADVERTISEMENT The periphery of the lake is surrounded by pineapple trees, betel plantations which offer breathtaking views. Adjacent to the lake, is a botanical garden and a museum which I visited. 

The botanical garden has rare species of plants and trees along with well laid out gardens and the mini zoo of Lady Hydari. 

The next morning, with great enthusiasm, I decided to climb the Shillong Peak, a summit which offers a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. It is situated 10 kms away from the town. 

This part of the mountain trail in Shillong is a paradise for bird watchers as one can get a chance to see species like tree pies and whistling thrushes. After exploring the mountain, exhausted, I returned to my resort tired but satisfied.

There are several waterfalls in and around Shillong. First on my list was the Eagle and Elephant Falls. The falls were really wild and inviting. The thunder was audible, but the drizzle, suddenness and newness of the place bewildered me as I ran in the direction of the waterfalls. Â It was beauty personified, fortified by abundant rain. Other waterfalls in Shillong include Margaret, Sweet, Bishop and Beadon, which are worth visiting too.The best season to visit Shillong is during the months of October to March. The sky remains clear and the air is crispy and healthy. Especially during late March, the rhododendrons and magnolias are in bloom and the hillsides are covered with red, yellow, pink and white blooms. 

An interesting sight is watching the cars at night, lit up like pinpricks on a distant Shillong hillside, their lights moving slowly against the black background. 

As for the the architecture of Shillong, it is simple yet endearingly eloquent. The houses and cottages are built in simple English style with wooded roofs, cool verandas and tall pine trees in the backyard. Evenings can be spent at the centrally located bazaar. Observing the inhabitants and looking into shops is an engaging experience. 

The tribals clad in colourful and traditional attire sell attractive hand-woven shawls, bamboo work items, hand-woven bed spreads, saris, wrap around skirts and butterflies compressed in glass.

Excursions from Shillong lead to the Umian lake (16 kms) which is ideal for fishing, and Cherrapunji (54 kms). I was very keen to visit Cherrapunji. 

Just an hour drive from Shillong, I reached this town which has several waterfalls, shiny green ravines, gorges and mysterious caves. It has also rich in wildlife, which includes wild deer, gray panthers and leopards. 

While returning to the resort in Shillong, images of these eastern hill resorts will surely haunt me forever.
