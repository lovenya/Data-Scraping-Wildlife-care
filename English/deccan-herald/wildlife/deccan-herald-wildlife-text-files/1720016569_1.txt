In Asia, food assumes an almost mystical place in the cultural hierarchy so Culinary Asia looks East to this hotbed of nutritional innovation and diversity. Koreans see food essentially as a medicine to nourish and balance the body and attempt to present both yin and yang in the dishes they serve. 

In Japan, the principle of Kodawari, obsessive and passionate perfectionism, is often practised by sushi chefs with only the most experienced allowed to handle the finest cuts of tuna. 

Destinations such as India and Thailand have exerted a massive influence on world’s cuisine by absorbing and then reinventing dishes brought into their country by foreigners. Anyone fascinated by food will find this intelligent and thought-provoking series to be exactly to their taste. Watch Culinary Asia on February 21 at 8 pm on Discovery Channel.
