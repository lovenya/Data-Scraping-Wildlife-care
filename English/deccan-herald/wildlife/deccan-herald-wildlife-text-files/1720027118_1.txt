A two-and-a-half-year-old bison, Gowri, died at the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) due to suspected malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) here on Wednesday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe animal was suffering from anorexia, severe diarrhoea and high temperature for the past two days.  

“We are suspecting malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), which is a self-emitting viral fever. 

Visceral samples of the bison were collected during post mortem and will be sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune to analyse the virus strain,” Dr Chittiappa, the wildlife vet, BBP, said. 

BBP is left with eight bisons in the safari which are being used for conservation and recreation at the Park.
