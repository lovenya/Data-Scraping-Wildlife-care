Environment-friendly lifestyle is necessary for maintaining a good health. Several wildlife species are already on the verge of extinction following the interference of human beings in the nature and its components, said Mangalore University Biology Department Assistant Professor Dr Prashanth Naik.

ADVERTISEMENTHe was delivering a talk on environment protection and environment-friendly lifestyle for healthy life organised by the Natural History Association of the Applied Zoology Department of Mangalore University as a part of quiz, photography and talk programme. 

Explaining various problems faced by human beings due to the exploitation of nature, he said environment pollution has also affected the health of an individual. International studies have cited environment pollution as the main reason for the increase in global temperature and frequent change in weather. 

The problems like drought, flood, diseases like cancer and breathlessness are said to be due to environment pollution. The life of people will be worse in the days to come, if we continues to exploit the nature, said Dr Prashanth Naik. Emphasising on the responsibility of every individual to protect the environment and its components, he said people should not escape from their responsibility of conserving environment by considering it as the sole responsibility of the government, organisations, industrialists and capitalists. Responsibility lies on the shoulders of every individual to involve in environment protection personally or by indulging in mass activities. Natural resources can be preserved if people adopt the environment-friendly life style, he said. Photography contest was conducted for the Department students.
