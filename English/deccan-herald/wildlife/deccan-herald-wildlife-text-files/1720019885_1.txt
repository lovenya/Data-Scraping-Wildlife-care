The survey team is headed by Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) Director General Dr V K Bahuguna.

Speaking to reporters here, Bahuguna said they visited Gonda Reserve Forest and Vyasanakere in Hospet taluk today and found most mining areas did not have the required 7.5 metre safety zone outside the mining area for afforestation. All owners were warned their mines would be closed if they violated the laws.

The team plans a detailed survey of the impact of mining on the lives of people in the villages, with emphasis on Agriculture and Horticulture production, ponds, the ground water table, health and socio-economic conditions.

On Aug 5, the Supreme Court while allowing state enterprise NMDC to operate its two mines for producing iron ore in the district, had directed ICFRE to undertake a macro-level environment impact assessment jointly with Wildlife Institute of India,Forest Survey of India and other expert organisations in forestry as decided by ICFRE in consultation with the Environment and Forest Ministry.
