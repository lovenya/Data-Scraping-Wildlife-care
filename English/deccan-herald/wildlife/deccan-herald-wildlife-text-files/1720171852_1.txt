Former MLA and Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha chief Vatal Nagaraj on Tuesday barged into the closed-door meeting of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu officials and demanded that the night traffic ban on NH-212 and NH-67 passing through Bandipur Tiger Reserve should continue.ADVERTISEMENT"It is a lobby of the timber mafia, poachers and Kerala government who want to damage the forests and wildlife of Karnataka. So, they are demanding that the ban be lifted. We will not allow it to happen. If this happens, then we will stage a rasta roko in Bandipur Tiger Reserve. Karnataka should not budge and we the people of Karnataka are with the government," he told reporters after meeting the officials.All forest department officials who visited the head office were greeted by silent protesters who were carrying placards demanding that the night traffic ban stays. Around 50 men and women from various walks of life had gathered to support the night traffic ban.Mallikarjun G N, 65-year-old retired banker has been coordinating with Forest department officials during weekends to control vehicle movement in Bandipur. "Despite the ban, traffic is very high during weekends. One can just imagine if the ban is lifted. Department is already short-staffed and it is not their job to regulate traffic," he said.Ayappa K C, member, Coorg Wildlife Society, said that if there is forest fire during night, the reaction time will be less. So, night traffic ban is a good idea.Sharath G, volunteer of Vanya, an NGO, said as in Nagarhole, there should be a complete ban on vehicle movement inside Bandipur also. People of Karnataka will support the department and the government on this stand. There is a good alternative road for people to use, he added.
