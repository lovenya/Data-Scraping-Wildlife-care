In the last two days, villagers have complained of loud noise coming from Aman-i-Khas, the resort in Sawai Madhopur district where the couple and their friends are staying.
Concerned by the loud playing of songs and dances, the administration has decided top keep a watch on it.

"We have formed a committee which has members from police, forest department, administration and pollution control board to see that the wedding party in no way creates noise or environmental pollution," a district official told IANS.

"Loud noise can be harmful for wildlife. We have asked the guests attending the party to follow rules, failing which action can be taken against them," said the official.

Russell and Katy are expected to get married here over the weekend in Aman-i-Khas resort situated very close to the national park, which is one of the best places to see tigersADVERTISEMENT
