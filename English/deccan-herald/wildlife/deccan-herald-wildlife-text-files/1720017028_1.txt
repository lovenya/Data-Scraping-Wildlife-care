During the meeting of National Board of wildlife (NBW) in the last month, Dr Asad R Rahmani, director, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and member raised the issue based on the materials furnished by the Bellary-based wildlife enthusiast K S Abdul Samad. 

Dr Rahmani said steel plant planned by Bhushan Steel Industries in the vicinity of the Daroji Bear sanctuary would cause significant adverse impact on the Asiaâ€™s only bear sanctuary.

He said the bear sanctuary situated close to the world heritage site of Hampi near Hospet was only one of its kinds in India focusing on the protection of an endangered schedule-1 species. He urged that urgent action needs to be taken for mitigation.

Jairam Ramesh who is also the Chairman of NBW said that he would write to the Chief Minister on the issue.

State Board

Meanwhile, a team headed by Anil Kumble, Vice Chairman of State Board of wildlife (SBW) will also visit the spot next week to study the impact on the sanctuary.ADVERTISEMENT
