The Forest department, which had temporarily stalled ‘Operation tiger’ on Thursday after the operation went awry when a double barrel gun accidentally went off killing a person, resumed it on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENTDasara jumbos Abhimanyu and Krishna were used for the combing operation near Magge and Malali villages under the limits of Nagarahole Wildlife Sanctuary in the taluk.

Members of the public however, did not take part in the search following the death of Murthy (25), who died after forest guards accidentally fired a double barrel gun when they were trying to drive the wild cats into the forest.

The guards had burst crackers to chase the wild cats into the forest. The cubs fled from the farm in fear but hid in a bush nearby and reportedly sprang on the forest guards who accidentally fired the gun killing Murthy while injuring another bystander Kenchaiah and Range Forest Officer Mahesh.

More than 100 forest department employees, veterinarian Uma Shankar, sharp shooters Karumabiah and Venkatesh began the combing operation on Friday morning by dividing themselves into four teams. The operation was stopped in the evening as the tiger and its cubs could not be spotted.

ACF Belliappa told DH that the department has taken all precautions to continue the search operation of wild cats. Police personnel have also been deployed in large numbers as a precautionary measure.

APCCF Rangarajan, CF Manikantan, RFO Vinay of D B Kuppe Wildlife range, SP Ravi D Channanavar and others were accompanying and monitoring the operation, he said.

Forest department had begun the operation following complaints by the residents of Magge and Malali villages that a tigress and its two cubs were spotted frequently in the villages.

MLA S Chikkamadu visited the house of the deceased and presented a cheque for Rs 5 lakh given by the Forest department.
