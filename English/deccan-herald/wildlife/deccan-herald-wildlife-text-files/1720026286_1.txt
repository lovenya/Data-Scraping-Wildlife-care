For the first time in 15 years, a scientific bird census is being carried out by the Forest department at the Biligiriranganathaswamy (BRT) Hills tiger reserve in Chamarajanagar district. 

ADVERTISEMENTExperts and ornithologists from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are part of the census team. Ornithologists and forest guards from Dharwad, Bellary, Belgaum and Bangalore are also in the team.

The team members were lucky enough to spot rare birds in the tiger reserve on the first day of the census on Saturday. The team members came across yellow-throated bulbul, black-headed oriole, malabar parakeet, white-cheeked barbet, plum-headed parakeet, blue-headed rock thresh, etc. 

All the zones which come under the tiger reserve have been marked with 22 transect lines, which are each 3-km-long. 

As many as 11 teams have been formed to carry out the census. Boodipadaga, Jodigere, Honnameti, Muvatturu, Manjigere, Burade, Chinnare, Gundal, Kurimande, Biligirirangana Betta, K Gudi are being covered as part of the census.

Speaking with mediapersons, State Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Deepak Sharma said: “The bird census is being carried out for the first time in South India at the BRT. The Forest department has decided to conduct bird census in all the tiger reserves in the State and preparations for the same are on,” he said.

He further said: “The Forest department had not issued the ‘no-objection certificate’ to run the Gorukana Resort at the BR Hills. A report has been submitted to the government that the resort is being run on the land belonging to the Revenue department. The department concerned should take measures to evict the resort,” he added.

Later on, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests B J Hosmath, BRT Tiger Project Forest Conservator and Director Vijay Mohanraj inspected the areas being covered under the census. The census will continue on Sunday.
