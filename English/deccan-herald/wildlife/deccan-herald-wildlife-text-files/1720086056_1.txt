A lioness and four blackbucks were found dead near a dam at Visavadar in Gir forest division of Gujarat's Junagadh district, an official said on Saturday. These wild animals apparently died due to drowning, and there does not seem to be any connection with cyclone Tauktae, which ravaged the state earlier this week, he said.ADVERTISEMENT"The carcasses were found on the banks of a dam in Vekariya village of Visavadar range forest in Gir West forest division on Friday, and the cause of the death is being ascertained," chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Junagadh, Dushyant Vasavada said. Gir forest in Junagadh, one of the worst cyclone-affected districts in Gujarat, has a sizable population of Asiatic lions.Also Read | IAS officer clarifies on 'fake video' of Gir lions"The lioness, aged around five to nine years old, appears to have died due to drowning.
