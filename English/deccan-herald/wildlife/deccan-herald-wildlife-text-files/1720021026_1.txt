Five armymen have been booked and question in connection with the incident.
The remains of the chinkaras (Indian gazelle) and the uncooked meat was recovered from the camp of 88 Armoured Workshop, which is there to take part in the Operation Sudershan Shakti being conducted by the Bhopal-based 21 Strike Corps.

"Following a tip off, we went to the camp at Neemla area near Sheo Tehsil in the district and recovered three heads and uncooked meat. An army gypsy was also seized at the spot", Deputy Conservator of Forest in Barmer district B R Bhadu told PTI.

He said the chinkaras were apparently brought in the Service vehicle and that is why it was seized.

Chinkara is included in the endangered species list of India and hunting of these animals is banned.

Bhadu said a case was registered under sections 9 to 51 of Wildlife Protection Act-1972. Punishment for offences under these sections carry a maximum punishment of seven year jail term.

Meanwhile, Army Spokesperson Colonel S D Goswamy said a COI has been ordered into the issue and if anyone is found guilty, strict action will be taken against them.ADVERTISEMENT
