Bastion of the Giants, a documentary on the picturesque, bio-diverse wetland wildlife habitats of North Eastern India, will be screened at different venues across the city from October 30 to November 5.

ADVERTISEMENTThe habitats are by the river Brahmaputra and its tributaries and support a tremendous wealth of flora and fauna, among them the Asian Elephant. 

The film is essentially based in Kaziranga. While focusing on the lives of Asian Elephants, the film takes a more holistic view of conservation as elephants are seen in relation to the forests they live in.

Sumesh Lekhi, the writer, director and producer of the film, is a chartered accountant by education and beyond his business, also does some conservation work on the wetlands and mangroves, especially in the Oshiwara-Versova area of Mumbai. 

On Sunday, the film will come alive at the Rangoli Metro Art Centre on M G Road at 6.15 pm. The second screening will be at 6.15 pm on November 2 at GM Rejoyz, Malleswaram. 

On November 4, a screening is scheduled at the Suchitra Film Society at 6.15 pm. The final screening will be on November 5 at Renukamba Studio, Malleswaram from 4.30 pm to 8 pm.
