The  topography of our state is an interesting combination of the plains, forested mountains and granite hills. The granite hills, said to be older than the Himalayas, are both numerous and  well spread. And most of them were chosen for their sheer altitude and inaccessibility by the erstwhile kings and rulers to build formidable forts to live in peace from invasions.

The kings have come and gone. But the forts and fortresses remain, albeit  ruining and crumbling. The Jamalabad hill fort in Dakshina Kannada district is  one of them. 

Situated close to the sleepy town of  Belthangady, the Jamalabad hill, though part of the Kudremukh mountain range, stands alone like an inselberg. The steep drops on all its sides with an even plateau at the top  not only give it an incredible appearance but also made it a suitable  place to build a fort.

A fort was in existence  here in the  bygone days though it is not known who built it. Abandoned for a long time it was in a shambles. 

When Tipu built a new fort...
It was not until 1794 that Tipu Sultan came here and built a fort on whatever remained of the earlier one. And the name was changed to Jamalabad as he dedicated it to his mother, Jamalbee. Tipu kept the fortress in his possession for the next five years till the British annexed it in 1799. Though a chieftain by name Thimmanayaka held the fort for a brief  span, its possession was subsequently regained by the British. 

Presently the key features of the fortress have bitten the dust except for  a lone cannon, a magazine house at the top and a couple of bastions that still stand there defying time and elements.

Getting off a moffusil bus at the village of Nada, seven kms north of Belthangady, I began my approach to this hill from the north. Crossing a thin stream on the way while admiring its awesome look I passed through  the stone entrance arches to reach the base of the hill. Its location within the limits of the Kudremukh national park makes it mandatory to follow the entry rules as in any national park.  

The initial path goes up a smooth gradient with wide stone steps. The initiative of the forest department to create an  awareness of wild life with placards that talk of wildlife along the way is appreciable. The paragola serves as a place for rest and interaction. 
Once you get to the rocky slopes  the path  steepens  with uneven steps, close to 2000, making it hard to climb. The route is exposed until a  shady ledge is reached higher up. It is a place to rest and take in the views of the surroundings. The last stretch which  is the crucial aspect of the climb is so steep that the path is protected  with a wall right upto the top. 

A rusting cannon, circular bastions
On the way  is an old rusting cannon lying on the ground. A couple of circular bastions built with large stones are all that remain of the fort. The top of this 1788-ft high  hill is a  plateau with a profuse growth of the tall elephant grass.  There used to be two ponds here but only one of them holds water  though not potable. 

The southern summit has an old structure believed to be the place to store arms. The Tipu drop here, from where the guilty were pushed down the precipice, reminded me of the one back in Nandi Hills.

The summit affords  superb views of the vast plains immediately below and the distant chain of hills. The Kudremukh peak and its ranges in the north are a real treat to watch. As camping at the top is  not allowed these days  I reluctantly  retraced my steps back before dusk.
