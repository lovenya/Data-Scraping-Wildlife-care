Travel freaks in the City wait for summer to head out into the wild as well. Most save up just for their travel. 

Metrolife spoke to a few young people who travel out of the City to their favourite destinations across the country whenever they can afford to take off.   Goa, Kochi, Pondicherry, Coorg, Munnar, Meghamalai, Kodaikanal, Ooty and Chikmagalur are popular holiday spots. The coasts, ghats and beaches... excite them. Short trek is another something that the young indulge in. They venture out in bunches of six or seven, depending on the location. 

Suhas PremKumar, an IT professional, is keen on doing his bit for wildlife conservation. Travelling and photography are a passion for him. “I usually take off to the Western Ghats, Wayanad being a favourite spot. I take pictures of rare species of snakes and post them on Facebook to spread the word on conservation. I combine travelling and conservation,” said Suhas and added, “it’s the forests that I head to the most.”  ADVERTISEMENTJohn Irshad, an employee with a telecom company is a Royal Enfield rider who prefers to travel on his bike. He said that he has travelled on his bike to Darjeeling, Ladakh, Kolkata and Kanyakumari. “We usually venture out in a big group. Safety is high on cards and I travel with a tent, riding gloves and water proof jackets. We eat along the highway. It’s a memorable experience,” said John who takes off on his bike almost every weekend.  Shashank Reba, a student of St Joseph’s College prefers to trail along the coast of Mangalore, Goa and Kerala. “There’s something mysterious about the coast. It’s open and doesn’t leave you claustrophobic. I travel out once a year and save up for it as well. It’s refreshing and helps you focus better,” he said.   The Youth Hostel Association of India organises various adventure trips every year. They register not less than 600 people from South India and Bangalore contributes the most to the number. Prem Kumar, president of the Mysore Gangotri Unit said, “We organise two trips to the Himalayas — in  May-June and December. Road trips and other adventure sports are an integral part of the plan. People usually travel in groups of six or seven. They are accompanied by trained and experienced staff members.” Mullainagiri, Kemmanagundi, Thadiyandamol, one of the highest peaks in Coorg are among the favourite travel destinations of people from the City. “Habitual trekkers revisit the same places and they never get bored. It’s a new experience each time,” he added.
