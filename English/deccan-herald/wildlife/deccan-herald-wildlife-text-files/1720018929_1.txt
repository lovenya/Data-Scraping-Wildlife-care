The finding by a team of wildlife experts from WWF-India is a new addition to the rich mammal diversity of the country. The species is closely related to rabbits and hares.

Discovered in West Kameng district, in western Arunachal, the black pika is a small mammal with rounded ears, short limbs, and black fur. It is one of the newest species of pika, known to humans, as it was discovered in Pianma in the Yunnan province of China in 2000.

Also known as mouse hares, pikas are Himalayan dwelling lagomorphs (meaning hare-shaped). Though India has seven pika species, with the discovery of the black pika, the number of pikas found in the country has gone up to eight.

“This species can be distinguished from all other pika species found in India from its characteristic overall black coat colour,” said Aishwarya Maheshwari, Senior Project Officer, WWF-India, one of the members, who sighted the mammal. 

Like many of the smaller high altitude mammals, pikas are considered “Allogenic” engineers, for  the burrows which they construct to live are used by other species such as birds, reptiles and other smaller mammals. In addition, pikas play a key role as prey to various high altitude predators like birds of prey as well as small and large carnivores.

Maheshwari adds: “This pika resembles the one discovered in China but it urgently needs genetic confirmation to know if it is the same or a new subspecies.”ADVERTISEMENT
