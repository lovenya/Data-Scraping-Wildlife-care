Giving a platform to young and budding photographers, All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society (AIFACS) organised the 10th All India Photo Exhibition where photographers showcased their finest shots.

ADVERTISEMENTAimed to emphasise the excellence of photography as a medium of creative expression, the exhibition-cum-competition, which kickstarted on January 22, had on display some of the brilliant pictures taken by ace photographers across the country. And each photographer put up only five of his best shots either in black and white or colour on matt paper. 

The strongest visual power of the present times, photography in the 21st century has taken a big stride to create and capture some fantastic moments with stunning  effects. From the picturesque locations of Leh and Ladakh to celebrating Holi in Varanasi, from the amazing pictures of wildlife to profiles of people – the exhibition had everything under one roof. One can see that the photographers have taken that extra effort to capture the moments and shoot subjects of their choice. 

The subjects in the photographs are more or less part of our daily lives which we ignore or don’t care to study, like streets, animals, flora and fauna, religions, celebrations, etc. This year the Society received 638 entries from all over the country, out of which 221 entries by 68 participants were selected. 

Enthused by the overwhelming response, the president of the Society, Ram V Sutar said he is “really delighted to see such a big range of photographs taken by these photographers from all over India. This medium has taken a wider space in our society and many young photographers are showing their creative side through these 
brilliants shots.”

The exhibition-cum-competition is also a great way to enter the professional world of photography. The Society will give three AIFACS cash awards of Rs 15, 000 each to the outstanding portfolios with a minimum of three photographs. The exhibition is on till January 31.
