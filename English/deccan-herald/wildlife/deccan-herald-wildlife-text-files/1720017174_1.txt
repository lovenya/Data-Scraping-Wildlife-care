ADVERTISEMENTThe furniture and toys made out of lantana by the Soligas in the region find a place in the homes of people in Bangalore and Mysore.

Not many are however aware that the twigs and branches of lantana can be used for furniture. Typically, it is used for fencing in most parts of the country and State. It is also used as an ornamental shrub. The colourful flowers and fruits that this shrub bears draw a lot of butterflies to it.

The shrub lantana is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae, and is is called Jujakki or Roja by the local Soligas. But much like parthenium, this shrub grows quickly and occupies a lot of space. The Forest Department is often faced with the difficult task of clearing this.

Meanwhile, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE), which has been working for the welfare of the Soligas, has started to utilise this very shrub to cater to the employment needs of people in the region. As may as 50 families in Anevala, Konanakere, Palar and Ponnachi are using this weed to make toys and pieces of furniture.

This has ensured that they earn anywhere in the range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000 per month. According to Narayan, who has been striving to create awareness about the shrub which has actually posed problems to wildlife and other flora in the forests, using this for other purposes might actually help in its elimination eventually.

Lantana products have a market in Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka. Exhibitions of lantana products have been held in Mysore and Chamarajanagar on certain occasions in the past. The products made out of this are also not priced very high. Tribals from the region are provided a three-month training every year. ATREE provides fee raw materials for making products out of lantana as part of this project.
