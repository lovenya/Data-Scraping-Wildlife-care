The Tourism Department is keen on improving facilities at Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) and at Jungle Lodges and Resorts (JLR) to increase the footfall. 

ADVERTISEMENTTourism Minister Priyank Kharge told DH that the department was chalking out plans to improve the park, which attracts a lot of visitors. Among the priorities is to improve the approach road to Bannerghatta. The road is narrow and needs to be widened, he said. 

“Talks are also on to construct a digital amphitheatre in the zoo area. I have spoken to the zoo and JLR officials to improve facilities and speed up implementation of the zoo master plan,” he said. 

He said Bannerghatta is close to the city and is an ideal place for tourists to enjoy nature. JLR is a niche property and the department wants to promote more eco-tourism and wildlife tourism here. Though JLR can accommodate around 65 to 70 people, the footfall is not very high. There is also a need to make the place more accessible to tourists, especially foreigners. Bannerghatta is a popular zoo and has the potential to attract more people, he said. 

BBP executive director Santosh Kumar said the amphitheatre is being planned near the Hill View Restaurant beyond the zebra enclosure on the open space belonging to JLR. 
At present, there is an auditorium located beyond the hippopotamus enclosure in BBP where short films are screened. 

He said the zoo was working according to its master plan on increasing the number of enclosures and getting more animals. 

Talks are on with zoos abroad to bring in more animals, including cheetahs and white lions from South Africa. The footfall last year at BBP was 12 lakh. The park attracts around 3,000 visitors during weekdays and between 7,000 and 10,000 on weekends and holidays.
