Actor John Abraham would be playing a 'tapori' in his upcoming film 'Welcome Back' and the role has been loosely modelled on superstar Aamir Khan's popular character in 1995 blockbuster 'Rangeela'.

"It is a completely different film and role, but the template is Aamir Khan in 'Rangeela'. But it is still very different. It is going to be a lot of fun. People will be shocked to see me in this role and I hope to shock them positively," John said at an event today.

Actors Nana Patekar and Anil Kapoor will reprise their roles of Uday Shankar Shetty and Majnu Bhai respectively from the previous film. John and actress Shruti Hassan are the new additions in Anees Bazmee's 2007 directorial venture.

John is also working on an intense yet commercial film on motorcycling.

"I am working on a script on motorcycling, it will take a year to develop. I want to make the most intense, serious motorcycling film that India has ever seen. It will not be caricaturist. But it will be a commercial film for all motorcycling fans and people who are interested in that," said the 40-year-old actor, who is a bike enthusiast.

Besides, the actor, who has also made a mark as a producer, seemed interested in making a film on wildlife.

"We would like to do a film on wildlife but in a credible way. I don't think we have managed to handle this subject in a credible way. But I haven't figured out a script yet," he added.
