A young BJP leader in Assam and a few of his supporters blocked a vehicle carrying beef for carnivorous at the Assam State Zoo in Guwahati on Monday with a demand that beef supply be stopped immediately as the Hindus worship the cows.ADVERTISEMENT"Hindus worship the cows. Why can't the beef be replaced with any other meat for the animals in the zoo? They can give the sambar meat to the carnivorous," the leader, Satya Ranjan Borah said while leading the protesters. Borah, who has been making communally-sensitive statements ahead of Assembly elections slated next year, said that they would continue with the protests to stop slaughtering of cows for the consumption of animals in the state zoo. Recently, he demanded that Madrassas and the scholarship given to the Muslims be stopped.
