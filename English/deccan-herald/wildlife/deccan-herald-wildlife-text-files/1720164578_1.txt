Illegal electric fencing, installed by farmers to protect their crops from wild boars, have turned into death traps for blackbucks in Chamarajanagar.

ADVERTISEMENTThe endangered species are found in large numbers at Ummathuru Gudda, Hondarabalu and nearby forests and they stray into villages in search of fodder — fresh grass and small plants.

Blackbucks are shy in nature and flee when they spot human beings. They move in herds of five to 50 in number, led by a male deer. 

Such herds are found in Hondarabalu, Jyothigowdanapura, Kagalavadi, and Nalluru in Chamarajanagar district and Karya, Hanumanapura, Dasanuru in Mysuru district.

The farmers in the region grow jowar, sugar cane, horsegram, and ragi, which are attacked by wild boars. To prevent this, the farmers have set up electric wire fencing which is live at night. The blackbucks are falling victims to this fencing.

Decrease  in numbers

According to wildlife enthusiasts, there were hundreds of blackbucks in the region, but due to illegal electric fencing and poaching, the numbers have decreased considerably. 
Awareness should be created among farmers to conserve the animals, they opine.

Environmentalists have been demanding a 400-acre forest near Ummathuru be declared as Blackbuck Wildlife Sanctuary, which is still under consideration. 

Speaking to Deccan Herald, Director of the Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Tiger Reserve S S Lingaraju said, “Installing electric fencing illegally and killing wildlife animals is an offence. Stern action will be taken against those guilty under the Wildlife Conservation Act.”
