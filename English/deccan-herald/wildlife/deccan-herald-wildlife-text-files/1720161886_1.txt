The walkathon will begin at the High Court premises in Cubbon Park and culminate at Lalbagh. Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda will inaugurate the walkathon.

The annual event is aimed at creating awareness among citizens about protection of the wildlife. However, this year it will try and introduce a series of events to popularise the efforts made by the Forest department to preserve the wildlife of the State. Programmes such as trekking within the BNP premises will be organised for people, free of cost. 

“We are hoping that children and adults will participate in large numbers in these activities as it is holiday season. Trekking is open for people of all age groups. Each trekking batch will have 25 to 30 people and can have a real experience of the national park,” said a Forest department official.

Meanwhile, the preliminary events have already begun with the Forest department concluding the painting competition for schoolchildren in the City. On the final day, a valedictory ceremony will be held at Chowdiah Memorial Hall with Governor H R Bhardwaj distributing prizes.ADVERTISEMENT
