Agumbe Ghat will be opened for two-wheelers, cars, and minibuses from Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTDeputy Commissioner (DC) Hephsiba Rani Korlapati said the light vehicles can pass through the Ghat. However, the movement of heavy cargo vehicles is restricted. But light commercial vehicles will be allowed to ply on the Ghat road once the curing work is complete. Till then, the heavy vehicles have to pass through Udupi-Siddapura-Hosangadi-Mastikatte-Thirthahalli and Mangaluru-Karkala-Mala Ghat-Sringeri-Thirthahalli routes, the DC said in a press release.  Agumbe ghat is a major link between the coast and Malnad. The Ghat road was heavily damaged in last monsoon season and vehicular movement on the stretch was banned twice. As the curing of the concrete road is in progress, the movement of heavy cargo vehicles may pose danger.The Public Works Departmentâ€™s National Highway Division officials had earlier appealed to Shivamogga DC K A Dayanand to restrict the movement of commercial vehicles till June 1. The National Highway Division officials said some trees had to be felled to facilitate the repair works on the seventh curve of the Agumbe Ghat. The work on the stretch has been put on hold as the National Wildlife Board has not yet given permission to clear the trees. A letter has been written to the National Wildlife Board, seeking permission to take up the work. Necessary documents have been submitted in this connection. At present, temporary barriers have been placed to allow movement of vehicles.
