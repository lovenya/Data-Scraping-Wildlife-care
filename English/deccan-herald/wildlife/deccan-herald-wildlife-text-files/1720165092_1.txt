Forest land spread across 200 acres was destroyed in a wildfire around the elephant camp near at the Bandipur National Park here on Tuesday. 

ADVERTISEMENTForest department officials had a tough time controlling the spread of flames due to strong winds. Officials suspect the handiwork of miscreants behind the incident. 

Thousands of acres of forest was destroyed in a wildfire that broke out two years ago in the park. Just two weeks ago, a wildfire had erupted destroying more than 500 acres of forest under Hediyala range.

Officials say that differences of opinion between senior officials and lower-rung employees in the Forest department is the cause for the fire in the region. 

One official, on condition of anonymity, said, groupism among officials in Bandipur is at its peak. 

“Senior officers are not ready to compromise with the people residing on the fringes of the forests. 

“No steps are being taken to extend support to forest guards and staff in preventing the fire that is usually on the rise during summer. Recurring forest fires in the region is evidence to the difference of opinion among them,” he said.

Conservator of Forest and Director B B Mallesh was not available for comment on the issue.

Fire at Yettinagudda

Meanwhile, miscreants reportedly set fire in the forest at Yettinagudda area, destroying more than 150 acres of forest under Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Division, in Chamarajanagar district, on Monday. 

Local people, who spotted the fire, alerted Forest department, who in turn informed the Fire and Emergency Service personnel. 

Prakash, Range Forest Officer, MM Hill Wildlife Division, said that forest fires were on account of the shepherds and those who enter the forest in search of dry wood. A case will be booked against them and the guilty would be punished, he said.
