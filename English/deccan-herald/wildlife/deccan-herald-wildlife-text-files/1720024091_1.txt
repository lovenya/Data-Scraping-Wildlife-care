The e-ticketing service, which was launched at the Mysore Zoo on Monday, is expected to be extended to Bannerghatta and Bandipur National Parks next month, said principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and chief wildlife warden Deepak Sharma. 

ADVERTISEMENTMysore Zoo is the first in the country to provide this facility.

Speaking at the inauguration of e-ticketing system at Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens here on Monday, Sharma said the new facility will make buying tickets to visit Bannerghatta and renting out guest houses at Bandipur easier. 

He said an increasing number of tourists were heading for Bandipur and Nagarahole.

With the implementation of eco-tourism policy, private vehicles have been banned from conducting tours and only Jungle Lodges and forest department vehicles are used for safari. 

One route has been fixed for every four vehicle, and use of mobile phones has been banned on the safari.
