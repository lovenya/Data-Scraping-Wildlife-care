A city-based photography group, Thank God it’s Saturday (TGiS), is holding the sixth edition of its annual photography exhibition till June 3, 10 am onwards at Vismaya Gallery, Rangoli Metro Art Center. ADVERTISEMENTFounded by international award-winning photographers Anand Sharan and Shankar Subramanian, the group aims to support and nurture the creative skill for serious hobbyists. The exhibition, which has a theme of ‘Jaga Chitra’, showcases 100 photographs clicked by members of the group as well as persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and their families. The funds raised by selling the photographs will be donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of India (MSSI). This year’s exhibition will give patients of multiple sclerosis and their families an opportunity to share their view of the world. Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between the brain and the body. Rarely seen in children below 14, it can affect anyone from the age of 15 to 60, with women at two to three times the risk of being affected than men.“The event is extremely important to spread awareness on multiple sclerosis. I myself knew very little about this; it was an eye-opener to talk to the patients. Here we don’t want to talk about our problems, this has to change,” said actor Suman Nagarkar, the ambassador for the event.‘Jaga Chita’ literally means ‘universe taken as a picture’. The pictures showcase scenic locales, culture, wildlife, nature and people from around the world. 
Visitors can purchase the photographs which are printed on a special archival paper, which lasts for 40 years. The photographs are also customised in various sizes.
