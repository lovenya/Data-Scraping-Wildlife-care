The indefinite shutdown in Darjeeling hills since early June has dealt a body blow to the tourism industry.

Now, uncertainty over regular train services from Kolkata to north Bengal and further up to the Northeast during the festive season has put the industry in a tight spot.

Though some cracks have emerged in the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) ranks, which is spearheading the movement in the hills demanding a separate state of Gorkhaland, there has been little or no indication of lifting the shutdown anytime soon.

"We have lost the entire summer season due to the shutdown. Hill stations like Darjeeling and many spots in Sikkim, which can only be accessed via routes traversing the north Bengal hills, have become inaccessible. There was some adverse effect in the Terai and Dooars region, which also has many tourist destinations," said Santanu Chowdhury of the Siliguri-based tour operating organisation Global Connection.

"Then came the devastating floods. Though the waters have receded, the Railways are not certain when they can repair the tracks and resume services to north Bengal and Assam. We are now staring at a washout of the festive season, which continues till Diwali. We have stopped calculating our losses," Chowdhury told DH. 

The railway authorities on Thursday said trains to north Bengal and Assam from Kolkata will remain suspended at least till September 15.

"Flights are operating, but all tourists cannot afford them. They had planned their tours in Dooars, Terai, Assam and the Northeast and also to Bhutan, keeping Darjeeling and Sikkim out of their itinerary. With this uncertainty over the running of trains, even they are cancelling their bookings. It is a double blow for us," said a resort owner in Lataguri, the gateway to the Gorumara Wildlife Sanctuary.ADVERTISEMENT
