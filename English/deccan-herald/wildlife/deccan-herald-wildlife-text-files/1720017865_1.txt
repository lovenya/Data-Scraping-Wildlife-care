After the day-long drive, the students collected more than 200 sacks of plastic from the well known tourist spot and pilgrim centre.

BFRC Principal Pushpakumar told Deccan Herald that that it wasnâ€™t necessary for only National Service Scheme camps to undertake such a drive. Everyday, thousands of people visit the BRT Wildlife Sanctuary and throw plastic all over the area. This is causing immense harm to wild animals.

Keeping this mind, more than 200 students took up the initiative to clean the roads, he added.

Nagendra, a villager opined that if the panchayat had taken up the work, it would have cost Rs three lakh. But the youngsters showed that an initiative by the public can save a lot of money, he added.

Students S Mamatha, Akhila, Sowmya and Rajendra, who participated in the clean-up pointed out that everyday passes away in studies. But, this gave an opportunity for them to make a contribution to the society. Bannari Amman Sugars Director Sharavan gifted 200 T-shirts and caps to students who participated in the cleanliness drive. 

Taluk Administration had arranged for lunch and District Bus Owners Association provided free bus service to the students. 

District Administration also gave away certificate of participation to the students.
