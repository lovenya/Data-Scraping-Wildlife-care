The British royal Couple – Prince William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, played parents to orphan animal cubs from Kaziranga and fed them milk.

ADVERTISEMENTOn Wednesday afternoon, the royal couple visited IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) near Kaziranga National Park, one of its kind animal rescue and rehabilitation Centre in Asia.

They were excited and interacted with the animal keepers and even hand fed some of the orphaned animals being reared at CWRC.

 They fed elephant calves Buree and Murphuli, who were just a few months old when they were rescued in October last year, now being raised on milk formula under the watchful eyes of their keepers; and Dunga, a male rhino, the youngest and newest resident at CWRC and the best of friends with the two female elephant calves.
The Duchess was most interested in knowing more about the youngest rhino calf at the Centre. 

A specially created photo album with information on each animal they saw was given to the royal couple as a gift.

As of March 2016, the Centre had handled 4,322 animal cases with 2,465 being released back to the wild – a rehabilitation rate of nearly 60%.

Later the royal couple visited the site of the upcoming Kaziranga Discovery Park, a clinic for (and learning centre on) Asian elephants being developed by the UK-based NGO Elephant Family in collaboration with the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).

The Royal couple interacted with villagers of Ram Terang village, located in the autonomous tribal Karbi Anglong hills in Assam, which earlier lay right in the middle of an ancient elephant route.
