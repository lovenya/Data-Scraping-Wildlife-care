Wildlife Conservationist Ullas Karanth, who has been selected for the Padma Shri award, today said conferment of the honour reflects government's seriousness towards wildlife conservation.

ADVERTISEMENT"Not many wildlife conservationists have been honoured with Padma awards. The announcement to confer the award upon me reflects government's seriousness towards wildlife conservation," he told PTI here. Expressing happiness, he said he hadÂ  been working in this field for the last 25 years. "I would like to share this award with my group of scientists and colleagues who have worked with me," he said.

Karanth, however, took the opportunity to urge the government to implement recommendations submitted by various experts including wildlife conservationists like him. "We need to balance economic growth and ecological issues by bringing back conservation ethos into the reckoning," Karanth said.
