“But soon this will come to an end. The place which could've been transformed into an eco-tourism centre will instead become an estuary saturated with slush, rattling along with car smoke swirling down from the trans-harbour bridge...all because the state government for some strange reason refuses to look at scientific studies and rework the project,” said Bombay Natural History Society director Dr Asad Rahmani in a public meeting held at Hornbill House in south Mumbai.

Making it clear that the neither naturalists nor environmentalists were against the development project, Dr Rahmani, who is also a standing committee member of the National Board for Wildlife, pointed out that when the state government was recently asked about the revival of a project lying in the cold storage for the past six years, “the government said that they have an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report dating back to 1992. And the same goes to the public hearing.”

However, the state government officials were unable to provide the 1992 EIA report purportedly clearing the trans-harbour line idea. 

“Six years ago when the project was mooted, we met state government officials and convinced them that the project should take into cognisance not only the migratory birds but also vascular plants and other creatures who have managed to survive despite the polluting effulgent and toxic chemicals churned out in tons from the nearby petroleum refineries and BARC which are dumped into the waters along Mahul-Sewri coastal belt. However, ironically this time they have not bothered to reply to our query,” Dr Rahmani informed.
