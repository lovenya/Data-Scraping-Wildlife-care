Addressing a meeting organised to discuss about the implementation of Forest Rights Act at Nagarahole Tribal colony here on Thursday, he said that the government had introduced the Act after hearing the problems of tribals. The Act was brought with the objective of solving the problems of tribals, he added. 

“The Forest Rights Act has been drafted studying all the problems of the tribals. Nobody can obstruct the implementation of the Act. Officials cannot force tribals to evict from the forest,” he said and called upon officials to treat uneducated tribals fairly. 

Officials should allow tribals to live in their dwellings in the forest, he said adding, “it is a rule of the nature and should be followed strictly.”

There is a need of comprehensive change in the rules to facilitate tribals to own the land which they are cultivating. The Forest Rights Act also has social bound. It emphasises the preservation of tribal traditions, beliefs and culture, Vishwanath said. “Problems are arising in the implementation of the Act only because of the lack of knowledge among offcials. Hence, training should be imparted to officials on Forest Rights Act,” he added.
 
The decision by the team formed by the Deputy Commissioner with regard to the implementation of the Act will be final, he said adding that the Act will be implemented properly after holding discussion with officials within three months. 

Assistant Commissioner Ravi said that while 1,829 applications have been received with regard to forest rights in Virajpet, 1,598 are of Scheduled Tribe families and 199 are from other communities. 

Nagarahole Wild Life Division Deputy Conservator of Forest Vijayaranjan Singh said that there are provisions in the Act to provide rehabilitation for tribals, who live in the micro wildlife region. The government provides Rs 10 lakh as compensation, if tribals are willing to leave the forest, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
