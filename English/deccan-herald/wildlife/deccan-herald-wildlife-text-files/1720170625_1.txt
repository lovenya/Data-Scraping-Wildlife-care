There are few pleasures as unsullied as sitting or walking along a clean sandy beach just before the sun comes out, heralding the dawn of a new year. No matter what you want to do on the morning of 2019 – sunbathing, shell collecting, swimming, or just watching the waves crash on the sand, then beach destinations such as Gokarna, Murudeshwar, Devbagh, Mangaluru, Udupi, Karwar, and Kundapur are for you. Do it on your own, with family and friends, or book a beach resort which plans your celebration for you. Beach bonfires are also quite popular nowadays. Remember, the secret to happiness can be found on a beach, in quiet contemplation with a view of the waves.<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2FOm.jpg?w=1200" alt="Om Beach, Gokarna"/>Om Beach, GokarnaTemple hoppersIf thanking the Almighty for a year well spent, and praying him for a relaxed and peaceful 2019 is what you wish, then head to any of the holy sites in the State. Sringeri, Kollur, Kateel, Anegudde, Horanadu, Murudeshwar… the list could go on. Staying in the temple towns with their unhurried pace, experiencing the calm and quiet of the place, partaking in the temple prasada, visiting the many tiny shops around the temples, spending some contemplative moments on the banks of water bodies that are found in most of these places, and taking long walks with the shadow of the moon following you, you realise the year that’s just beginning spells hope. Yes, temple towns could be the answer to your prayers for a perfect beginning to the new year.Charmed by the churchThe joy of attending the midnight mass in churches on New Year’s Eve is unparalleled. Singing hymns in praise of the Lord, offering prayers, and thanking Him for all the good things in life can be an ideal way to mark the beginning of the new year. In Bengaluru, there’s The Holy Trinity Church and St. Mary’s Basilica, in Mysuru is St. Philomena’s Church, in Mangaluru is Milagres Church and St. Aloysius Chapel, in Karkala is St. Lawrence Shrine or Attur Church among many others in the State. Ushering in the new year in pious reflection could be the beginning of good times.Wild, wild folkAre you a wildlife lover? A birdwatcher? Or a person who’d love to spend the first morning of 2019 in the company of the beasts of the wild? Then head to the many wildlife sanctuaries of the State. From Bandipur, Nagarhole, Dandeli and Bhadra wildlife sanctuaries to BR Hills, Ranganathittu, Kabini and Dubare Elephant Camp, there are plenty of options that thrill you no end. Waking up to the chirping of birds, or the roaring of lions, and inhaling the fresh scent of unpolluted air, you will be left wondering what you are doing in a city that only offers you the blaring of horns, and dust and pollution. However, booking accommodation inside wildlife parks needs to be done in advance, so plan ahead and welcome 2019 in a wild, wild way.<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2Fbr-hills-view-from-temple.jpg?w=1200" alt="B R Hills"/>B R Hills
