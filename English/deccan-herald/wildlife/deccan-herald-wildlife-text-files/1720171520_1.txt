The Indian travel show '10 Things To Do Before You Say Bye' will showcase Moreton Island, the Gold Coast and Tropical North Queensland to a viewing public of 61 million when it goes on air in 2011, according to an AAP report.

State tourism chief executive Anthony Hayes said that the show is being filmed since yesterday and is set to capture 10 different experiences around each destination, including luxury, adventure, food, nature and wildlife.

It will show a crew enjoying sand tobogganing, wild dolphin feeding on Moreton Island and a visit to Dreamworld, besides displaying Great Barrier Reef, jungle surfing at Cape Tribulation and jet ride in Gold coast.

Hayes said the lifestyle channel show is being broadcast to attract the affluent, cosmopolitan kind of audience, a prime market for Queensland.

"The Indian market is becoming increasingly affluent and with Indians attracted by lifestyle and family friendly holiday options, as well as world-class reef and rainforest experiences, Queensland has great appeal to this market," he said.

The report said that Queensland's tourism industry is hoping that the new television show would convince Indian travellers to put a trip to the sunshine state on their "bucket list".

Figures show that 24,000 Indians holidayed in the state in the year ending September.
A Tourism Queensland briefing to the industry in September told attendees the importance of the Indian market.

Indian travellers were keen to spend on fashion, as well as check out the country's unique natural offerings, Paul Buggy, regional director for Korea, India and Gulf countries, had said at that time.

"The greatest advertising we can do in that part of the world is let the people speak for themselves because they do go home to their family unit and friends, and they talk about the experiences that they've had," Buggy had said, adding "so the brag value. You just can't put a value on it because it's enormous."ADVERTISEMENT
