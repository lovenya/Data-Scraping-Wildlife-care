“We expect the two countries to carry forward with what media is calling cricket diplomacy. We applaud the talks that are taking place on a host of issues including homeland and security matters,” US Ambassador Timothy J. Roemer told reporters on the sidelines of his visit to the Delhi Zoo with slum children studying at an NGO.

“India and Pakistan will take the talks forward at their own pace, ability, and character. Talks combined with cricket diplomacy, people-to-people ties and optimism can help make it a success,” he said.

Home Secretary G.K. Pillai and his Pakistani counterpart Qamar Zamam met here Monday-Tuesday to discuss issues like counter-terrorism and the visa regime.

Roemer and his wife Sally Roemer visited the zoo with 32 children studying a english language programme at NGO Making a Difference.

"The children were keen to know about wildlife. I and Sally found this to be the best way to give them some practical knowledge," Roemer said.ADVERTISEMENT
