Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan today took all his 23 newly-inducted ministers in a state tourism bus to a wildlife sanctuary near here for an interactive session, and asked them to strive to ensure a clean image of government and the party.

ADVERTISEMENT"The chief minister advised them to remain alert about the image of the government, party and their own while discharging their duties as ministers," a party source said.

Chouhan, who expanded his Cabinet yesterday by inducting 19 Ministers of the Cabinet rank and four Ministers of State, took all of them in an MP Tourism Development Corporation (MPTDC) bus to Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary.

In the wake of corruption charges against the personal staff of a few of the earlier Cabinet ministers, Chouhan advised them to ensure that they should not appoint such a person, who may create problems for them in future and also asked them to keep a close watch on them, the sources said.

The chief minister asked them to remain in the state capital every Monday and Tuesday and not to delay files coming to their tables.

The ministers also gave their suggestions to him on governance.
Later, Chouhan's Principal Secretary, Manoj Shrivastava also briefed the ministers about the rules of business and discussed the Vision document-2018, the sources said. PTI MAS NP SHS 12222051
