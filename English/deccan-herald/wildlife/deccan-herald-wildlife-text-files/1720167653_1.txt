A lioness got electrocuted to death after coming in contact with the wires of a barbed fencing put up illegally by farmers around their fields in Khamba taluka of Amreli district, forest officials said.

Two persons -- Mohammad Kalu and Abdul Ibrahim -- both hailing from Dedar village in the taluka were arrested for the offence under the provisions of the Wildlife Act.

"A lioness in the age group of 3-5 years was killed after getting electrocuted from a barbed wire fencing. Local farmers have erected barbed fences around their farms and connected it with the wire drawn illegally from electricity pole to protest the field from wild animals," said Deputy Conservator of Forest, Amreli, T Karuppasamy.

A team of the Forest Department is probing at the spot where the carcass of the lioness was found, the Deputy Conservator said.
