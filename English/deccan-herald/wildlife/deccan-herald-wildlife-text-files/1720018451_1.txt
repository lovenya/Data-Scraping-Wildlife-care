Translated from the original Kannada version by S R Ramakrishna, the book is lucid and soulful. The authors tell their tale in a free-flowing and simple manner so as to underscore the human element of the episode, bereft of any pontification or politics.

The reader is left free to form his own conclusions about the “near-mythical villain” Veerappan, who is spared any value judgement and is, at times, made to come across as a gifted, paradoxical victim of his circumstances. For instance, he is quoted as saying “...humans are so cruel. There’s no animal on this earth this cruel. Only humans cheat, take revenge, do unjust things, suspect… They capture elephants and sell them to circuses. They torture them and make money. They make garlands out of ivory and trade them. 

They chop off their legs and make stools. Humans are low creatures, aren’t they?” Such ironic utterances make one reflect on the not-so-dark side of Veerappan. Of course, the book does not deal with his earlier and later misadventures in detail.

The book holds true to its description of “a caper story”, replete with sub-plots, conversations, hunts and drama. Veerappan’s colleagues Anburaj, Sethukuli, Madesha and Rangaswamy are all unique characters as is co-captive Dr Maithi — a fatalist, agri-scientist. Krupakar and Senani see the gang as almost pious folks, who “believe in God,” and twice daily “wash their hands and feet, wear their uniforms, place their guns by their sides, and offer prayers for five minutes”, while Veerapan himself “sometimes muttered a sloka”. The anecdotal approach to the work makes for compelling reading.

Quite obviously, those looking for details of police operations in Bandipur or political manoeuvring of the Karnataka Government (or for that matter, Veerappan-bashing) must look elsewhere. The book is for those who enjoy a real life story with shades of grey in a lush forest. The description of the natural settings of the forests is fascinating, and makes one feel like he is ‘watching the book’. Perhaps, a film based on the book is in order.

The outstanding feature of the book is constant verbal and non-verbal communication between the captors and the captive —- their mutual regard, their witty exchanges, their subtle manipulations and their near-friendship leading to a tearful climax. 

While credit is due to Senani and Krupakar for their mental toughness and their ability to recall minute details of the episode, as well as their fabulous knowledge of the forest, they have found in Ram an ideal translator who does full justice to their extraordinary adventure. Having earlier translated poet Siddalingiah’s celebrated autobiography Ooru Keri (Village), Ram represents a breed of scholars who don’t just write skillfully, but also translate with empathy. One is reminded that all of Marquez’s works are translated from the Spanish. But for such efforts, much high quality literature would remain limited by language.
