Union Minister for Environment and Forests, Prakash Javadekar has said that he has not received any proposal from the State government seeking protected tiger reserve tag for Cauvery Wild­life Sanctuary and Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife  Sanctuary, reports DHNS from Chamarajanagar.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to reporters after visiting Biligiri Ranganatha Tiger Reserve in the district on Sunday, Javadekar said that he would write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in this regard soon. He said that he would visit  two tiger reserves every month to take stock of problems there. 

The minister said that around 300 applications seeking permission for eco-sensitive zones around protected areas will be approved by March next. 

“The ministry has so far received about 500 applications from states, seeking permission to declare 10-km area around national parks and wildlife sanctuaries as eco-sensitive zones. The government is committed to protect forests. The Centre will take a decision. However, applications would be scrutinised properly before going ahead with approval,” he added.
