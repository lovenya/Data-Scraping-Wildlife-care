The work on resort construction at Chandradrona hill which is a part of the Western Ghat, has been stopped, thanks to the district administration, which has finally paid heed to the voice of the people and the media.

ADVERTISEMENT‘Deccan Herald’ had made extensive coverage on the effects of resort construction, which were mushrooming at the foot of Chandradrona hill. Several organisations and NGOs too has raised their voice against the resort and home stay culture in the sensitive Western Ghat region. Finally, the district administration has woke up to the situation from its slumber and has taken a major decision to cancel the permission given for land conversion for constructing home stays in the region. 

Deputy Commissioner D K Rangaswamy in the order dated May 30, has cancelled the permission given to Satori Eco Adventure Resort Co. for constructing resorts in the hill range. The activists including Bhadra Wild Life Conservation Trust Manager D V Gireesh, Wild Cat-C Trust Sridevi Hulikere and wildlife conservation activist G Veeresh have welcomed the DC’s order. 

It is said that the district administration has cancelled the permission based on the report submitted by the Mines and Geology Department. The report talks about the iron ore in the land where the Company was building the resort. Due to the iron ore in the region, there might be the occurrence of landslide if the construction is taken up. 
Moreover, the high population and vehicles that arrive at the resort too would cause problem during the rainy season. Letting the waste water flow in the area, would cause problem to the water sources, said the report. 

In fact, the Forest Department too had raised its voice against the project as the land nurtures some of the rarest medicinal plants and comes within 10 km radius of Bhadra Tiger project. The Department had also filed a complaint questioning the company acquiring the forest and revenue land.
