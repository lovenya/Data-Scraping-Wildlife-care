In a letter, Praveen Bhargav, member of National Board of Wildlife and K M Chinappa, trustee Wildlife First have sought implementation of the Supreme Court order which suggests no cutting of trees and road widening.

The letter to the Chief Secretary reminds that the Supreme Court had directed several mitigation measures which includes the construction of 15 major culverts, ban on vehicular movement except patrol vehicles and ambulance between 6 am to 6 pm and constitution of a committee headed by Principal Secretary (Forests) with Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and two reputed NGOs to monitor repair and mitigation measures.
Citing a study by scientists, who have identified Nagarhole-Bandipur landscape as a high priority area for conservation of Asiatic elephant and tigers, the letter says that the diversion of Damanakatte-Udbur junction assumes greater importance and the State must take it for implementation at the earliest.

Misleading govt
Citing the World Bank letter to them, the wildlife First has said that though the World Bank has expressed its commitment to save the big cats, the Karnataka State Highway Implementation Project (KSHIP) seems to be misleading the State Government with regard to World Bank position.

Requesting the State to take up environmentally sound decision to implement the ecologically viable underpasses for wildlife, the NGO has said that the road connecting Damanakatte and Udbur will not only benefit the villages outside the reserve, but will also reduce the impact of the road.ADVERTISEMENT
