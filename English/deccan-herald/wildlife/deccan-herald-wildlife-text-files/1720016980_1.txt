Initially, they were mistaken for litter. On close examination, they discovered that they were leopard cubs and tried to feed them milk. A leopard had been spotted a few days ago on the outskirts of the village. The villagers assumed that the cubs may belong to it. The cubs were later handed over to the Forest officials who shifted them to the Adumalleshwara Zoo.
