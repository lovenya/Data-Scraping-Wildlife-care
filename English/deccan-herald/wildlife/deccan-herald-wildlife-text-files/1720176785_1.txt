Seemingly unfazed by the exit polls, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has exuded confidence that the BJP will return to power in Madhya Pradesh a record fourth time with a comfortable majority.ADVERTISEMENTMost exit polls broadcast on Friday have predicted either keen contest between the BJP and the Congress or a slight edge to the Opposition party.“ I am the biggest surveyor who is in constant touch with the people and I know that the BJP is going to form next government with the majority”, the chief minister told newsmen in Umaria district on Saturday. He had returned from the Bandhavgarh national park where he vacationed with family for two days amid wildlife.   He also went to famous Maa Pitambara temple in Datia to seek blessing of the presiding deity there. Here too he reiterated confidence in the BJP’s victory, saying he has always enjoyed benediction of the Maa Pitambara.However, the exit polls have induced a sense of despondency in the BJP camp while the Congress looks confident of victory. MPCC president Kamal Nath has already claimed that his party is winning 140 seats in the 230-strong state assembly.
