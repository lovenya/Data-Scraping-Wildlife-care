Addressing a press meet here on Friday, he said if Western Ghats are included into the UNESCO list, then it would benefit the environmentalusts. Those who are demanding the inclusion of Western Ghats, do not have concern over the country and the environment. 

The NGOs and pseudo environmentalists are demanding the inclusion of Western Ghats in UNESCO list to get funds from the foreign countries. It is a tragedy that Union Minister Jairam Ramesh is supporting the views of such environmentalists. 

“The environmentalists have been stating that UNESCO list will promote the growth of tourism in the region. Increase in the inflow of tourists will affect environment,” he added. If Western Ghats will be developed by including in the UNESCO list, then there is a need to declare entire country as heritage spot. 

“NGOs are more dangerous than Yoga guru Baba Ramdev who owns property worth crores. Baba atleast teachers yoga to few. However, NGOs are engaged in making money,” he added. 

Subbaiah welcomed the move of the State government to drop heritage tag to Western Ghats. The government should not change its mind in future, he said.
