“The time has come to show that both man and animal can co-exist without giving any scope for confrontation,” said Kumble, who was here in connection with the valedictory function of Youth Club of Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens. There was urgent need to protect whatever wild animals left in Karnataka forests, he felt.
After assuming office as vice-chairman of Wildlife Board, he had visited Bandipur National Park and interacted with field staff and also with forest officials working in the national park.He came across several shortfalls in maintaining the national park and discused problems of the staff. He would submit a detailed report to the State government for action. 

He said he would also be visiting Nagarhole National park to study problems and issues. Protection of flora and fauna is everybody’s duty and participation of general public in this endeavour is a must. 

Patrolling must

Asked about his impressions of his visit to Bandipur National Park, Kumble said every State is facing one or the other problems in regard to protection of flora and fauna. As for Karnataka, there is an critical need to intensify patrolling of roads that pass through national parks in order to check rash and negligent driving. People tended to drive vehicles in neck-break speed without concerns for animals, resulting in death of wild animals.

Kumble said the Wildlife Board intended to help the Department of Forest which is striving for protection of natural resources. He would like to meet villagers and understand their problems in order to put an end to the problem of man-animal confrontation especially in villages bordering forests. The problem of animals straying into villages is because of encroachment of forest by people. NGOs will be involved in the efforts.ADVERTISEMENT
