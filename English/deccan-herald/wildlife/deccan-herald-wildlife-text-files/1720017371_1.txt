As many as six elephants were used in the ‘operation Nagapuri’ to catch the rogue elephant. Out of six elephants, Harsha and Vikram had arrived from Dubare elephant camp in Kodagu, Abhimanyu and Gajendra from Hunsur Wildlife division, while a new tusker and Geetha were being brought from Sakrebayalu elephant camp. 

Abhimanya had so far participated in 80 such operations and had helped in nabbing 15 elephants. Mahout Sannappa who was looking after Abhimanyu retired from the sergice recently. In his place, his son Vasanth, is taking care of the jumbo.

This rogue elephant had created terror in the whole taluk in the last five months and had killed two persons besides damaging crops worth lakhs of rupees. The villagers heaved a sigh of relief after they came to know that the marauding elephant was nabbed.

This is the first time, the forest department has caught the rogue elephant within a week.
