Minister for Forests B Ramanath Rai said that State government would strongly oppose the draft notification issued by the Central government on Kasturi Rangan report.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to media persons, on the sidelines of the inaugural ceremony of 61st Wildlife Week here on Thursday, the minister said that opposition parties were misleading the people on the issue.

He said that the Central government’s decision to ignore the report sent by the Karnataka government on Kasturi Rangan recommendations was condemnable. 
Incidentally, the Centre had also given acknowledgment for the report.

He said that the Parliamentarians from the region were not performing their duties. They are not working for the people who had voted for them. The government will give its objections to the draft notification which has a time period of up to 60 days. 

The State government had left out the human habitat in the recommendations, he said and added that the recommendations were not taken into consideration. He said the Central government had approved a report sent by Kerala some two years ago.

The Central government blames State government, hence, it has included Karnataka along with other States that have not submitted the report. A scientific study is taken up to prepare the report. He also ridiculed the blame game by the opposition members.

Alleging that the former BJP government had approved the Tiger Reserve Project, the minister said that the State  government would not approve the project.

He added that Chief Minister and Major Irrigation Minister should answer all the questions. He said as many as 32 hectares of forest land will be given to construct road in Shiradi Ghat.
