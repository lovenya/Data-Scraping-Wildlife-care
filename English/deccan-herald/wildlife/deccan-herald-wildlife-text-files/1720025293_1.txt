Farmers have been losing crops following diseases affecting the crops and heavy rains. Now, animals especially monkey menace, have become a headache for the farmers in Kadaba.

 With the monkey menace assuming alarming proportions in various parts of Kadaba and the efforts to tackle the problem being inadequate, complaints have started mounting in the region. In the past, monkeys were seen only during paddy harvesting season. However, now the monkey menace have become daily affair here, said farmers. ADVERTISEMENT
Farmers have suffered extensive damage to their crops, mainly vegetables, banana, coconuts in the attacks by packs of ferocious monkeys. 

Speaking to Deccan Herald, a farmer said “the monkeys climb coconut trees and drink tender coconuts in dozens. If the situation continues, then there will be acute shortage of coconuts in the future.” 

“We have been bursting crackers to chase  away monkeys. However, now the monkeys are not scared of crackers. We can not kill monkeys as wildlife Act comes as a hindrance,” he added. 

Monkey menace is on rise in Koila, Alankar, Savanoor, Belandoor, Charvaka and other villages in Kadaba hobli for the last one year. “We have lost crops like coconut, vegetables, arecanut, banana worth lakh of rupees.

 We had submitted a memorandum to former chief minister D V Sadananda Gowda on the need to tackle, with a sense of urgency, problems confronting people on account of  animals. The CM had directed the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner to initiate measures to tackle the menace. However, none of the officials have visited us even after one year,” said the farmers. 
Farmers have urged the authorities to catch monkeys and release them inside the forest.
