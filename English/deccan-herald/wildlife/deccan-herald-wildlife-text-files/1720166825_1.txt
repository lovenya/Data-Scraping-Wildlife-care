Karnataka Aranya Moola Budakattu Samudayagala Okkoota district convener Y P Thimmaiah said they will picket Vidhana Soudha on August 20 seeking the fulfillment of their various demands.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing mediapersons in Madikeri on Wednesday, he said every tribal family living outside the forest land must be given five acres of paisari land. The land encroached by influential people should be cleared and should be distributed among poor. Title deeds and forest rights should be provided to families dwelling in devara kadu areas in the district, he demanded.

Association member Paniyara Gappu said families living in coffee estates should be rehabilitated with land. He said the tribal families are deprived of basic amenities. Four hundred acres of land should be given to tribals as the district in-charge minister has made a statement in this regard, he added.

Various facilities are being provided to Assamese and Tibetans who have migrated to the district. But, the tribals, who are originally from the district, deprived of basic facilities, he regretted. Association members Prema, Madevi, J K Dasappa and others were present at the press meet.

Protest held

The tribals staged a protest in front of the DC’s office here on Thursday demanding the fulfilment of thier various demands, including five acres land to a tribal family.
 The rule that every tribal family dwelling in the forest land should be provided with four hectares of land is not yet implemented by the government. The tribals have been preserving the forests and wildlife from the past many years.

But, the Forest Rights Act - 2006, has not been implemented in Kodagu till today, he claimed. Later, the protesters submitted a memorandum to the Additional DC Sathish Kumar.
