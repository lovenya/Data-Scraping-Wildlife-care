Life almost slipped away from this 35-year-old tusker when marching orders were issued to shoot him dead. But destiny had willed otherwise. ADVERTISEMENTThis bull tusker trampled five people to death between August and November last year in the Narendranagar area of Uttarakhand, about 30 km from here.

The matter turned worse after he struck his fifth victim. "About 20 people have been killed by elephants since 2008 in the region, of which five were killed by this tusker last year," said Divisional Forest Officer of Narendranagar Forest Division N N Pandey. They were killed on roads outside the reserve, he added. 

Orders were then issued onNovember 7 by the forest department to shoot him. Though the process of elimination had started, a rescue effort was also on simultaneously to capture and translocate the animal to a nearby reserve. Pandey said Section 11 of the Wildlife Protection Act that sanctions killing also provides for capture and relocation. Experts from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), forest department and the NGO Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) spearheaded the operation.
