Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said there is a challenge for the government when choosing between democracy and environment.ADVERTISEMENTCiting the implementation of the Madhav Gadgil report, he said ordinary people regard democracy as construction of homes, schools and hospitals, while environment is a larger issue.The issues could be addressed if people are convinced, but since it is not the case, it leaves politicians with little choice. This cost the Congress a seat, Tharoor said.The MP spoke to citizens at a consultation event organised by the AICC to gather people’s opinion for the Congress’ 2019 election manifesto.While citizen activists attending the meeting wanted measures to improve the urban ecology, wildlife enthusiasts urged the party to take measures to protect the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and Western Ghats.Tharoor said the Congress was creating a manifesto covering 20 odd areas like education, national security and foreign policy. He was given subjects — culture, media’s fear of expression and liberty, and environment.Environment curriculumTo a suggestion, Tharoor said the idea to create an environment curriculum was a welcome idea. Since 90% of the education is under the state’s control, he said the Centre can set an example by incorporating environment curriculum through the CBSE.Citizens faulted the Congress government for environmental degradation, saying the party’s pro-industry policies ruined the environment. They said the Congress dismantled the committee of disinvestment set up
by the BJP government, asking the grand old party to take cognizance of its previous mistakes.They wanted the Congress to form a national water policy, manage dust pollution, implement the 74th amendment, cease to use fossil fuel for energy, address climate change, amend the transportation economic model and implement solid waste management.
