"Humans clearly use laughter as an important response in a wide range of social situations, but it is particularly interesting that chimpanzees seem to also use laughter to respond in such distinct ways," said Marina Davila-Ross of Portsmouth University, who led the study, as saying.

The scientists have based their findings on an analysis of laughter in 59 chimpanzees at Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia in Africa. "We found their responsive laughter shows a similarity to the conversational laughter of humans," 'The Independent' quoted Davila-Ross as saying.ADVERTISEMENT
