Home Minister K J George said on Wednesday that his son Rana George, also a member of the State Wildlife Board, had no role in the release of a tiger into the Khanapur forests and its death while catching it again. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe minister told reporters in Hubballi,  “As far as I know, he helped in the operation to catch the tiger near our estate in Chikkamagaluru district. The principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) orders the release and catching of wild tigers, as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority guidelines,” he said.

George stated that his son was a wildlife enthusiast and he was the honorary wildlife warden for Chikkamagalur district since the time of the JD(S)-BJP coalition government. 

“In the background of a private complaint, the court has ordered investigation. Let him face the action, if he is found guilty,” George noted.

The meeting to finalise the name of the new DG&IGP would be held on Friday, and out of four eligible officials, one name would be recommended for the post to the chief minister, he noted.

The minister said that police constables would be allowed to stay at the same police station for more than five years and that they would be transferred within the district.

George said that police officials had been instructed to consider cricket bookies as history-sheeters and take stringent action against cricket betting.

George has ruled out the possibility of bifurcating the Bengaluru City Police Commissionerate and said that the present system was working well and there was no need to bifurcate it.

Speaking to mediapersons in Dharwad, George said that the government was not considering any proposal to bifurcate the Commissionerate. He also ruled out delimitation of jurisdiction of police stations in Bengaluru City.
