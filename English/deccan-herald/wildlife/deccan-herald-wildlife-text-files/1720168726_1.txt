Forest personnel staged a protest, keeping the body of guard Murigeppa Tammanagol who died while trying to control wildfire in Kalkere range, Bandipur tiger reserve in HD Kote taluk, at Aranya Bhavan on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENTThey said the authorities failed to inform the kin of the deceased and the family came to know about the tragedy late at night only after watching TV.

They demanded that a compensation of Rs 40 lakh be paid to the family of Murigeppa, on a par with the compensation given to police personnel who die while on duty. Deceased forest personnel are given only Rs 5 lakh as compensation, they claimed. The forest department has no modern equipment to douse fire. The officers are unaware of the problems faced by the guards, they said. 

The agitators called off the protest after Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) B J Hosmath informed that Murigeppa’s wife was seven months pregnant and it was not right to make the family wait longer to conduct the last rites. Hosmath said he would call on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday and discuss providing a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a job to the wife of the victim.
