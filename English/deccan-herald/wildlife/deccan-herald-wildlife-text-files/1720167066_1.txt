The compensation paid to the forest staffers who lay down their lives while on duty will be doubled to Rs 10 lakh, Forest, Environment and Ecology Minister Ramanath Rai has said.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to reporters after taking part in the Forest Martyrs’ Day on Sunday, Rai said that at present the martyrs’ families get Rs five lakh as compensation. The additional money will be given from the Tiger Foundation.

Rai said that attempts will be made to provide jobs on compassionate grounds to the family members. He said that the Union government had no objection to declare Kudremukh National Park as a tiger reserve, but the tag was being delayed due to resistance from local people and politicians in the state.

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), B J Hosmath said that the Forest department will hold talks with the Centre and police officers on disposal of ivory stocked in Mysuru. The issue will be taken up in a meeting scheduled for September 20.

The department has a stock of 22 tonnes of ivory piled up in Gandhada Kote for the past four decades apart from seven tonnes of sandalwood trees. Though sandalwood trees are sold periodically, no steps had been taken to dispose off the ivory, Hosmath said.
