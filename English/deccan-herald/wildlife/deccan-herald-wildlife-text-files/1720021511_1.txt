The Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) is all set to avail a loan of Rs 50 crore from Karnataka Infrastructure Development Corporation for developing the park and surrounding areas.  

ADVERTISEMENTAnnouncing this after inaugurating the new entrance plaza at BBP on Monday, Forest Minister C P Yogeeshwar said the department has prepared a new master plan which envisages a leopard safari and a rescue centre following incidents of leopard attacks. Besides this, the tiger and lion safari will be extended to make more room for the big cats.

A botanical garden, bird park, primate park and a reptile park are also part of the master plan. An interpretation wildlife centre is also being planned where the public will be educated about forests and its dwellers.

MLA M Krishnappa agreed to allot Rs 20 lakh from the MLA funds for the construction of a building for hawkers to sell quality food at a designated place instead of evicting them.

M N Nanjundaswamy, chairperson of the Karnataka Zoo Authority, said he would ensure that animal exchange programmes are extended to the BBP too and not just Mysore zoo. With regard to the confirmation of 450-odd workers of BBP, he said once the changes are made in the Cadre and Recruitment Rules, workers will be confirmed.

‘Greed causing man-animal conflict’
Forest Minister C P Yogeeshwar blamed human greed, in the form of encroachment of forest land, as the reason for man-animal conflict.

 “In view of the recent elephant attack in Anekal-Bannerghatta area, the department plans to spend Rs 350 crore to prevent wildlife from entering cities and towns, by constructing boundary walls and erecting solar fences around forest area,” he said.
