Twenty five animal keepers from 13 zoos of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are participating in the six-day training programme.


Continuing, Lakshmana suggested that ‘Aloka’ near Yelwala be taken up by the zoo so that animals bought to the zoo can initially be placed there, thus avoiding the risk of spreading infection. He said that presently, whenever a zoo brings a new animal it is placed alongside existing animals. If any of the new bought animals are infected by any disease, then there is a chance of the disease spreading among other animals.

Kind-hearted

Addressing animal keepers, Lakshmana said that they should know about the nature of the animals. Advising animal keepers to be kind-hearted, he said that it is also necessary to treat the animals with love and affection. 

Zoo Executive Director Markandaiah said that the quality of the zoo reflects the quality of the environment. Emphasising on the importance of zoo keepers, he said that their longevity depends on the way they are treated.

He urged participants of the training programme to share their practical experiences so that they can learn about the difficulties and solutions in looking after animals.

He said that the Mysore Zoo has grown from strength to strength. He urged animal keepers to record the habits of the animals so that it will help in analysing the behaviour of animals.
Karnataka Zoo Authority Chairman Nanjundswamy and Member-Secretary B J Hosamutt were also present.ADVERTISEMENT
