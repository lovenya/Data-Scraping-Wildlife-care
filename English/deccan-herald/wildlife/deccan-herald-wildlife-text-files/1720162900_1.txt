It seems the mild and calm natured Balarama, 57, will perform the role of ‘Pattada Aane’ during the coronation of Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar on May 28.

ADVERTISEMENTThe erstwhile royal family has written to the State government, on Saturday, to provide elephant Balarama to perform the role of ‘Pattada Aane’ during the ceremony. The letter that was forwarded to the Palace Board, has been sent to the office of Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF), Mysuru.

DCF V Karikalan, who confirmed to have received the letter, told Deccan Herald, the request has been duly forwarded to the office of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, Bengaluru. The matter is before the government and the reply is awaited.

Dr Nagaraj, forest department veterinarian, said, “Balarama was recommended by the department, when the erstwhile royal family sought an alternative for Gajendra, that was performing the role during Navaratri celebrations till previous Dasara”.

Gajendra was recently in news for the wrong reasons, after goring its mahout to death at K Gudi camp and later seriously injuring fellow Dasara elephant Srirama. 

Srirama succumbed to the injuries later. So, the erstwhile royal family may have been looking for a suitable replacement, with a calm natured pachyderm. Balarama fits the bill and hence was recommended, Nagaraj added.

Balarama has a record of carrying the fabled 750-kg golden howdah during Jamboo Savari, the last leg of Dasara, for a record 13 years till 2011. There was no instances of the pachyderm losing its temper, with Dasara attracting people in lakhs.
