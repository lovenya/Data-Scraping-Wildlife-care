Mohit Verma, a wildlife photographer, travels to shoot wildlife, whereas, Purushottam Panda, the doodler, travels to sketch. Their exhibition in the city over the weekend was a collection of experiences culled out from their numerous travels and treks to exotic places across the country.

ADVERTISEMENTThe exhibition ‘Shoot.Sketch’, which opened on September 5 and went on till 7, garnered a favourable response from the city’s art fraternity. Their maiden exhibition, it had on display almost 70 works of both Panda and Verma. 

“Many of the visitors wanted to discuss how tough it was to catch a blue-eyed frog in the rain forests of Agumbe. Some also wanted to know if the Pit Viper was as dangerous as it looked. We really feel that the curiosity these photographs generated, will go a long way in making the audience more aware of the 
flora and fauna of India,” said Verma.

“I am an enthusiastic wildlife photographer. I love capturing wild moments through my camera and I am an avid nature lover too. And through my photographs, I wish to promote awareness among people about the importance of protecting wildlife,” said Verma.

On the other hand, Panda’s caricatures,sketched out of deep respect for each individual has a Yo Yo Honey Singh rubbing shoulders with Dev Anand, Mary Kom looking really determined and the Dalai Lama seems to be amused with his own self. 
 
Calling himself a passionate artist, Panda also showcased many pen and ink sketches of various places like Ubud of Bali, Bijli Mahadev temple near Kasol, the dargah of Chisti from Fatehpur Sikri, etc. “I love doodling and sketching. My forte is caricatures and pen-and-ink studies of landscapes,” said Panda. Through his sketches, he hopes that beautiful places of the past will help people understand the need to preserve their environment and culture.

This unique exhibition at the India Habitat Centre was an effort by the artists to showcase art through caricatures, sketches and wildlife photographs.
