Zimbabwe has lost a total of 190 elephants due to water shortage this year, according to wildlife authorities.

ADVERTISEMENTThe country's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority said the elephants died during the dry season at the Hwange National Park, the largest in the country, Xinhua reported.
Last year, the park lost 80 elephants and 25 buffaloes as a result of high temperatures and water shortage, it said.

A single elephant can drink up to 100 litres of water at a time and up to 250 litres per day during the dry season.

Felix Chimeramombe, an official with the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, said his organisation has been engaging stakeholders to assist in resolving the water shortage. It has begun scooping water points to reduce siltation as well as improving retention capacity in the future.

A total of 25 buffaloes and five zebras also got stuck in the mud and died at Matetsi Camp while attempting to access water, he said.
