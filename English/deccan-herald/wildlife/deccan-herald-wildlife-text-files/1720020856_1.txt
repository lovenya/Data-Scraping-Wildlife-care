A job in forestry promises a ‘clean and fresh’ workplace at the least, says Richa Hegde

ADVERTISEMENTForests not only provide an opportunity to spend a lifetime admiring nature but are a vital source for human sustenance. Maintenance of forests is important for maintaining the ecological balance. Therefore, our forests need specially-trained personnel to preserve and regenerate the forest cover, wealth and resources.

Forestry is a promising career choice, creating niche avenues for those who have a spirit of adventure, a genuine interest in preserving the natural environment, and an inclination for research and analysis.

Course details

Forestry is the science of development and care of forests. Ideally, those interested must complete Class 12 or the equivalent in Science (Physics, Chemistry or Biology). Further to this, students may take up a B.Sc in Forestry, B.Sc in Wildlife, M.Sc in Forestry, M.Sc in Wildlife Biology, M.Sc in Wood Science and Technology or a Postgraduate Diploma in Forest Management. They can also pursue a doctorate after the completion of postgraduation.

Those with a Bachelor’s degree in Forest Management may appear for the Indian Forest Service Exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. The  exam is conducted every year in the month of July and the pattern is similar to that of the Civil Services exam. The selection process is carried out in three phases, wherein the candidates are sent for foundation training to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, followed by specialised orientation for the forest service at the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy.
