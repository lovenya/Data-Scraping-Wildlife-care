After ensuring that all potential hiding places and escape routes were sealed, the team carefully transferred the snake into a safe transport container.A rat snake in Chhattarpur induced panic among people when they noticed its tail sticking out of a crack in the garden wall.Another rat snake was rescued from a house in Sainik Farms.Wildlife SOS also rescued a cobra from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Pusa campus and a wolf snake from a house in Ayanagar.Wasim Akram, Deputy Director-Special Projects, Wildlife SOS, said, “The rising temperatures often force snakes out of their natural habitat to seek shelter in cooler places.”“Since they are cold-blooded animals, their body temperature varies with that of the environment. Therefore, they are unable to self-regulate their temperature if they get too warm,” he said.
