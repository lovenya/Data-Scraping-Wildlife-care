A lion-tailed macaque was electrocuted near Kudegodu in the taluk.ADVERTISEMENTThere have been a number of deaths of the macaques in the recent past. The forests, between the rivers Sharavathi and Aghanashini in the Western Ghats, are home to around 600 lion-tailed macaques.These monkeys get electrocuted when they come in contact with electricity wires while jumping from tree to tree as they have a longer and fatter body than normal monkey species, says wildlife expert Santosh. Environmentalists have favoured casing of the wires passing through the forests of the Sirsi wildlife division, like in the neighbouring Honnavar taluk.DH News Service
