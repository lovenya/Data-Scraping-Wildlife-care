The animal has been captured and kept in a mini-zoo type place in Kapilas. The upcoming rehabilitation centre can accommodate such type of animals," Upadhaya told PTI.The official said that man-elephant conflict is mostly seen in Jajpur, Dhenkanal and Khurda forest divisions and the reasons behind this phenomenon are shrinking of forest cover, increasing activities near forests and human habitation close to elephant habitats.He said as developmental activities are going to take place in future, such conflicts may also increase. Therefore, the rehabilitation centre for elephants could be a useful project, he said.The state has an estimated 2,000 elephants, he said.
