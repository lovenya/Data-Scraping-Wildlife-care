Tucked away in the hustle and bustle of Kalidasa road, The Hidden Store comes across as a pleasant surprise for those who discover it.

For, you will not only find art is available in different forms which are not so run-of-the-mill kinds here, but the pieces are also affordable, much in line with your requirement. 
Be it a traditional ‘Prabhavali’ to the theme-based modern chip tiles or even Mehandi ceramic pieces, every item here is seems exclusive. 

For those who don’t know, Prabhavali is the intricately-designed arch that forms the background of the main deity in temples or even doll arrangements.

For those who look for low maintenance knick-knacks which can be used everyday, there are light wooden chimes and key chains, painted with attractive colours and encrusted with small mirrors; beautifully designed jooties (slip ons), chip tile embedded toilet kits or traditional ‘Katte’ that holds the quintessential Tulasi (Holy Basil) plant in Hindu households etc. 

A set of four chip tiles, either available ready or made-to-order, can add a spirit of playfulness to your balcony, with its wildlife and aquatic themes.

There are wrought iron artefacts which act as candle holders. Mention must be made of designer Potlis and clutches which are well within sane price range. They are not only sassy, but also easy on the pocket. The suede bags, caudroy and cotton bags that are quite trendy and seem durable too.  

This store is also home for brand ‘Udupu’ which is created and sold here. This includes designer sarees, long and short kurtas, Vanitha Santosh, whose brain child the store is, says: “At the Hidden Store, every item is handpicked from various places or made by artisans themselves.”

What started as a small commercial venture seven years ago, has now grown into a full-time workshop and store. ‘Udupu has been known to Mysoreans since many years. We attribute major importance to quality, comfort and variety. This apart, we also cater to the section which prefers made-to-order clothes with our set of well-experienced tailors,” adds Vanitha. 

A mother of two boys, Vanitha’s fascination with colours which started with kids dresses during her days as teenager, has now taken shape of Udupu and the ‘Hidden Store’, with the encouragement from husband and relatives. 

This apart, Vanitha also designs and makes corporate uniforms to hotels, resorts and other hospitality industries. Need to know more? call 9900359172 for details.ADVERTISEMENT
