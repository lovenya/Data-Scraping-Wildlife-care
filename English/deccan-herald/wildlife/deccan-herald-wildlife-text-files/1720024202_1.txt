The High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to file counter objections in a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the proposed translocation of captive elephants to Madhya Pradesh. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe petitioner - Compassion Unlimited Plus Action - had sought to restrain the government from translocating 29 elephants to Madhya Pradesh. It had contended that the change of habitat will affect the health of elephants and they have higher chances of contracting tuberculosis.

 “A scientific study has proved that TB will be transmitted from man to elephant if there is too much of interaction between the two,” contended Uday Holla, the counsel for the petitioner.

The CUPA contended that elephants live in matriarchal society and the family will be segregated if the young ones were translocated. 

Stressing that the climate plays a key role in the survival of elephants, Holla said during summer the temperature shoots up to 49 degrees and drops down to two degrees during winter in Madhya Pradesh and the extreme temperatures will not be suitable for pachyderms.

Government counsel Kolle said though the National Board of Wildlife has given the go ahead for translocation, the matter had been put on hold. He further submitted that the elephant translocation was proposed to maintain forests and not for safari.

 He contended that translocation was not against law and the Union government had permitted it.

The Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Vikramajit Sen and Justice B V Nagarathna directed the government to file counter objections within four weeks.
