The Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) has invited tenders for submitting a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the controversial Thalaserry-Mysuru railway project. According to sources,the tender process will begin on June 30.ADVERTISEMENTThe project envisages laying rail line from Thalaserry to Mysuru via Kodagu district. However, local people and environmentalists have been opposing the project vehemently as it would destroy the flora and fauna on vast tracts of forest land. Environmentalists fear that the project may even change the course of the River Cauvery which flows in the same region. However, according to sources in South Western Railways, the rail line is being laid from Mysuru to Kushalnagar via Hunsur.The 180.46-km rail route is estimated to cost Rs 5,000 crore. Several multinational companies companies are said to have shown interest to prepare the DPR.It is said that a team of officials from Kerala conducted a secret survey in the region 20 days ago. They were found surveying a land of a private farm near Balele, when the locals took them to task and forced them to leave the place.Kodagu Wildlife Society president C P Muthanna told DH that the elected representatives should not stop by just issuing statements against the project. Lok Sabha member Prathap Simha and MLA K G Bopaiah should immediately meet Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and obtain an order against the project, he stressed.
