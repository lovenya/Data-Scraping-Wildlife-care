Iron mining in Goa will soon resume as the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest today revoked the suspension of environmental clearances (ECs) of mines in the coastal state, Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said.

ADVERTISEMENT"The MoEF today withdrew the suspension of ECs. The mining industry will resume operations immediately now," Parsekar told reporters here.

The suspension of 72 out of the total 89 approved mining leases in the coastal state had been lifted, said Parsekar, adding that the remaining ones were within the one-kilometre radius of wildlife sanctuaries.

The environmental clearances of mines had been suspended by the then Environment Minister Jayanti Natarajan in September 2012 for alleged violation of rules.

The Chief Minister also said that the state government would request the Centre to abolish export duty on the ore with low ferrous content. "We are sure that the Centre will abolish duty on low-grade ore and reduce that on high-grade ore," he said.

Currently there is uniform 30 per cent export duty on the ore.Parsekar also said that welfare schemes for those affected by suspension of mining would continue till the exports resumed.
