The subject broadly covers the study of animal physiology, treatment and prevention of diseases among animals.

Overview
The basic principles of this specialised branch of study are quite similar to that of human medical sciences. But the job profile of a veterinary doctor or a vet is much more than that of a general physician or a surgeon. It involves not only taking care of animal health but scientific breeding and handling of livestock too. 

Activities may also include animal husbandry — animal breed improvement by ‘selection breeding’ and artificial insemination, animal research to control the spread of diseases transmitted through animals, wildlife conservation, poultry management and health care, livestock insurance and rural development. A veterinary doctor has a major role in the conservation of livestock and domestic animal wealth.

The scope for veterinarians in the future is bright. As maintenence has become priority with pet owners now, the demand for private veterinary clinics is on the rise in metropolitan cities. And similarly, there has been unprecedented growth in the poultry sector and animal products’ technology sector, resulting in an increased demand for veterinarians in different sectors of livestock and poultry.

Study route
To practice as a veterinarian, it is essential to have a Bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Science (BVSc). For admission to a BVSc and Animal Husbandry course, the minimum requisite qualification is 10+2 in Physics, Chemistry and Biology (PCB). 

Selection: Admission to most veterinary colleges is on the basis of entrance examination scores, conducted by the concerned universities. Candidates are selected for a five-year BVSc & AH course on the basis of an entrance test held by the State Agriculture University at the State level, and the Veterinary Council of India. 

Fifteen per cent of the seats in every college are filled through the national-level test and the rest by the state-level test. This exam is usually held in the month of May each year. For admission to a Master’s programme, an All India Entrance Examination is conducted by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR).

Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry courses are taught in veterinary colleges which are located in almost every state. The ICAR conducts an entrance examination for 15 per cent of the total seats in state agricultural universities and seats in the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal and Central Agriculture University, Imphal.

Duration: The duration of the BVSc and AH courses varies from four-and-a-half years to five years, including the period of internship. The first four years of the training programme are devoted to imparting skills through theoretical and practical training in various disciplines, like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, nutrition, livestock management and production, production technology, pathology, microbiology, pharmacology, genetics and breeding, gynecology, surgery, medicine and animal husbandry extension, among others. The fifth year is devoted to hands-on training, of which six months will be through internship.

A Postgraduate course in Veterinary Science (M.V.Sc.) is a two-year course and the candidates have the option to specialise in areas like medicine, surgery, anatomy, bacteriology, biochemistry, cardiology, dermatology, microbiology, molecular biology, anaesthesia, gynecology, pathology, toxicology, virology pharmacology, etc. For jobs in research and teaching, a post-graduate degree in veterinary science and animal husbandry is a minimum qualification, while a PhD is preferred. 

Job prospects
Veterinary Science offers a large number of avenues of work and the demand for vets has increased tremendously. Veterinarians can choose to work with the government animal husbandry departments, poultry farms, dairy farms, sheep and rabbit farms, race clubs, stud farms, private and government veterinary hospitals and clinics. Wildlife sanctuaries and zoological parks and aviaries need veterinarians too. 

The Border Security Forces also employs veterinarians for the care and treatment of their mounted regiments which have horses, mules, camels and dogs. Army veterinarians can work as officers of the Remount Veterinary Corps. Private practice is another option they can consider. Teaching is also an option, as experienced professionals are recruited in various institutions to train the new entrants to the field. 

Besides regular practice, vets can also get into research work, either on their own or in association with the government such as the Indian Council for Agricultural Research. Pharmaceutical industries appoint veterinary scientists in their research and development divisions for the research and development of drugs, chemicals and bio-products particularly antibiotics and vaccines both for human and animal use.

 They can also work in technical sales, agribusiness, marketing, pet food manufacturing industries and in management of industries dealing with animal feed, animal products, milk and meat products processing industries etc.ADVERTISEMENT
