FOW-chee, CAW-ma-la….dah-VIN-chee?ADVERTISEMENTAmerica's preeminent infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, and its incoming vice president, Kamala Harris, join the Renaissance master himself, Leonardo da Vinci, atop this year's list of most mispronounced words, as complied by the US Captioning Company, which captions and subtitles real-time events on TV and in courtrooms.The list released on Wednesday identifies the words that proved most challenging for newsreaders and people on television to pronounce this year.The caption company said it surveyed its members to generate the list, which is now in its fifth year and was commissioned by Babbel, a language-learning app company with headquarters in Berlin and New York.Todd Ehresmann, a senior linguist at Babbel, said the list, unsurprisingly, reflects a year dominated by presidential politics and the coronavirus pandemic.“All of these have added some new phrases to our national vocabulary, which may take some practice,” he said.Here's how Ehresmann broke down the proper pronunciations for the commonly misspoken words: Anthony Fauci (AN-thon-nee FOW-chee): Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Bangtan Sonyeondan (PUNG-tahn SOH-nyun-dahn): The full name of South Korean K-Pop band 'BTS', which translates as “a group of bulletproof boys” or “bulletproof boy scouts.”Giannis Antetokounmpo (YON-nis AHN-de-doh-KOON-boh): Greek basketball player who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks and was named the NBA's 'Most Valuable Player' this year.Isias ( ees-ah-EE-ahs ): The name given to a powerful hurricane that caused significant damage to the East Coast and the Caribbean this summer.Kamala Harris (CAW-ma-la HAIR-iss): The Vice President-Elect.Leonardo da Vinci (lee-oh-NAR-doe dah-VIN-chee): The Italian painter, architect, and engineer who created the 'Mona Lisa.'
