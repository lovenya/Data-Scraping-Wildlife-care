Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said developing and underdeveloped countries are paying the price for the "wrong policies" of some developed nations, and asserted that India has raised the issue of climate justice with every such advanced country.ADVERTISEMENTIn his video message at a World Environment Day event here, Modi said for the protection of the world climate, it is important that all countries think, rising above vested interests. "For a long time, the model of development in big and advanced countries was contradictory. In this developmental model, the thinking was that we first develop our country then we can think about the environment," the prime minister said. "With this, they achieved the goals of development, but the world's environment had to pay the price for their development. Today also, the developing and underdeveloped countries of the world are paying the price for the wrong policies of some developed countries," he said.
