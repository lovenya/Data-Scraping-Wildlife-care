The PAC, it is learnt, has pointed out that there has been extensive ore extraction by violating these Acts.

The report has indicted forest department officials for not acting despite having information about these illegalities by mine owners.

Also, the forest officials were in the know of the FCA and the Wildlife Act but refused to act against the unlawful activities, it said.

"There is a direct reference to forest officials and it has been suggested that they also should be investigated," high-level sources said.

"Detailed enquiries need to be carried out to know how the lapses have occurred and how responsibility is to be fixed on erring officials of the forest department," the report said.
Sources said the PAC has recommended punitive action of exemplary nature against defaulting extractors.

The PAC report, which was submitted to the Legislative Assembly Speaker has run into controversy after Congress legislators refused to sign it.

There is uncertainty whether the Speaker would place it on the floor of the House tomorrow, the last day for the session.ADVERTISEMENT
