A meeting chaired by the principal secretary, Forest, Ecology and Environment, on July 18, decided that the present method of granting permission to private tour operators should be scrapped as it was intransparent and discriminatory.

A meeting of the State Board for Wildlife (SBW), chaired by the chief minister on August 11, also decided that private vehicles operating in different tourism zones should be phased out and the government organisations should be allowed to deploy vehicles within the carrying capacity of the park.

Accordingly, JLR said it was in a position to meet the requirement. During the SBW meeting, it was also decided that the Jungle Lodges will reserve 50 per cent of its vehicles for its own guests and the remaining vehicles for the guests of other resorts whose tour operations have been terminated.

The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests will decide the carrying capacity of sanctuaries and national parks, which will be fixed from time to time.

The resorts, including Jungle Lodges, have been directed not to expand the existing facilities to accommodate more tourists in their resorts. The Forest Departmentâ€™s decision comes in the wake of a writ petition filed by Ram, a tour operator of Water Woods Resorts, who had stated that the government was resorting to the pick-and-choose method in granting permission to tour operators in the tiger reserve.

The High Court had directed the State Forest Department to comply with the Wilderness Tourism Policy-2004 and refrain from resorting to the pick-and-choose method.
