An employee of the State Department of Technical Education, Nagendra said that the website will host 120 photos of different species of animals, birds and reptiles. 

The coffee table book, on the other hand, aims at enabling people to know about various animals.

“There are many people who haven’t even visited a forest in their lives.

The book informs about 14 sanctuaries spread across the country, animals and birds that can be found in these places, when to visit these sanctuaries, whom to contact, etc,” he said. 

In fact, Nagendra will also be exhibiting his works - Wild Witness - with the support of Unnathi Foundation at Chitrakala Parishath art complex from December 10. 

“The aim is to protect the nature in whatever way possible,” said Nagendra, who has visited at least 18 sanctuaries across India till now.ADVERTISEMENT
