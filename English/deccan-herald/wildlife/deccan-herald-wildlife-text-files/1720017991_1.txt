Speaking at a seminar on ‘Survival of forest dwellers’ organised by the People’s Movement for Human Rights at Nagarahole, he said “it is not right to evict traditional dwellers in the name of conserving environment, forest, and wildlife. Atrocity against tribals should be stopped. Just like the way fish can not be separated from sea, tribals can not be separated from the forest.” 

He said tribals have played a vital role in conserving the forest. The government should make an ernest effort to bring tribals to the mainstream of the society by providing education, health care, drinking water and electricity and other facilities.” 

The life of tribals is in distress. The facilities of the government are not reaching the tribals. 

The environmentalists are coming in the way of getting facilities for the tribals, he alleged. 

Environmentalist Suresh Heblikar said though the world has become one village with globalisation, the lives of tribals has not changed. The problems being faced by the tribals have remained the same without any solution. About 40 per cent of the population in the country are poor. The country gives priority to cricket. However, none look at tribals, he lamented. Assistant Commissioner Dr M R Ravi said “the survey on the tribals will be started after we get order from the government in Nagarahole limits. All measures will be taken to distribute title deeds to the tribals.”  The applications which was rejected under Forest Rights Act will be solved by holding an adalath, he informed. 

TP Member J K Muthamma, tribal leader Thimma shared their experiences. The traditional tribal dance attracted the attention of all.ADVERTISEMENT
