The huge demand for adventure sports among youth in the state has prompted the Karnataka government to initiate a major overhaul in this untapped arena. 

To start with, the state government is planning to make Mysuru an aerosports and aquasports hub and at the same time, is chalking out an action plan to further promote surfing along the coastal line.

More thrills are in store for the adventurous with several rock-climbing destinations across the state being identified. A slew of adventure sports competitions are also being lined up. “We have already declared 2017 as the Year of the Wild to promote wildlife in Karnataka. In tune with this, the tourism department has tied up with the department of sports and youth affairs to promote adventure sports in a big way,” Tourism Minister Priyank Kharge told DH.

While private clubs do offer several adventure sports options, the government now plans to take a deeper plunge in this sector. The long pending proposal for an aquasportscentre at Varuna lake located on the outskirts of Mysuru will soon take shape with Rs 5 crore being released for the project.

The government will also apply with the Airport Authoritys of India and Ministry of Civil Aviation to promote aerosports like skydiving, parasailing at Mandakalli airport in Mysuru. 
As a part of the plan to promote Karnataka coastline as an international surfing destination, the annual surfing festival at Sasihitlu beach, Mangaluru will be scaled up next year. “We had 40,000 footfalls at the beach earlier this year. We plan to take it forward at the next festival scheduled for June 2018,” Kharge said.

 Come November, Nandi Hills, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, will be host to its own adventure festival. Rock climbing, nature walks, triathlon trails are being planned as part of the festival.
The state government, in association with General Thimayya National Academy of Adventure (Gethnaa) will host several adventure festivals in the coming months. These include Badami Rock Festival (Oct 27-29); Para Climbing Cup (Dec 3-4); Udupi Adventure Festival (Dec 16-17), Yadgir Adventure Festival (Jan 6-7, 2018), Avathi Bouldering Festival (Jan 20-11, 2018) among others.
