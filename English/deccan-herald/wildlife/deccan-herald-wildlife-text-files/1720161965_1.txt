The man-eater tiger at Mudugai in Khanapura taluk in Belagavi should be shot as a last resort, said Tiger and wildlife expert Dr K Ullas Karanth. 

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to Deccan Herald, he said “we had suggested the authorities not to release the tiger that was caught in Chikkamagaluru to Khanapura forest in Belagavi. 

However, our suggestions were turned down. Now, the problem has been aggravated in Khanapura. A few had misled the forest department officials,” he lamented. 

“It is not right to blame the forest department. Those who  had suggested the forest department of releasing the tiger in Khanapura forest should be held responsible. 

Tiger eating a cow was captured in camera trapping. Inspite of collar ID, the radio tracking could not be captured.  Is it right to play on the lives of human being,” he asked. 

“People will not get any solution if police and forest department officials are attacked. People should be cautious and help the forest department in capturing man-eater tiger.” 

Karanth said protection of tiger is a technical issue. Those who give suggestions to the forest department should have had conducted research on tiger and should have knowledge on tiger. Wildlife Board has a few members who have no knowledge on wildlife. 

He flayed the move of the wildlife board members Rana George and wildlife expert Sanjay Gubbi for clicking a photograph of tiger after its capture in Chikkamagaluru recently.  “Karnataka is successful in the conservation of tiger. There are 350 to 400 tigers in the state, which is a good development. A project will not be successful without the support of the people. After the forest dwellers of Bhadra reserve forest were rehabilitated, the tiger population has doubled,” he said.
