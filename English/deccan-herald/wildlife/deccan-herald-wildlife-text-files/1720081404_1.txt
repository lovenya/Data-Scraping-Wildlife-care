That will be the situation in the next ten years,” Reddy said.He added that there is immense scope for the tourism sector in India’s northeast region, but there has not been sufficient private investment. Reddy added that without private investment, tourism in any country cannot be developed and moved forward.With India currently presiding over G20, Reddy said that more than 100 meetings under the presidency of the grouping have been conducted across the length and breadth of the country, providing an opportunity for delegates and officials from the G20 nations to witness and experience the rich cultural heritage and tourism landmarks of India.The minister said that under its G20 Presidency and from tourism's point of view, India has focussed and prioritised a sustainable and inclusive future for all, technological transformation, digital public infrastructure, multilateral institutions for the 21st century as well as women-led development.Reddy said India’s tourism and hospitality industry is one of the largest industries and one of the largest employment-generating sectors in the country.He said in the tourism sector, the Government of India has adopted a whole-of-government approach, and various ministries, including External Affairs and Civil Aviation, are working together in this regard.He noted that the world is facing various challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and countries in India’s neighbourhood and others around the globe facing turmoil and financial crisis.However, Reddy said India has shown stability and growth even in these challenging times.Radha Katyal Narang, Director (G20), Ministry of Tourism, gave a detailed presentation on the tourism industry in India at the event.
