The Apex Court has already rejected several attempts to seek a review of the  judgment of October 30, 2002. It rejected the Review Application on November 29, 2005. Even on December 15, 2005 the SC dismissed a Curative Petition (the last legal option) seeking continuation of mining. It is truly shocking that the Government is still attempting to support KIOCL’s mining even after the legal process has reached finality," said Praveen Bhargav, Member, National Board of Wildlife and Trustee Wildlife First, on whose petition the closure of KIOCL was ordered by the SC. 

Niren Jain of Kudremukh Wildlife Foundation said the KIOCL continues to be in possession of lapsed lease area without any legal rights. “The company is floating new proposals to hang on to public lands within the limits of a fully notified National Park," he said.ADVERTISEMENT
