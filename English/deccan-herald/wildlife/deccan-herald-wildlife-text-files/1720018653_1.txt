It was an enlightening experience for youngsters as a short documentary called ‘When Things Go Wrong’ was screened on the first day.

This was a movie on teen suicide made by the students of journalism and was released by Sakuntala Samuelson, the principal of MSRCASC. The cast and crew members of the film also shared their opinion about the making of the film. 

On the second day, a fun-filled photography competition-cum-exhibition was organised by the department of journalism in association with the environmental science department. With the theme ‘Nature and Wildlife’, the exhibition was attended by S M Acharya, Chief Executive, M S Ramaiah Institutions.

Well-known photographers, editors and short film-makers Vishwesh Shivaprasad and Madan Ramvenkatesh, judged the competition and even conducted a photography workshop for the students.

With over 150 entries depicting the beautiful theme of nature and its intricate patterns, in the end, it was Chethan from final year B Com who won the first prize. His photograph consisted of a beautiful tree in the middle of a tea estate. “I had taken this picture on a trip to North India and am happy to have won the show. The competition gave a good platform to all the participants,” he said. 

Preethi from first year BCA won the second prize while the third prize was shared by Ramya and Abhishek Yadav. “Apart from Bangalore, I generally click pictures in places like Munnar, Madikeri and Nagarhole. However, this photo was shot at Sankey Tank early in the morning.

This photo of mine consisted of Russian ducks, a rare species of birds, that migrate during the April and May and can be shot only early morning or after sunset,” said Preethi. “I still can’t believe I got the second prize,” she added. 

Said Radhika, a lecturer in journalism, organiser of the event, “The short film ‘When Things Go Wrong’ was actually not a part of the syllabus. But we still made it to give students a practical exposure in the field of media and various aspects of it like production and voice-over.”

She added, “The movie was shot in Sadashivnagar and featured the students of journalism both on camera and off it.” The team now plans to showcase the movie at various college and short film festivals.
