The ground fire burnt only dry grass and leaves.  Some miscreants, with an intention to carry out “irregularities”, had set fire. Efforts are on to identify them, he said. 

In Chamundi hills, grass in four acres had been burnt. Neither trees nor animals were affected. The reasons for fire are yet to be established.  In Biligiriranganathittu hills, miscreants had set fire in 12 places. Grass and other plants in 250 acres had been destroyed, but no ‘important’ wild animals died. Similarly, in the Punajanur wildlife range, the fire was spread across four acres. Here too miscreants were responsible for the fire, the minister said.  

Raising the issue, H S Mahadev Prasad (Cong) said forest fires had become a recurring problem. Shortage of field staff in the Forest Department is posing problem to take precautionary measures, he alleged.
