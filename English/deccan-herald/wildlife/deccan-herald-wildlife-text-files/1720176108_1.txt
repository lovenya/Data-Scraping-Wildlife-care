A resident of Mandi in Himachal Pradesh (HP) directly called up the state chief minister Jai Ram Thakur way past midnight in distress after a super-sized Cobra snake entered his house.ADVERTISEMENTThe man got a wimp of some creepy movement inside his house at the odd hour. He got up and what he saw inside left him and his family in a state of utter panic. The Mandi native, Nipun Malhotra, called up the state forest and wildlife department for help, but to no avail. He claims the call to the department that night was not responded.Malhotra then called up the chief minister who was quick to respond. The CM assured immediate help. He called up the Mandi deputy commissioner asking him to respond on priority to help the family in distress. The deputy commissioner quickly coordinated and sent a snake charmer to Malhotraâ€™s house. The charmer laid a trap and caught the snake much to the relief of the panicked family.The Malhotra family, which according to sources, is known to Jai Ram Thakur, says it is indebted to CM for not only picking up the mobile phone call in the middle of the night but also for responding swiftly to help them. Thakur is a first-time chief minister. His wife has roots in Karnataka.
