It is said that the lion’s footfall results in the growth of that place. In Indian history and mythology, the lion is given a special place. It symbolizes strength, courage, and leadership, and thus it is also said to be the Vahana (vehicle) of Goddess of power, Maa Durga. In Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has termed himself as Mrigraj. At the same time, the throne of King is called SINHANSAN, and the National Emblem of India, the Ashok Stambh, is also a pillar with four Asiatic Lions. Thus, Mr. Nathwani has been working for the protection of such a rare and precious species for the past 35 years.“I feel that lions are not just animals; they are my family! I love them. It’s my duty to protect, promote and conserve lions and gir forests as much as I can. Watching lions makes me recharged” says Parimal Nathwani, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) & Director Corporate Affairs, RILThe wildlife conservation enthusiast and Rajya Sabha members’ journey began when there were no transportation facilities available in the Gir region.
