Kangaroo Island in South Australia is home to a wide variety of Australian native wildlife. Susheela nair offers a sneak peek into this untouched natural beauty.

 I wish I could spend a minimum of seven days traversing the rolling farm lands, untouched national parks, tiny country towns, fishing hamlets, deserted sandy coves, towering sand dunes, and spectacular landscapes in this diverse island. 

But I had just a day to indulge in koala spotting, to watch sea-lions bask on snow white beaches and the kangaroos hop around unconcernedly.

 I had a fleeting glimpse of Vivonne Beach, rated the best beach in Australia and some memorable moments at Kangaroo Island’s biggest draw: Remarkable Rocks and Admirals Arch.

This wild island has some intriguing tales to share. It is believed that aboriginal people lived on this island several years ago. Traces of their dwellings can still be seen in caves in the cliff sides around Cape du Couedic, as well as other parts of the island. Why they abandoned this wild island and how they left is shrouded in mystery. 

Intriguingly, mainlanders called it ‘Karta’ or ‘Land of the Dead’. When Captain Mathew Flinders chanced upon the island in 1802, he and his crew were starving to death. Not able to curb their hunger pangs, they killed 31 tame kangaroos and stewed them down into soup for dinner. In honour of the feast, he named the place Kangaroo Island.

Separated from the Australian mainland some 9,000 years ago, about one-third of Kangaroo Island (KI) is declared a National or Conservation Park. KI is a veritable Noah’s Ark of Australian wildlife with 267 species of birds, 891 species of native plants and Liguerian bees, found nowhere else on the planet.

 Kangaroos and koala bears far outnumber the Island’s 4,400 permanent residents. Thankfully, the paucity of water and poor soil on Kangaroo Island has kept the population low and made it easier for conservationists to protect the island. With the wool industry taking a back seat, tourism gained prominence. Currently, Kangaroo Island is an excellent example of how tourism and conservation can work in unison.

Animal watch

From our resort in Kingscote, our ebullient guide, Gaylene Booth drove us to Seal Bay Conservation Park in a 4WD. A pleasant stroll along a broad boardwalk brought us to the beach lined with lolling sea lions and their pups. We tarried awhile at the lookouts and viewing platforms to have stunning views of coastal headlands. 

As we strolled down to the beach, their excited bleats, growling and barking drew us to the mesmerising circus in the sea lion colony. It was a treat to watch young sea-lion pups frolic in the surf and learn to swim, and mothers nurture their young ones along the beach front. 

Some of the adults lay sprawled across the sand like logs of wood after digesting a two-day feed of fish. I was amused to see them sitting upright, resting on their flippers, occasionally raising their necks skyward in a yogic pose and flopping down again the next minute.

From there we moved on to Hanson Bay Wildlife Sanctuary on the western side of the island. It houses an amazing variety of feathered and four-footed residents. Here we watched koalas snoozing in lofty eucalyptus trees and kangaroos hopping around with their joeys in their pouches. 

These laid-back koalas have a voracious appetite for vegetation and need 19 hours of sleep. We came across a host of other native animals like tammar wallabies, possums, heath goanna, echidna, etc. We spotted some noisy magpies, blue wrens, rosellas, lorikeets, pelicans and galahs, but not the rare glossy black cockatoo, an endangered species found only on KI. 

At the Flinders Chase National Park Visitor Centre, we saw life-size murals of giant mega fauna and interesting displays on the island’s flora and fauna.

The visit to the Remarkable Rocks and Admirals Arch — two of the island’s most popular landmarks — left us gaping in wonder. Along the rugged southern coastline at Cape Du Couedic is Admiral’s Arch, an impressive archway sculpted by the wind and sea.

 It’s a pleasant walk along a long wooden pathway and up a few staircases that hug the cliff face, where we saw native New Zealand fur seals. They are everywhere, basking on sun-drenched jagged rocks and slithering into the swirling rock pools.

From Admirals Arch, we were whisked to Remarkable Rocks on Kirkpatrick Point just a 10-minute drive away. It is a series of bizarre granite boulders precariously perched atop a massive, granite dome rising 70 feet from the pounding surf. 

A favourite haunt of tourists, filmmakers and photographers, many films, fashion shoots and magazine covers have been shot here, including the Kingfisher Calendar. At twilight, the rust-coloured surfaces reddened, casting a glow on the surreal stones stranded on a bleak headland overlooking Sanderson’s Bay. 

I stood spellbound savouring the dreamlike scene. Though the allotted time had run out, I wished I could tarry a little longer, but Gaylene prodded me to move on to the next site. 

At Kingscote, I witnessed an equally fascinating sight: penguins, sea gulls and pelicans sharing space on the waterfront and swooping down to the wharf for a frenetic feed of fish. It was a befitting finale to our wild sojourn.
