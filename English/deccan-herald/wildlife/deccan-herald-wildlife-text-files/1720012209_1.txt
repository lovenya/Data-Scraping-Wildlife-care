Aithal, who plays an important role in conservation of snakes, especially the endangered species, has perhaps lost count of the number of snakes he has rescued while attending snake distress calls. Hundreds of snakes, if not thousands, have found rebirth because this doctor of snakes treats injured snakes and translocates them to the nearby forested area. 

Just like the way he has treated snakes, he has cured thousands of people with his Ayurvedic medicine. Aithal inherited this medical knowledge from his mother and grandfather. In fact, Dr Aithal is a well-known expert in the field of research and conservation of snakes, and the most sought-after doctor when it comes to snake bites.
It is a delight to watch his live specimen home Bana (earlier known as Sarpa Loka) with over 20 species of snakes (mostly pairs) including the King Cobra, Common Krait, Pit Viper, Russell’s Viper, Saw Scaled Viper, Bamboo Pit Viper and non-poisonous snakes like Common Worm Snake, Python, Brown Sand Boa, Stripped Kneel Back and Branded Racer, Flying Snake, Wolf Snake, Bronz Back Tree Snake among others.

Rebirth to over 100 snakes this week alone!
Speaking to Deccan Herald, Dr Aithal said this week alone, he released over 100 snakes in the reserve forest area. “A person from Venur brought 15 python eggs which he found near his home. A few days later, another person from Budodi said there were 15 python eggs in his property which I brought home. Yet another person from Sentyar, while cleaning his property, found 33 python eggs out of which 18 were damaged.”
The doctor has been successful in breeding 48 pythons by using natural methods (instead of using artificial incubators) such as a wooden box. “The female python incubates for about 50 to 60 days without taking any food or water. But if it is disturbed, it simply moves from the place and won’t return,” informs Dr Aithal and adds, “Once it completes its incubation period and the moment the babies come out, then too, the python leaves its babies and goes away.”

In the same week, a Russel’s Viper in Bana too gave birth to 52 babies. 
The doctor had a surprise because in the next week, 10 young ones of the Lizard Monitor too came out of their shells with the help of the natural incubation method used by Dr Aithal. Interestingly, the person from Panaje near Puttur who handed over the 10 eggs of Lizard Monitor, gave it to the Snake Doctor thinking that they belonged to a cobra.
All the 110 babies have been released into the reserve forest area this week. Aithal who originally hails from Saligrama in Udupi made Puttur his home 25 years ago when he moved there as a bank employee. Also a certified homeopath, Dr Aithal quit his job after serving in a co-operative bank in Puttur for five years and started practising Ayurveda. 
Dr Aithal’s daughters follow in his footsteps. Hasta Aithal and Krithika Aithal too play with snakes, the way other kids of their age play with toys.

“It is sad that a majority of the people have an undue fear about snakes and kill these cold-blooded animals,” regrets Dr Aithal, who is on a mission to create awareness among people. A brief discussion with Dr Aithal and a visit to his Sarpa Loka, now renamed Bana (Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre) will surely change any person’s perception of snakes.ADVERTISEMENT
