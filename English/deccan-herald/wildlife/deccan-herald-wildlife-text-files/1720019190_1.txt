However, Prof B M Kumaraswamy, a member of the Western Ghat Task Force, agrees with the Government’s views on the issue. He told Deccan Herald that the Unesco’s world heritage status would convert the sites into ‘No-Go Area’. The local government will lose control over them. 

Besides, all these sites are not just forest areas without people. The world heritage tag might compel tribal people and villagers residing in the areas close to the sites to vacate their dwelling places.ADVERTISEMENT
