The Save Kodagu awareness bike jatha reached Madikeri on Saturday. 

ADVERTISEMENTIt was organised by the Kodava Samaja, Madikeri, Mysuru, Bengaluru, Wildlife Society and Bengaluru Kodavaame. The Jatha from Kodagu had left for Bengaluru to create awareness on environment conservation, a few days ago. 

Speaking on the occasion, Kaveri Sene leader K A Ravi Changappa said that the Union government has earmarked funds for the laying of a railway line to Kushalnagar. “The laying of a railway line will result in the felling of thousands of trees. This, in turn, will affect the district,” the leader pointed out.

He said thousands of trees were felled to implement the 400 kv high tension line from Kaiga to Kozhikode. “At the same time, huge ‘balanji,’ mango, ‘kaadu bevu’ and other trees were axed illegally. The felling of trees will have direct affect on the water sources of the district,” he said.
Bengaluru Kodavaame leader Roshan Somanna also spoke.

A memorandum to save Kodagu was submitted to wildlife division Assistant Conservator of Forest P A Seema and Deputy Commissioner Meer Anees Ahmmed to be forwarded to State and Central governments.
