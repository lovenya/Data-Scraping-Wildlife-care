To prevent the destruction of forests and wildlife of Bandipur National Park, owing to forest fires, forest department has set up fire lines around the park. The fire lines will help in controlling any accidental forest fire in the reserve forest.

Forest fires in several parts of the national park in 2012 had caused large scale destruction of the flora and fauna. Soaring mercury levels has also increased the chances of forest fires in the region.  As a precautionary measure fire line of 2100 kilometres is set up around the park.

As many as 380 permanent staff along with an additional 350 watchmen employed as daily wage labourers are posted in various part of the reserve forest to detect forest fires and prevent it from spreading.ADVERTISEMENT“Setting up of fire lines in the park is complete. We are ready to control the fire in any part of the reserve forest. To review the steps taken at the national park, officials from Tiger Conservation Authority will visit the park. Additional safety measures will be taken after their visit,” said director and conservator of forests of Bandipur National Park, H C Kantaraju.

Causes
Forest fires are both natural and artificial. Fire can be caught due to friction between bamboo canes or fire can be intentionally started by man. Irresponsible tourists are also known to set fires in the forest, which escalates to a forest fire in a short span of time, especially during dry seasons.

However, the forest department is considering all such accidents that may result in a forest fire, to prevent forest fires in the national park.
