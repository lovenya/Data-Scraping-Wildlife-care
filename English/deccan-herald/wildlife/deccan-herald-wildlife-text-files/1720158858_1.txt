The State government will launch operations to shift 30 elephants responsible for extensive crop damages in Alur taluk in January, said Forest Minister Ramanath Rai here on Tuesday.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing a press meet, he said that the captured elephants will be sent to elephant camps in the State, as the elephants would return to the same place, if they are caught and re-located to other forests.

Following the implementation of Wildlife Conservation Act, the numbers of wild animals have risen. A few years ago, the number of elephants in the State was only 3,000, which has grown to 6,000 today. Due to encroachment of forest land, the wild elephants are venturing into areas of human habitation. To solve this problem, the State government has earmarked Rs 30 crore to build elephant trenches, he said.

“Solar fencing to prevent elephants has been futile. We are other exploring other options of creating fences,” he said.

Speaking on the proposed elephant corridor, he said that government has given in principle consent to the project. “We have held discussions with elected representatives of the concerned region. Discussions on land acquisition for the project will be held soon. We will demand for funds from the Center under 14th Finance Commission,” he said.
