A homemaker from Bengaluru has created a record of sorts by winning the gold medal in the recently-concluded FIAP (The International Federation of Photographic Art) contest organised by the Youth Photographic Society. ADVERTISEMENTPrema Kakade, who took to photography just four years ago, is the first homemaker to win the gold medal since the society was set up in 1971. For Prema, what started off as a backyard shoot during her free time has now turned into a passion. Some of her pictures have turned out to be the best of the best. Speaking to DH, she said she developed an interest in painting which later prompted her to take up photography. That’s where she eventually saw the extension of the art form in photography. “Right in my backyard, I could see birds and squirrels whose videos I recorded regularly. My husband and son encouraged me to get into photography,” she said. Prema likes to capture wildlife, landscapes and does creative (pictorial) photography. She believes that being able to show the beauty of nature’s creation is what makes her pictures unique. She has extensively shot all over India, including in prominent forests like Bandipur, Bharatpur and several hill stations. An exhibition of all the award-winning images began at Chitrakala Parishath, Kumara Krupa Road, on Friday and will go on until August 19, which is World Photography Day. Senior photographers would be honoured that day. Another FIAP gold medallist, Nikhil Bhaktavatsala, said the love towards nature, wildlife and travelling prompted him to take up photography. “Wildlife is my first preference because my first love is wildlife and nature, after which comes photography. I look at rare species and travelling to less-explored places,” he adds.
