A new tiger cub has been sighted at the Ranthambore National Park. The cub, according to experts, must be two or three months old and was seen following its mother (T-39) in Sultanpur forest block of the national park. 

ADVERTISEMENTNow, the total count of tiger cubs in the park has reached 21.

According to sources, the cub was seen following its mother in the morning by Balendu Singh, honorary warden at the national park.

Forest department officials had been hoping that T-39 would provide a litter for the park. The sighting of the tigress suggests that she has already given birth. The cub was seen with its mother as she came out from a bush, where they were hiding.

 Y K Sahoo, park’s field director, said, “Yes, T-39 was spotted with a cub.” There is also a possibility of a second cub as tigresses are known to give birth to two cubs.

“The tigress and her cub were sighted at 6:30 am on Monday, when after a drink from a waterhole, they climbed a hill and disappeared into the forest. There are now 23 tiger cubs in the park. However, this also raises concern among experts, as in the near future the cubs will need to establish their own territory. 

There is a need to link forest areas like Ramgarh-Vishdhari in Bundi and sanctuaries in Karauli district with corridors so thatthe spillover population of the park can reside in these protected areas,” said Singh.

The total number of tigers in the park has now gone up to 47, including 26 adults - 12 males and 14 females - and 21 cubs, according to the wildlife authorities at the Ranthambore National Park.
