Failing to get a permanent post in the Forest Department, sources say that disappointment compelled the guard to end his life. 

Seena Naik (42), a native of Kanagondanahalli of Kadur taluk is the deceased. He is survived by his wife Lolakshi Bai and two daughters Nandini and Archana. 

He has been working in Mutthodi and Siravase region over the last 22 years on daily wage basis and was residing at Embarahalli. 

Following Seena Naikâ€™s death, the daily wage workers expressed anguish over the Forest Department for not recruiting low level workers as permanent staff, thus compelling them to lead an insecure life. They daily wage workers have kept the dead body in front of the office of the Bhadra Wildlife Division and have begun staging overnight protest urging to meet their demands. 

Their demands include permanent post to the wife of deceased in the coffee estate and offer jobs to the children of the deceased in the Forest Department. They have said that they would not leave the till their demands are met. 

The protestors said that the Forest Department is showing no concern to the employees despite having received a circular from the Government stating to consider the matter pertaining to offer permanent posts to the staff. There is no security to the daily wage labourers in the State. Talks with the officers have gone futile, said one of the protestors. They have warned of committing mass suicide if they fail to receive assurance regarding the permanent posts. 

Conservator of Forest Avathar Singh, Deputy Conservator of Forest Venkatesh and RFO Jaya Kumar and others attempt to soothe the protestors was in vain. Tight police security is in place to avoid any untoward incident.
