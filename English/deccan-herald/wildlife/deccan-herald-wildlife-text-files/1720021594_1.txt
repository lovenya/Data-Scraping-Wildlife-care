Obsessed with revenge

As a young boy, Bruce Wayne watched in horror as his millionaire parents were killed in front of him — a trauma that led him to become obsessed with revenge. 

After fleeing to the East, Bruce returns to his now decaying Gotham City, which is overrun by organised crime and other dangerous individuals, to find a cave under his mansion, along with a prototype armoured suit. 

This discovery leads him to assume a new persona, one which will strike fear into the hearts of men who do wrong — Batman.
