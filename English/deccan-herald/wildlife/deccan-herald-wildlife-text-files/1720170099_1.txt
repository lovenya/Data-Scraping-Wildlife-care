Just when it appeared like another court hearing, the Chandigarh police in a dramatic way pulled out two snakes of the endangered sand boa species before a local Judge in an open courtroom on Monday. This, to testify that the two reptiles were alive and in safe custody.

Snakes of the sand boa species are estimated to be valued in excess of a crore of rupees in the international market. Their price varies depending upon their weight and some other factors. The snakes were recovered from two persons who were trying to smuggle them to potential buyers. The Chandigarh police did not want to take any chances after it learnt that the snake species was an endangered one and fetches a whopping price.

So, in less than two hours after the police managed to rescue the snakes from the smugglers, it deemed it appropriate to produce the snakes before the judge. The snakes were ‘case property’, but one which could not be retrieved at a later stage during the trial.

Carefully, the sand boa snakes were pulled out of a bag and showed to the judge. After the drill, the judge ordered forest and wildlife officials to release the snakes in the forest. In fact, the police did not have a cue of the rarity of this reptile species until the officials of the wildlife wing were asked to pitch in. It was only thereafter that the cops got a whiff of what they had chanced upon.

For the police it was a routine evening check-naka when the cops on duty asked two youth, both under 20 years of age, to stop for checking.

They attempted to flee, but were nabbed. Inside the bag they were carrying were two sand boa snakes.

Sources said, these snakes are smuggled to faraway places in Nepal for sale in South East Asian and even some western countries. This species is used for making medicines and other products.ADVERTISEMENT
