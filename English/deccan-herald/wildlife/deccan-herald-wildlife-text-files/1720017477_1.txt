I am on a trip to explore Dooars, which does not find its place in a regular tourist’s itinerary. The Dooars Valley, stretching from River Teesta on the west to River Sankosh on the east, is an area covering roughly 130 km by 40 km that forms a major part of the Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal. Here, you will not find a single touristy stall selling souvenirs or an eatery dishing out multi-cuisine dishes at a rapid pace. What it boasts of is water streams, chirping birds and a green belt stretching as far as your eyes can see.  

My drive starts in the Himalayan foothills from Siliguri to Dooars. The various signages on the way explain the fact that I can actually go to Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sikkim and Guwahati from here. Dooars is a gateway to many worlds in the northeast. My driver, Amal, suggests that we stop at the Kalu Rinpoche Monastery at Salugara on the way and the famous Coronation Bridge over the mighty Teesta River. The road ahead passes through a tea garden belt and lush green forests via Oodlabari and Malbazar to reach Chalsa in Dooars.

The entire drive is a treasure trove for travellers who love to explore different species of plants and trees. The sheer size of the ferns, the majestic height of bamboo trees, trees loaded with grape fruits and the quintessential tea gardens, form the topography of the drive. The very essence of Dooars is its rich wildlife and exquisite flora and fauna, which can be experienced through its reserve forests located nearby. The region is also famous for its lush tea gardens and is ideal for trekking, white water rafting and bird watching. 

Go for an early morning safari to the Gorumara National Park and be on the look out for one-horned rhinoceros, elephants, bisons, leopards, deer, turtles, pythons and monkeys, as well as 200 species of birds. Located on the banks of Murti and Raidak rivers, the forest abounds in natural beauty. The other places to visit are — Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary, Buxa Tiger Reserve and the Jaldapara Sanctuary. It is said that the Buxa Tiger Reserve has the second-highest tiger population in West Bengal, after Sunderbans. If you are lucky, you can also sight elephants, bisons, leopards and deer. The Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, situated on the banks of Torsa River, boasts of a medley of woods, grasslands, swamps and streams. The Chapramari Forest consists of a canopy of large trees like teak, sal, bahera, kawla, dilenia, mallotus, chilaune and lali, as well as 83 types of grass, including the giant elephant grass.

In these sanctuaries, the vast texture of massive trees sheltering varieties of orchids and the forests resounded with songs of birds and calls of wild animals, make it a veritable paradise for nature lovers  and eco-tourism. Samsing is the range office of the Neora Valley National Park. The drive to Samsing is a pleasure trip along a meandering emerald green river, the cool shades of orange orchards, sleepy hamlets, picturesque tea gardens and the lofty Himalayas. If you have an unending appetite for nature, then you could also add the Kalijhora forest, Lava Forest Village and the small village, Bindu, to your itinerary. My visit to Soongachi Tea Estate was interesting where I learnt about the different stages of tea processing. The many tales from locals about the regular visits of wild elephants in the vicinity of the estate made my visit even more exciting.  

The best place to have evening tea is Murti River Bank. The experience of being amidst peaceful environs, having a cup of tea as you watch the sun go down, is nothing but memorable.

* How to get there: Direct flights from Kolkata/Delhi to Bagdogra are available. On reaching Bagdogra, take a two-hour drive to reach Chalsa in Dooars.

* Best time to visit: Dooars can be visited any time of the year. Even in the warmer months, mornings and evenings are cool as the region is lush green. My favourite time is during the monsoons when the rivers and waterfalls are gushing with water and trees are glistening with rain drops.
