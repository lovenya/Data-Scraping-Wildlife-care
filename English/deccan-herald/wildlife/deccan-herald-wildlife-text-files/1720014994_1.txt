Addressing a press conference after a regional-level review meeting of tourism projects he said Kingfisher and Jet Airways evinced interest to run chartered flights, as the State has offered tax exemption to the tune of 4 per cent. 

“Chairman of Air India Aravind Jadav has assured the State government that technical hitches in starting regular flight operations from Mysore will be cleared soon. We will be happy if it is overcome before Dasara,” he said. 

Heli-tourism

Reddy said his department had divided the tourism destinations into four circuits, namely Heritage circuit, Pilgrim circuit, Malnad circuit and Coastal circuit. The heritage circuit which comprises Hampi, Pattadakal, Badami, Aihole and Bijapur will begin operations in October. 
Tourism infrastructure in Udupi will be upgraded, Reddy said, adding that his department would install a 125-ft Lord Krishna’s statue at St Mary’s island on the lines of Eshwara statue in Murudeshwara. 

Jumbos arrive

The elephants taking part in the dasara celebrations began their second leg of the Mysore tour after receiving a grand welcome at the Mysore palace here on Monday. 

The jumbos Balarama, Abhimanyu, Varalakshmi, Gajendra, Arjuna, Sarala were accorded a colourful reception and offered jaggery and sugarcane. District In-charge Minister Suresh Kumar and Tourism Minister G Janardhana Reddy showered flower petals followed by a guard of honour given by the Palace police to the elephants. He told reporters that all preparations for the Naada Habba will be completed in time. 

Deputy Conservator of Forests (Mysore Wildlife Division) Yathish Kumar said Balarama was fit enough to carry the golden howdah for the 12th successive year. 

“We hope that he would give a better performance next year as well”, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
