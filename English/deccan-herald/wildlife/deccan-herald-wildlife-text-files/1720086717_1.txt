Yesterday, hundreds of people walked through the area where his body was found. But today, we can see its pug marks. As neighbours, our demand is to shoot and kill this man-eater tiger," a local resident told a TV channel.As Prajeesh did not return even after several hours on Saturday, his brother went searching for him and found the body in a nearby forest.Meanwhile, a senior forest official told PTI that there are three tigers in the locality as per their reports."Currently, we need to identify the tiger which attacked the man. All we have is a blurry photo. Steps will be taken according to the order," the official said.Earlier this year, a 50-year-old man lost his life in a tiger attack.In August 2017, the Kerala government informed the assembly that according to a tiger census conducted at the Periyar and Parambikulam Tiger Reserves in the state, there was a confirmed presence of 58 big cats in these reserves in 2016.
