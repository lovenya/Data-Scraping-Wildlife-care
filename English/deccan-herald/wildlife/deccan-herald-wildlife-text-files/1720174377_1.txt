Nepal’s police on Monday sent a four-member team headed by deputy superintendent of police Ravi Raj Khadka to Tiger Tops, an upmarket wildlife resort in Chitwan in southern Nepal, to look into the altercation on Saturday during which Paras himself admitted to having fired a round of bullets.

The belated probe was ordered after Nepal’s media on Monday reported Paras letting fly with his Colt after an altercation with Rubel Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi national married to Melanie, daughter of Nepal’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sujata Koirala, and his companion, an Indian employed at a five-star hotel in the capital.ADVERTISEMENT
