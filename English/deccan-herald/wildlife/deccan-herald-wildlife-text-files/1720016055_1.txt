The website, being developed by a group of wildlife enthusiasts group ‘ Green Matrix’ from the City, will have complete details of all the eight zoos in the State. As animal  adoption is becoming more popular with involvement of celebrities such as cricketers, film stars and politicians, Green Matrix now has come out with a plan to attract the animal lovers towards adoption.

Explaining the need for animal adoption in a big way, M N Jayakumar, Additional Principal Conservator of Forest and Member Secretary, ZAK says: “Adoption develops an emotional linkage between man and animal and boosts strong bonding. By adopting an animal, a person will have a sense of belonging.”

The ZAK has decided to revise the adoption tariff to make more people adopt animals so that not just celebrities, even the common man too can join the programme. “ These animals have been categorised into fifteen sections. Under this, birds and small animals are in the lowest category (one- five) and the bigger mammals such as elephants and tigers are categorised as highest (eleven to fifteen),” explained Jayakumar.

The ZAK is planning to relook into the feeding cost to enable more people adopt animals. “ This should not be the domain of a few rich people. For instance if an elephant costs Rs 1.75 lakh per annum, we are planning to split the cost by working out the cost for a month or even for a week,” he explained.  

First in the Country

Karnataka has been the first state in the country to introduce animal adoption. Mysore’s Chamarajendra zoo had emerged as the first in the country to begin an adoption programme way back in the early 2000s.

During the year 2008-09, the zoo recorded 226 adoptions earning Rs 36.4 lakh. In the period 2009-2010 and 2010 (October), 273 and 281 cases of adoption have been recorded in the zoo earning Rs 22.16 lakh and Rs 24.96 lakh, respectively.

At Bannerghatta

During the year 2008-2009, the park earned a sum of Rs 12.16 lakh through adoption. The earnings are Rs 17.38 lakh and Rs 10.95 lakh, respectively, for the year 2009-2010 and 2010 (up to October 2010).
