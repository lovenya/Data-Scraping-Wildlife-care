With more than 65% polling recorded on  Wednesday, SP leaders claimed that their alliance has managed to hold on  to Muslims against the strong fear of poaching by BSP in the second  phase.

ADVERTISEMENTThis phase witnessed communal polarisation in Bijnor district due to the recent murder of a teenager in Nayagaon village.

BJP  leaders, however, claimed the battle in this leg of election in 67  constituencies spread over 11 districts was with the SP-Congress  alliance and enthusiastic polling was an indication of the sharp  Hindu-Muslim divide in minority-dominated seats of Saharanpur and  Bijnor. Interestingly, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday tweeted  that Mayawati will come up with a surprise result in UP as Donald Trump  did in the US, but later clarified that it was an error and he actually  wanted to say that NaMo will excel instead of Mayawati.

BJP  sources claimed that communal polarisation took place in eight seats in  Bijnor due to the killing of a teenager that led to Hindu-Muslim divide a  couple of days ahead of polling on Wednesday. Among the riot-accused  fielded by the BJP in western UP, Suchi Chaudhary, the wife of Mausam  Chaudhary, who is behind the bars on charges of being involved in Penda  riots that took place last September, is contesting from Bijnor city  seat.

Of the eight Bijnor Assembly constituencies, the SP and the BJP had won two seats each while the BSP had led with four seats.

Out  of the 67 seats, the SP had won 34 in the previous 2012 Assembly  elections followed by the BSP which bagged 18 and BJP 10 and the  Congress which had contested elections in partnership with the RLD,  securing three. The remaining two constituencies were bagged by others.
