"Krossover will exclusively manage Priyanka's account for the next two years," Bangad told PTI.
Former Miss World Priyanka Chopra, who is understood to be charging around Rs 3.5 crore per endorsement at present, was earlier handled by Percept Talent Management (PTM).

Asked about the size of the deal, Bangad did not comment but said: "Chopra is among the most paid women brand ambassadors in the country making up to Rs 100 crore from brand endorsements annually."
The actor, who has delivered hits like Fashion, Dostana, Aitraaz and Bluff Master, currently endorses eight brands, including heavyweights such as Nokia, Hero Honda and Tag Heuer.

"In the next 15 days we expect to sign atleast two new deals with a consumer durables and skin care brand," Bangad, who had worked closely with Chopra during her stint with PTM, added.
PTM, on the other hand, is still keen to get Chopra back on board. When contacted Percept Head Shailendra Singh confirmed that the company is in talks with her but declined to provide details.

Chopra is also set to become the National Ambassador of Unicef this week, and would be joining the likes of industry veteran Sharmila Tagore, who is also a National Ambassador and Amitabh Bachchan, who is a 'Goodwill Ambassador' of Unicef.
The celebrity endorsement market has seen a few big deals recently. For instance, cricketer MS Dhoni has signed a deal worth Rs 200 crore with a joint venture firm of Rhiti Sports Management and Mindscapes One.

Similarly, Mates, the celebrity management firm owned by Madison World last week announced signing a Rs 100 crore deal with Bollywood actor John Abraham.
"In today's highly competitive and noisy world, celebrities if used intelligently can enhance brand equity," Madison World Chairman and Managing Director Sam Balsara said.ADVERTISEMENT
