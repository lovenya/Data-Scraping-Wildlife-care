Based on Badan’s statement, five more persons – Khageshwar Manjhi (62), Vidyadhar Manjhi (37), Bada Manjhi (61), Sachin Manjhi (36) and Achyutanand Manjhi (23) – were searched in nearby villages and body parts of leopard, bear and other animals and a muzzle-loading gun were seized from them, he said.As per preliminary information, Badan came across the rotten carcass of a tiger in a jungle close to his village two months back. He and other locals then chopped it and distributed the pieces among them, he said.“Tiger skin, nails and teeth recovered from Badan will be sent to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, to establish which area the big cat belonged to. Its DNA will be matched with five samples of scat (fecal droppings) of tigers sent to the WII from Udanti-Sitanadi tiger reserve in the last one-and-a-half years to ascertain whether the dead tiger belonged to the reserve,” he said.Badan told the forest personnel that six more poachers are also active in the area and efforts are on to trace them, he added. All the accused have been handed over to the Odisha forest department for further action, said officials.
