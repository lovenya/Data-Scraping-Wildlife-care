They keep the lush green abode of wildlife living and thriving through the vital ecosystem services such as maintaining prey population and keeping the food chain balance they provide. Yet, these majestic species are threatened by depleting habitats and lingering demand for their body parts,” according to the report - “India’s Tigers Threatened by Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade” -  authored by  Astha Gautam, Officer, TRAFFIC, India Office, which was published in TRAFFIC POST.One of the most commonly reported causes of mortality in the poaching of tigers is electrocution, which along with snaring, is a disturbing trend that poses a significant risk to tigers and numerous other species, the report states.“Snares, in particular, are cheap and made of easily accessible materials, thus are employed at a concerning scale within the targeted areas to poach wild animals for consumption and trade. Due to the indiscriminate and destructive nature of these poaching methods, an array of wild animals end up as accidental victims. Even those animals, including tigers that manage to survive the snares end up debilitated and suffer due to the wounds, often becoming incapable of hunting their prey, thus ending in conflict with humans,” it said.The report said that there was need to strengthen efforts by enforcement and policymakers to curb the illegal wildlife trade and prevent poaching of tigers within their habitat.According to a global study by TRAFFIC titled 'Skin and Bones Unresolved', the highest number of seizure incidents across 32 countries and territories globally were reported from India for the period 2000-2018. This included 463 seizures amounting to an estimated 625 equivalent tigers, with skin and bones being the top two seizedcommodities. According to the report, skins were the single-most frequently seized tiger part in the world, with 38 per cent of these skins being seized in India. Also, 42 per cent of tiger claws and teeth, and 28 per cent of bones seized globally were reported from India for the study period.
