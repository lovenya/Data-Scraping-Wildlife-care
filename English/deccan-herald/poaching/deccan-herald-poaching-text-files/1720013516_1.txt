They did that through a street play which was staged at a mall in the City recently.
The play, Pukaar, came with the message of non-violence and spread awareness on stopping poaching and also on conserving trees. 

“These were issues that were troubling us and instead of just talking about it, we 
felt that it was time we did something about it. It’s with small things that one can make a big difference and spread the message,” said one of the students.

On October 8 and 9, the college will host Chrizellenze, where students from 
various B Schools across the State will take part. 

More than 100 corporate executives will participate in a conference called D 
Forum, where sessions will be led by eminent guest speakers.  

Apart from that, the two-day fest will see unique combination of events, a carnival, cultural show and a DJ night.  ADVERTISEMENT
