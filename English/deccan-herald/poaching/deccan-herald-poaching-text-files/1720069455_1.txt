Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi's removal as Puducherry's Lt Governor is a well-thought-out political decision by the BJP, which is moving its cards in a bid to not just open its account in the tiny Union Territory but also to play a “key role” in the formation of the next government after the Assembly elections.ADVERTISEMENTIn her four-year stay at the Raj Nivas in Puducherry, Bedi, who has a penchant for stoking controversies, came under severe criticism from various quarters, including the general public, for her “publicity stunts”, especially with regard to issuing challans personally to two-wheeler riders for not wearing helmets.Politically shrewd Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, who has had a running battle with Bedi on various aspects of administration, made Bedi's style of functioning and her “obstructing work” as major issues ahead of the Assembly elections due in April-May. That the duo never got along is a different story altogether.Read: Opposition asks Puducherry CM Narayanasamy to prove majority in assembly; petitions Lt Governor's officeThough the post of Lt Governor is “non-political”, the BJP understood that Bedi was considered as an integral part of the party and her continuance in the post during the election would have placed it at a “disadvantageous position".Narayanasamy had consistently attacking Bedi and the BJP, thereby shifting the focus from the much-talked-about anti-incumbency and the rebellion from within the government against his leadership – two ministers and as many MLAs have so far resigned blaming him.“Narayanasamy was actually hiding behind Bedi by making her unilateral functioning the major poll issue. Now that she has been removed, Narayanasamy will face questions about his governance, especially from those legislators who have quit the Congress and joined the BJP,” senior journalist R Bhagwan Singh told DH.Read: All you need to know about Congress crisis in PuducherryThe BJP has been making concerted efforts to make inroads in Puducherry, as a precursor to its mega plans for neighbouring Tamil Nadu, since 2016 – Bedi appointed three BJP leaders as nominated members to the Assembly.With its efforts not bearing fruit, the BJP has now taken to its time-tested method to get a hold on winning elections – poaching Congress MLAs and fielding them as candidates in the upcoming elections. The BJP is pinning hopes on former Congress legislators to open its account in Puducherry.Hoping to win a handful of seats, the BJP feels its legislators could play an important role in the formation of the next government in the event of a hung assembly. Even being a small part of the government will be a major leap for the BJP, which is trying hard to expand its footprint in southern India, especially in a UT so close to Tamil Nadu that has rejected the party so far.

It could have helped the BJP if Bedi was shunted out a few months back. The BJP should also realise that the sentiments against the party are still strong, and those feelings won't go away in a few months,” a political observer who did not wish to be quoted said.
