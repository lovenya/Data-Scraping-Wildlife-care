A day after a rhino was brutally killed and its horn poached at the Kaziranga National Park, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Friday ordered a high-level probe into the killing. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe Assam chief minister has directed the Additional Chief Secretary T Y Das to probe into the killing of two rhinos in the Kaziranga National Park recently and to submit a report to him immediately.

Two rhinos were killed in the park this week while the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge—Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton were visiting the park. This led to serious concern over the security of the park and was embarrassing for the state government as well.

Gogoi has also ordered to fix up responsibility on the part of those protecting the rhinos.
Terming the killings as “very unfortunate” Gogoi asked the special task force constituted to curb poaching to intensify operations against poachers and their accomplices. He also issued directions for evolving strategies to tackle rhino poaching.
