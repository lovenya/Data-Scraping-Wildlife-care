In 1973, then West Bengal Governor Dharam Veer had gone a step ahead and modified the speech,” he said.

He criticised Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa for calling the Opposition parties’ behaviour an assault on democracy, and asked how people should describe the BJP’s decision to stall Parliament for 35 days and indulging in poaching the members of the Bellary Zilla Panchayat.

Taking a dig at the BJP central leadership for defending Yeddyurappa over his alleged involvement in land scams, he said he had sent all documents pertaining to illegal land deals to the BJP leaders, including L K Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.

Besides, Governor H R Bhardwaj had given a copy of petitions filed by some advocates seeking permission to prosecute the chief minister to Arun Jaitley during his recent visit to Raj Bhavan. 

Still the BJP leaders have chosen to maintain silence, he said.

“The BJP leaders are thick-skinned. It is a heinous act to support a corrupt chief minister.... I have the courage to say this,” he said. The BJP has no moral right to criticise the prime minister on the 2G spectrum scam, he added.

He also said all secular parties in the State, including the JD(S) and the Congress, will together fight against the corrupt government.

‘Tie-up must to keep BJP out’

Gowda said the Congress and the JD(S) should join hands and take over the reins of 10 hung Zilla Panchayats in order to keep the saffron party out.

“Power is not important. The two secular parties should join hands to keep the BJP out. I hope the national party (the Congress) will make up its mind,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT
