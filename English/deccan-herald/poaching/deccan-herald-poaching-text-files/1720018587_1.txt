JD (S) leader H D Deve Gowda’s recent statement about his party’s women corporators-elect being more susceptible to poaching by the BJP has caught them by surprise.

While interacting with the media on September 1, Gowda had said he had given his consent to keep the 14 corporators-elect in hiding, especially the women, fearing foul play by the BJP.

“Of the 14, eight are women. They are all very vulnerable. They might come under pressure from one of their relatives and defect from the party. Also, all of them have been elected for the first time. As we cannot rule out the possibility, we decided to take them out of Bengaluru,” he had said.

The women, however, are not sure what to make of Gowda’s statement. When this reporter sought her reaction, Netra Narayan, corporator-elect from Kavalbyrasandra, said she was stumped by this presumption. 

“I have no words. Unlike men, women are loyal. When we take a decision, we usually see it through... we are focused that way,” she said.

Manjula Narayanswamy, elected from Laggere, said that none of eight women would defect from the JD(S). “We are all loyal party workers. We will abide the decisions taken by the party. This goes for both men and women in the party,” she said.

MLA K Gopalaiah’s wife Hemalatha S P, elected from Vrishabhavathi Nagar, is back in Bengaluru from Kochi. It is rumoured that she would get the deputy mayor’s post in case the Congress and the JD(S) align. She is the only one among the eight women corporators not to continue her stay in Kerala.

“I don’t know what our leader meant when he said that. If one of us tried to defect, it would leave a black mark on our character - which is a risk no woman wants to take,” she added.ADVERTISEMENTNazima Khanam, elected from KR Market, said it was wrong to perceive women as weak. “We are strong-willed than the men and we are ready to do anything for the party,” she said.
