The 73 corporators-elect of the Congress have camped at Club Mahindra and Taj Vivanta resorts near Madikeri in Kodagu district.

ADVERTISEMENTThe team of the newly elected corporators led by legislator S T Somashekhar reached the resorts at 2 am on Tuesday. While 27 women corporators-elect and their family members are staying at Taj Vivanta, the male corporators-elect are camping at Mahindra resort.

Speaking to reporters who visited the resort, Somashekhar said that the BJP managed to capture power at the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) through Operation Lotus last time. 

“Our party members have been brought here to ensure that the BJP is not given such an opportunity this time. The election of mayor and deputy mayor is scheduled for September 11. As the dates of election are nearing, there has been an heightened pressure and luring attempts to poach our party members. We are on a Kodagu tour to avoid the pressure,” he said.

On September 10 noon
Somashekhar said that they would leave for Bengaluru on the noon of September 10. The JD(S), Congress and Independent corporators-elect will meet on that evening for selecting candidates for the posts of mayor and deputy mayor. 

“All of us will go to BBMP head office on the morning of September 11,” he added. Three Congress corporators who have been to Kerala will also join the team in Madikeri.

The elected representatives had planned to visit places of tourist interest in and around Madikeri. However, the day-long drizzle thwarted their plans. Sources said that they are scheduled to visit Dubare elephant camp on Wednesday.
