Sri Lanka today arrested 15 fishermen from here for allegedly poaching in that country's waters near Katchatheevu, police said.

ADVERTISEMENTAll of them were taken to Talaimannar coast along with their three boats, police said quoting Fishermen's Association President Emirit and Sesuraja.

A group of fishermen in 734 boats had gone for fishing in the sea last evening. As the fish availability was very poor, they had crossed over to the Sri Lankan territory.

Indian fishermen were not allowed near Katchatheevu, though they had the right to dry their nets in the island as per the agreement under which the islet was ceded by India to Lanka in 1974, they said.

The Lankan navy personnel surrounded three boats owned by Britto, Kudbuddin and Nizamudin and arrested 15 fishermen in it and took them along with the boats to Talaimannar coast, they said.
