The women and men we honour do not look upon nature conservation as a glorified mission. It’s their way of life. These are the true heroes that generations will look up to when we are gone,” said Bittu Sahgal, Founder, Sanctuary Nature Foundation, and Editor, Sanctuary Asia.“We admire and salute these wildlife defenders who are helping to counter the impact of our climate crisis and improve the quality of life of millions of Indians and helping us build a stronger, more sustainable and vibrant economy. Their work should be celebrated and spread far and wide as they are the true keepers of our threatened planet,” added Hemendra Kothari, Chairman, DSP Asset Managers Pvt. Ltd.“In our view, by protecting our natural resources we can build a stronger, sustainable future, while strengthening India’s long-term economic health,” Nadir Godrej, Chairman and Managing Director, Godrej Industries.
