Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda on Monday alleged that Congress leader Siddaramaiah tried to break JD(S) and poach the party's corporaters to make Congress the party with the majority in the Mysuru Corporation.ADVERTISEMENT"In 2018, Siddaramaiah tried to break the JD(S). Later we came to an understanding with Congress and shared the power. This time also, I told my leaders to give the Mayor post to Congress if Siddaramaiah insisted and in the remaining two years JD(S) could enjoy the power. However, instead of asking us, Siddaramaiah tried to poach our corporaters by breaking the party,"  Gowda told reporters."Despite Congress having 18 corporators, Siddaramaiah tried to break our party and poach our corporator M K Somashekar, which we prevented," Gowda said."Kumaraswamy stayed in Mysuru and successfully prevented all attempt to break the JD(S). Siddaramaiah could have spoken to us. At least he could have spoken to me or Kumaraswamy or Sa. Ra. Mahesh. But, he did not approach us," he said.Gowda blamed Congress for the election for Legislative Council chairman post. "Had Congress took firm shand and spoke to JD(S) current situation would not arise," he said."Basaraj Horatti becoming Chairman of Legislative Council with BJP is support is a personal setback for me as well," Gowda said.Gowda added, "A leader like Siddaramaiah is required by Rahul Gandhi at the national level. There is a dearth of tall leaders like him in Congress. Since a section of leaders is rebelling against the Gandhi family, leaders like Siddaramaiah can strengthen Rahul Gandhi," Gowda said ironically.
