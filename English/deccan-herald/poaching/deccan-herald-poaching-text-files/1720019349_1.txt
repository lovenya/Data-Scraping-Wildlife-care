A day after human rights activist Irom Sharmila decided to end her 16-year hunger strike against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), Manipur on Wednesday tried to make sense of the decision. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe 44-year-old “Iron lady” of Manipur also indicated her wish to marry and contest the 2017 Assembly polls.

While most of her close aides and family members are tight-lipped, the people of Manipur expressed mixed reactions.

A section of the people in Imphal feel the decision might have an adverse impact on the protests against AFSPA, more because recently the Supreme Court had ordered a probe into the “fake” encounters in Manipur. A senior Congress leader on condition of anonymity said: “Till now, Sharmila was the ambassador of the fight against AFSPA. But the people, and perhaps even Sharmila, understood that it was futile. She was ending herself. Now everyone must galvanise their thought to actually turn her decision into an advantage for Manipur.” With the Assembly polls around the corner, speculations are rife that Sharmila might join a political party, and many in Imphal are trying to analyse if she will join the BJP, which is trying to poach power from the Congress. 

Anjuman Ara Begum, South Asia programme officer of Forum-Asia, said: “Sharmila, through her unique and unparalleled strategy of protest,  added awareness about the abuse of AFSPA and gross human rights violations worldwide. If Sharmila travels and talks to people about her movement, it will be more effective for the campaign in the coming days. Coming out of the prison will be more strategic and successful.”

The Save Sharmila Solidarity Campaign (SSSC) has welcomed the decision. “The SSSC knows about how Sharmila always told that she is just a common person without having any desire to be remembered as a hero,” said Ravi Nitesh, SSSC convener.
