Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao's daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha has dared the Narendra Modi government to put her in jail in connection with the Delhi liquor scam.ADVERTISEMENTThe former Lok Sabha MP termed the inclusion of her name in the ED remand report of Amit Arora, one of the accused in the alleged fraud, as the BJP's political conspiracy.ED's arrival before Modi in an election-bound state has become very normal, Kavitha, an MLC now told reporters in Hyderabad early Thursday.“But your ED, CBI tactics won't work here in Telangana. Let them put me in jail, no tension, no one is scared. I won't be intimidated and we will keep exposing the BJP,” Kavitha said.Meanwhile, Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, a YSRCP MP, whose name is also mentioned in the report, said that his family has no involvement in the Delhi liquor business or scam.“The accusations are nothing but the north Indian cabal plot on south Indian businessmen,” Magunta said.Also read | Delhi excise policy: ED arrests businessman Amit Arora on money laundering chargesAmit Arora, a Gurugram-based businessman, was arrested on November 29. The ED has filed an application in a CBI court in New Delhi asking for 14-day custody, to question him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.In its report, the ED mentioned Kavitha's name among the 36 “accused/suspects” who have destroyed or used mobile devices allegedly for dealings in the scam. Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia's name is at the top.The BJP leaders have been alleging the involvement of Kavitha in the Delhi liquor scam for some time now.Without addressing the specifics in the ED report, Kavitha said that she is “ready for any probe, will answer all questions.” “We welcome the (central probe) agencies and will cooperate. But the BJP is trying to defame political opponents with media leaks,” Kavitha said. The development, which could put KCR in an uneasy situation, comes at a time when the TRS government-constituted SIT is probing TRS MLAs' alleged poaching case. While three “Delhi sent agents” are in remand, the SIT has even included BJP national general secretary (organization) BL Santhosh name among the accused.While the matter is in the Telangana HC, KCR had addressed a press conference and played video clips of the interactions of the two seers and a middleman allegedly sent by the BJP leadership to Hyderabad to “buy” four TRS MLAs, with an offer of Rs 50-100 crore each.
