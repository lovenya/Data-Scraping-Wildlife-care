ADVERTISEMENTAccording to a Facebook post by Poorvaj, some BJP leaders contacted former Congman Vishwanath seeking his support to help the party win floor test in Assembly.He wrote, “What u call a horse business or horse buying won’t work out with MR A H Vishwanath... v are dedicated workers not opportunity seekers... forget about dad... u believe I am getting calls to influence him for this... sorry for people who asked me to do this... without power just being an MLA u have rights to stand and support people who have elected us... thank u...” read the post. The post was removed later but not before it was shared by some of his contacts.Vishwanath, who was in the Congress since 1978, joined the JD(S) only last year, citing humiliation in the Congress, especially by former chief minister Siddaramaiah.
