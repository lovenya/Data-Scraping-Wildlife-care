A day after a TV sting landed Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in controversy, former Congress MLA Asif Mohammad Khan on Thursday alleged that senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh offered him a ministerial post for backing AAP’s effort to form a government in the capital last year. Khan claimed that he has audio evidence against Singh. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe AAP leader accepted meeting the former MLA but shifted the blame on the BJP. “He told me that he had a meeting with (Union Surface Transport and Highways Minister) Nitin Gadkari. The BJP offered ministry to Congress MLAs,” he said.

Singh rubbished Khan’s claim of offering him a ministerial post and said, “I will quit politics if the allegations are proved.”

Khan, former legislator from Okhla, also said he met Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia once to discuss possibilities of cobbling up a majority nearly a month before dissolution of Delhi Assembly on November 4.

“I had one meeting with Manish Sisodia and two meetings with Sanjay Singh at a journalist’s house in Noida. He (Singh) never offered me money, but he offered me a ministerial post and chairmanship of different boards to five MLAs in lieu of support,” Khan said.
He said Singh had asked him not to make the conversations between the two public till the time they get closer to forming a government in Delhi. 

“He (Singh) also said that the conversation should not go out of the room because some senior leaders of AAP do not want that we should form the government with Congress’ support,” he added. Khan’s claims found backing from his party colleagues and former legislators Chaudhary Mateen Ahmed and Hasan Ahmed.
