Turahalli forest, a haven for rock climbers from Bangalore, will soon become an official hub for adventure sports because of a local initiative by the State-owned Jungle Lodges and Resorts (JLR).

Jungle Lodge and Resorts, which in recent years, has expanded the scope of its tourism initiatives from wildlife preserves, believes Turahalli to be a prime location for other tourism ventures. Dr Anur Reddy, Managing Editor of JLR, recently spoke to Deccan Herald about the organisation’s aspirations for Turahalli.

“We aim to tap the local tourism potential here. We plan to have about 20 tents. The rocks already exist and we plan to conduct guided treks, led by naturalists,” Reddy said.

The project will be in collaboration with the Eco-tourism Board and the Forest Department. It will also involve a substantial investment in adventure sports under the guidance of the Board. 

Reddy said the commercial aspects of the project and additonal details will be made available within a month.

Isolated hill

Turahalli, located south of Bangalore off Kanakapura Road and eight km from the Banashankari temple, is an isolated hill containing boulders of hard granite of various sizes, suitable for rock climbing. Since the early ‘90s, the number of visitors have risen with Bangalore-based and international rock climbers, especially on week-ends and on holidays. The area also serves as an important training ground for the Bangalore-based climbing groups whose comptetions at the national levels have boosted the reputation of the local climbing community.

One of the few forest tracts near Bangalore, Turahalli, a dry, deciduous forest of 800 acres, is dominated by eucalyptus and other native shrubs. 

The forest is home to large numbers of wildlife such as jackal, hare, monitor-lizard and mongoose. It is also a favoured destination for bird-watching groups, who have recorded the presence of over 70 species, including the Great Horned Owl.

Turahalli is also a frequent destination for school camps, which exposes children to nature. Most camp activities revolve around watching and identifying birds, butterflies and insects or learning the basics of rock climbing and rappelling.

Because of its pristine nature, there has been rampant poaching and urban encroachment in the forest. However, Reddy said things have improved. 

“Boundaries have been demarked and the entire area has been fenced,” he said. Turahalli forest was previously in the news when it was identified to be converted into a tree park by the State government.
