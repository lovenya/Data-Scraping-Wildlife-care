The Forest Department is working to revive the Great Indian Bustard population in the Ranebennur blackbuck sanctuary in Haveri district. ADVERTISEMENTThe sanctuary lost the critically endangered bird to poaching and afforestation drives by the department, which now wants to correct its strategy by reviving the grassland. “We got an oral clearance from the central government at the last meeting in March to axe the trees in the sanctuary and make it a grassland again. Now, a detailed plan is being prepared and submitted to the Centre for written orders under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” Sanjai Mohan, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), told DH. Since the bustard population is reviving in Rajasthan, the Karnataka government wanted to translocate some of the animals here. But the Rajasthan government did not accept the request, leaving Karnataka with no other option but to revive using a dozen animals in Ballari and Koppal. The department’s focus has now shifted from Nagarahole and Bandipur to the dry zones. “Massive afforestation resulted in the growth of several eucalyptus and acacia trees in Ranebennur and other dry zones, driving away GIB, blackbucks, wolves, fox and jackals. We are now focusing on these lesser-known species. We are also persuading companies to hand over land under CSR to us in Ballari to increase the grasslands for them,” Mohan said. Experts support the idea, but also advise caution. Senior wildlife conservationist Samad Kottur wanted the department to preserve the local flora and fauna, weeds and grasslands while creating the grassland. A study on India’s important bird areas found Ranebennur to be in a sad state. While the loss of grassland has left the place with no birds, a revival would bring back blackbucks followed by the bustard, he said.
