The scientific bird census being held at the Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Hills tiger reserve, on behalf of the Forest department, concluded on Sunday.

ADVERTISEMENTA total of 22 transect lines had been identified to carry out the census in the tiger reserve. On the first day, the census was carried out on 11 transect lines. On the third and last day, the ornithologists carried out the census on the remaining transect lines.

Rare birds like rusty-tailed fly catcher and white-bellied minivet were spotted by the experts on Sunday. There are 21 varieties of drongos in the world. Among them, six different varieties were spotted in the Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Hills.

Those who went on the census duty in the morning, came across a rare hair-crested dongro. The census was carried out in Chamarajanagar, Kollegal, Punajanuru, K Gudi, Bailuru and Yelanduru, which come under the tiger reserve limits. The enumerators were provided with boarding and lodging facilities at the K Gudi Guest House and at the anti-poaching camps located in the heart of the tiger reserve.

“The scientific bird census, being held for the first time in the State by the Forest department, has come to an end. The 11 teams formed for the census work have come across very rare varieties of birds. 

However, the details of the birds will be finally available only after the census forms of all the members are collected and reviewed,” BRT Tiger Project Forest Conservator and Director Vijay Mohanraj told Deccan Herald. 

Some of the birds are found in almost all parts of the forest, while some are spotted only in the green belts. There are chances of spotting the same bird on different transect lines. All the census forms will be scrutinised in detail for a couple of days and a final picture will be arrived at after this, he explained.
