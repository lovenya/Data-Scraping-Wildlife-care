Talking in detail about the daunting task that his ministry is entrusted with, he said “to save the pristine land being diverted for developmental projects, we are ensuring that the Forest Conservation Act remain sacrosanct”.

He was speaking at a function to launch Bengal Tiger Conservation Programme here.

He said after seven years of deadlock, the states have got over Rs 11,000 crore for protection and restoration of natural forest cover under the Campa (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) Fund, he said.

“The fund offer a unique and historic opportunity to invest in our forests. The world plantation doesn’t figure in the Campa guidelines. It will ensure a largest carbon sink in the world,” he added.

On the relocation of at least 80,000 families living inside the core areas of protected forests, he said they have been offered Rs 10 lakh or a piece of land as compensation package to move out of the reserves. 

Ramesh said that amendments in the Wildlife Protection Act are on the platter to make it more deterrent against the poachers and anti-wildlife smuggling activities.

“We are in talks with the concerned stakeholders to bring comprehensive changes in the Act and also in the process to strengthen Wildlife Crime Control Bureau to develop intelligence,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT
