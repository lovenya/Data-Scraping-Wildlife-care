Asking Santhosh to “not tamper with the evidence in the case in any manner whatsoever,” the letter further says that he could be arrested if he fails to appear before the SIT in the Hyderabad police command control center on Monday.The restraining orders came after Telangana BJP leader Premender Reddy approached the high court. The court has posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.Meanwhile, hearing a submission by the SIT, the court has also directed the Delhi police to cooperate with the SIT in serving the notice to Santhosh.The Telangana BJP is alleging that the notices and the SIT probe in the first place are politically motivated to defame their party.Following the arrests of the three alleged BJP agents at a farmhouse near Hyderabad on October 26, T-BJP general secretary Premender Reddy approached the Telangana High Court seeking a free and fair probe in the TRS MLAs' alleged bribing matter and transfer of the case to the CBI or a commission of enquiry under a sitting HC judge.While the court rejected the CBI probe plea, the KCR government constituted a Special Investigation Team on November 9 with C V Anand, Hyderabad Commissioner of Police, as head.Further, the high court on November 15 passed orders that a single judge will monitor the SIT investigation. “The progress of investigation has to be submitted before him in a sealed cover by the SIT from time to time.”
