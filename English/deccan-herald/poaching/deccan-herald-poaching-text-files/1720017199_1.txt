Noted chefs are now creating sumptuous dishes for airlines to ensure that your taste buds are tantalised even when you are amidst the clouds. What’s more, you can actually recreate those fancy business-class meals in your own kitchen, writes Preeti Verma Lal.ADVERTISEMENTEvery person, be it a gourmand or a frugal eater, knows about the quartet of taste: sweet, sour, bitter, salty. 

This is no rocket science and is ground-level reality. But did you know your taste buds behave differently at higher altitudes? This might sound like freaky science, but the moment you step into an aircraft, your noise dries up and your sense of smell starts fading. At a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, your taste buds vanish and cotton mouth sets in. Is it surprising then that for many years, airlines have been sedulously studying the science of high-altitude food? And it is to beat this insipid mid-air food syndrome that Qatar Airways hired four Michelin-starred Master Chefs to redo the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s business-class menu. Nobu Matsuhisa, Tom Aikens, Ramzi Choueiri and London-based, Indian-born Vineet Bhatia, each a master of his cuisine, spent months tweaking their favourite recipes for the moneyed business travellers. For them, it was not merely about spices and flavours – they dug into science to prepare dishes best-suited for long-haul flights.For example, on a 16-hour flight across 12,731 km from Doha to Dallas, there’s fish kebbeh, thyme-roasted chicken breast, mushroom paratha, classic Arabic mezze, mustard and dill salmon, spinach-paneer tikki on the menu. For Vineet Bhatia, the only Indian who runs two restaurants with Michelin stars, rustling scrumptious dishes for the airline was like a detour from his childhood dream. “I got into the kitchen by mistake, I wanted to be a pilot,” he admits. It isn’t an easy run though. Due to pressurised aircraft cabin, the dishes need to be picked carefully. Stronger flavours through herbs, spices, seasonal ingredients are absolute essential. So, Vineet hunched over recipes, picked lessons from science of airline food and pulled rabbits out of his toque. But to savour his spinach-paneer tikki, pineapple korma, flaky vegetable parcel, or Nobu’s signature block cod, you’ll have to pull out wads of money to buy a business-class ticket. 

It can burn a huge hole in the pocket. Wish you could cook a business-class meal at home? You can now. Vineet shares some of his recipes. Take the recipes into the kitchen. Boil, poach, beat and braise. Then, grill, fry, bake and simmer. Get the dish on the table and dig your fork into the sumptuous fare. Fly high, business-class style, in your own home, minus the jetlag and expenditures.  Pineapple kormaIngredients: Vegetable oil:15gmMustard seeds:2gmGarlic, chopped:5gmGinger, chopped:2gmGreen chilli, chopped:2gmOnion, chopped:25gmCurry leaves:1gmTurmeric powder:0.5gmPineapple, small, peeled and diced into 1 cm cubes:290gmThick coconut milk:280gmJaggery:15gmSalt:to tasteMethod:In a pan, heat vegetable oil and add the mustard seeds.
