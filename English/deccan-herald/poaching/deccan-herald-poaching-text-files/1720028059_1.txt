A video purportedly showing Congress MLAs Anand Singh and J N Ganesh’s “infamous” fight at a resort has gone viral on social media.ADVERTISEMENTThe five-second clip apparently shot on a mobile phone shows the two legislators engaged in a tussle and shouting at each other.The fight happened when Congress had holed up its MLAs at Eagleton resort in Bidadi in January this year, apparently to prevent them from being poached by the BJP.The fight made national headlines with Singh being hospitalised and Ganesh going absconding. In the video, Singh is seen holding Anand’s collar and shouting “Hodithiya.. yar thappoo.. Awala thappu” (Will you hit... whose mistake, it's her mistake”. The video is unsteady and ends with someone saying “bido lo”(leave).Singh has since been discharged from hospital and Ganesh, who surfaced nearly a month after the incident, has been arrested following a complaint by the former.
