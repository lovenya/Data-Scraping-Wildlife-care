In a major setback to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah at his home district, Janata Dal (Secular) and BJP renewed their bond again, keeping Congress at bay to hold the reins of Taluk Panchayat. 

ADVERTISEMENTIn the elections to the post of president and vice-president of the panchayat held on Thursday, G Kumar from JD(S), and Lokamani from BJP were elected president and vice-president, respectively.

 Kumar represents Naganahalli constituency and Lokamani Devalapura seat in the panchayat.

 The reservation for the post of president was fixed for general candidate, while for the vice-president post, general (woman) candidate.

 Their period in office will be 20 months.

In the 29 member Panchayat, Congress has the highest of 12 members against JD(S)’ - 11. BJP has six members. Taking advantage of the same,  JD(S) and BJP joined hands to cross the magic number of 15,  to ascend to power.

In the previous term, Congress had spiked the plans of its rivals, by poaching four BJP members to its side to hold the seats of both president and vice-president.

JD(S) MLA from Chamundeshwari G T Devegowda said it was decided to join hands with the saffron party, only to teach a fitting lesson to the Congress. 

Congress when in power had adopted step motherly attitude while allocating funds to other party members.

 Elections to ZP president and vice-president will also be held soon.
