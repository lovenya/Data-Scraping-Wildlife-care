Your party has refused to even entertain its 2-time manifesto promise of the Women's Reservation Bill," she said on X (formerly twitter)."Speaking of ticket distribution by the BRS Party, we understand your frustration & confusion. You were waiting to poach our candidates who did not get the tickets. Please don't link your political insecurities to Womenâ€™s representation," said Kavitha, daughter of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.CM KCR himself believes that without a constitutional right in place just like that of local bodies that now gives 14 lakh women a chance to represent, this is not possible at the national and assembly level, she said.KCR has proposed a formula to increase the number of seats in Parliament and reserve one-third of them for women leaders. BRS "does not sell jumlas" like the BJP, she alleged."I would like to hear your opinion on the issue of women's representation and see what the BJP, Congress, and other parties have to offer to the women of Telangana when it comes to the matter of ticket distribution," she said.Also Read:KCR betrayed people of Telangana over 'water, funds, jobs': BJP's Prakash JavadekarAlso Read:KCR betrayed people of Telangana over 'water, funds, jobs': BJP's Prakash JavadekarIn a veiled reference to Kavitha holding a protest in Delhi earlier demanding 33 per cent reservation for women, Kishan Reddy on Monday said such a quota for women has not been followed in the allotment of tickets."Bangaru Kutumbam (golden family) Family members created drama in Jantar Mantar demanding for 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament.
