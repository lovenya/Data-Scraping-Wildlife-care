Almost a month after his wife joined the BJP, cricketer Ravindra Jadeja's sister pledged allegiance to Congress on Sunday during an election campaign of the party's Lok Sabha candidate Mulu Kondariya in Jamnagar.ADVERTISEMENTNainaba, elder sister of cricketer Ravindra Jadeja, joined Congress in presence of her father Anirudhsinh Jadeja and Congress leader Hardik Patel. Last month, Naina's sister-in-law and wife of Jadeja Rivaba had joined BJP.After joining the party, Nainaba told reporters that "she will be campaigning for Congress as the BJP has not been able to work for farmers. The promises made were not materialised."Her joining comes in wake of the fact the BJP has been poaching Congress leaders in a big way. Apart from five Congress MLAs, the BJP has been able to break Congress at the grassroots level by luring then to switch sides.
