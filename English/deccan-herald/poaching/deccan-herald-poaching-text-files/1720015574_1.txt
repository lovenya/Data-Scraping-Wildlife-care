Amid division in NDA over opposing UPA Presidential nominee Pranab Mukherjee, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said he favoured a consensus on the issue of candidature for which efforts were on within the Opposition alliance.

But the final decision will be taken by the NDA. As part of its constituent, the JD (U) will abide by the decision arrived at the NDA meet,” said the JD (U) strongman, whose word is perceived to be the “final say” in the party.

Four reasons

Kumar’s apparent support for Mukherjee is based on four premises. First, he sees the Presidential election as an attempt to mend ties with the Congress. 

In exchange of support for Mukherjee, the Congress may accede to Kumar’s long-pending demand of a special status to Bihar and a central university in the state. He has written a fresh letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reiterating his demand and is planning a fresh agitation on the issue.

 Secondly, it is said that Kumar is not keen on BJP spreading its tentacles at the national level through the Presidential election, particularly at a time when a section of the saffron camp and the RSS want to project his arch-rival Narendra Modi as the next prime-ministerial candidate of NDA.

Thirdly, Kumar is one of the few NDA leaders who enjoys a good personal rapport with Mukherjee. 

Therefore, he does not want to antagonise the senior-most Congress leader by opposing his candidature.

Fourthly, with growing uneasiness between the two ruling partners in Bihar, the JD (U) and the BJP, the Congress has stopped criticising his party, which has led to speculations that new equations may emerge before the 2014 elections.

In a 243-member House, Kumar increased the JD (U) tally from 115 to 118 by poaching three of the four LJP MLAs. He is short of just four legislators (122 members needed for majority) to run a government without external support. 

Incidentally, the Congress has four MLAs in the Assembly, which may not be a substitute to the BJP (91 MLAs), but is sufficient enough to provide the much-needed succour.
