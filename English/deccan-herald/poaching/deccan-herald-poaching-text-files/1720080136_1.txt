The Rajasthan government on Wednesday urged the Supreme Court to direct actor Salman Khan to surrender to serve his five-year jail term for killing two chinkaras (black buck).

It contended that the high court relied upon “hyper-technical” issues to overturn “erroneously” the conviction of 50-year-old Khan.

“The high court has erroneously exercised its revisional powers to set aside concurrent findings of both the lower courts,  which convicted and sentenced Salman Khan to jail for five years,” the state government said.

The state also contended that Khan’s lawyers had ample opportunity to cross-examine eyewitness Harish Dulani, the driver, and when they did not examine him intentionally, the statement given by the witness should be accepted against the actor. It urged the apex court to restore the 2006 trial court judgements and direct him to surrender to serve the remaining period of his sentence.

“Minor discrepancies in the trial shall never dilute the entire prosecution case and the high court has failed to see the entire circumstances, which are proved beyond doubt against Khan by the prosecution,” the state said.
