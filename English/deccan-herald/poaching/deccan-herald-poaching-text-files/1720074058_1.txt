Massive fire has encompassed Uttarakhand's forests. Efforts have been intensified to extinguish the raging forest fires in the state, especially in the worst-affected areas of Nainital, Haldwani and Ramnagar forest divisions, forest officials told news agency PTI.ADVERTISEMENTOn Sunday, Indian Air Force (IAF) was engaged in firefighting operations in Nainital district.As of now, the cause of the fire is unknown but let's take a look at the potential causes of forest fires and see how frequent these are in India.

These include deliberate fires by locals, carelessness, farming-related activities, and natural reasons. Furthermore, a government report states that locals in Uttarakhand deliberately set forests on fire for good quality of grass, poaching, to cover up illegal deforestation, and more. The report also states that the friction of electricity cables with dry leaves can be a cause for wildfires.According to the Indian Penal Code, setting a forest on fire is a punishable offence. A forest officer told the Indian Express that several cases have been lodged but the accused often remains unidentified in such cases.

FSI website states that nearly 36 per cent forests in India are prone to fires.Temperatures, precipitation, vegetation, and moisture also contribute to the frequency of these fires. Experts say that fuel load, oxygen and temperature also cause these fires.Fire incidents in the country are mainly reported during the months of March, April, and May due to the availability of dry biomass after the end of winter and prior to summer, IE noted.“Severe fires occur in many forest types particularly dry deciduous forest, while evergreen, semi-evergreen and montane temperate forests are comparatively less prone (India State of Forest Report 2015)… Nearly 4 per cent of the country’s forest cover is extremely prone to fire, whereas 6 per cent of forest cover is found to be very highly fire prone (ISFR 2019)", FSI website further states.In its 2021 report, FSI found out that states in the northeast have higher tendency for forest fires. Moreover, parts of western Maharashtra, central Odisha, southern Chhattisgarh, regions in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh also have showed the prevalence of fire-prone zones.
