Considering the density of the forest, the forest officials rule out poaching and suspect that the big cat might have died in a fight for territory. 

Bhadra Reserve Forest Deputy Conservator of Forest Gaonkar said that exact reason for the death would be ascertained only after the post mortem.

Two months ago, an injured tiger which was caught in Gama village in Shikaripur taluk was released in Muthodi forest in the presence of Minister Jairam Ramesh. Villagers suspect that the same tiger is dead.
