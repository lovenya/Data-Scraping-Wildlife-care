The Congress party on Wednesday alleged that BJP is attempting to 'poach' their elected representatives.ADVERTISEMENT“BJP is in touch with 5-6 of our MLAs," said Minister Ramalinga Reddy. "It’s not new for the BJP (to poach). The entire country knows how the BJP formed the majority in 2008 by making 17 Congress and JD(S) MLAs resign," he said.MLA elect TD Rajegowda from Sringeri constituency confirmed to reporters that he had been approached by the BJP.

"They (BJP) keep on calling but we don't bother about it. I have clearly asked them not to call me. I am a committed Congress person," he said. 

Meanwhile, Reddy expressed confidence that Congress will be able to hold its own against BJPs tactics.   
 
"If the Governor chooses to invite the BJP first, we will chalk out our next course of action. Governor cannot do that according to a recent SC order. There are laws. Everything cannot go as per the wishes of Modi and Shah,” Reddy told ANI after the meet.He also said that there is a plan to parade MLAs before the Governor while adding that they are ready to sign a resolution supporting HD Kumaraswamy becoming Chief Minister.Mangaluru MLA UT Khader also clarified that "all party legislators are together and we will abide by the party’s decision."
