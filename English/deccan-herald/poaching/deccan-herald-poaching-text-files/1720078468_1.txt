Bengaluru: Responding to Kerala's plea for allowing night traffic on the Bandipur-Sultan Bathery (Wayanad) road inside the tiger reserve, Forest Minister Eshwar B Khandre on Tuesday said vehicles may be allowed in in emergency situations.ADVERTISEMENTDuring his visit to Bandipur, which has witnessed a significant number of man-animal conflict cases, the minister examined animal movement on the road. This road had been closed to traffic following the death of wild animals struck by vehicles.Traffic movement is closed between 9 pm and 6 am on the roads connecting Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While Tamil Nadu has agreed to the ban on the use of a 36 km stretch in the core area at night, Kerala has moved the Supreme Court seeking the lifting of the ban on the road (National Highway 212), of which 24.5 km passes through the core area of the tiger reserve. The Supreme Court upheld the ban in 2019.Also Read:Four arrested for desecrating Dr Ambedkar's statue in KalaburagiAlso Read:Four arrested for desecrating Dr Ambedkar's statue in Kalaburagi Gathering details of the number of vehicles passing through the checkposts during the day, Khandre held a meeting with the officials on various issues, including a plea by the Kerala government to allow night traffic.Currently, only ambulances and five buses each from Karnataka and Kerala are allowed on the road during the night.
