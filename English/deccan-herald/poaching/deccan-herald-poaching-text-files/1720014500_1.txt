Like Yeddyurappa, Shettar is also a Lingayat leader. If he manages to win the support of mutts, especially those in North Karnataka, he can emerge as a strong contender. Shettar, it is learnt, has been in touch with some of the influential mutts and is trying to persuade them to intervene in the issue.

Speculations are rife that many Lingayat MLAs of the party, who were backing Yeddyurappa, have decided to support Shettar after getting phone calls from their religious leaders. Most of these legislators are from North Karnataka. 

Fearing poaching of legislators by the rival camp, Yeddyurappa on Monday sent his supporters to hotels and resorts, sources said. Sources added that about 15 MLAs from the Yeddyurappa camp met Shettar and pledged their support to him. 

The BJP has 38 Lingayat MLAs and a majority of them support Yeddyurappa, who wants his close confidant and Member of Parliament D V Sadananda Gowda to be his successor so that he can have control over the government. 

Yeddyurappa had over the years emerged as a Lingayat leader with the support of the mutts. 

Largesse
He had generously granted funds to the mutts. However, his backing Sadananda Gowda as his successor, has not gone down well with the mutts.

Sources close to Shettar said that playing the Lingayat card would put Yeddyurappa in a fix as he will not be able to oppose the stand taken by the mutts.

Moreover, going by the caste polarisation in the State, all Lingayat MLAs of the party will be forced to back Shettar if they get any such instruction from the mutts.
Besides, the Lingayat community is concentrated mostly in North Karnataka. As Shettar hails from the region, the mutts would come out in support of his candidature for the top post, sources in the Shettar camp said.
