The video, which allegedly shows BJP leaders poaching an AAP MLA, is an attempt to "defame" the party, BJP leader Vijender Gupta said Monday.

ADVERTISEMENTGupta said: "They (AAP) have been doing this for long now. Earlier they made allegations against (BJP leader and union minister) Nitin Gadkari and later aplogised and now again they are attacking us."

"This is an attempt to defame the party," the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.

"Though, I have not seen the video but even if (Delhi BJP vice president Sher Singh) Dagar interacted with the (AAP) MLA, it was in his personal capacity and not as a leader of the BJP," he added.

The AAP Monday released a video which showed some BJP leaders allegedly offering a plum post and money to AAP legislator Dinesh Mohaniya in a bid to form the government in Delhi.

Delhi has been under President's rule since Kejriwal resigned as chief minister Feb 14 after just 49 days in office.
