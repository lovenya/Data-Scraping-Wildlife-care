Poachers killed a female four-horned antelope, an endangered species, at the Rangayyanadurga Wildlife Sanctuary in Jagalur taluk of Davangere district on Tuesday. The animal is currently protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.ADVERTISEMENT
According to forest officials, the poachers killed it with blows to the head, after trapping it in a snare. 
When they tried to escape with the kill, they were waylaid by a forest guard and the deputy range forest officer in the Rakkasagudda area of the sanctuary. 
They abandoned the kill and fled. The animal’s body has been recovered. The post-mortem showed that the antelope was  pregnant.
Forest department officials said that though they had identified the poachers, pressure from local people and politicians had prevented them from making arrests. 
None of the six accused have been named in the first information report.
Although the authorities had been informed about the special status granted to the four-horned antelope, this is the third poaching incident in 
the last fortnight in Jaglur taluk. No arrests have been made in the previous incidents also. 
Forest department officials said the Rangayyanadurga sanctuary should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the wildlife division, so that future poaching attempts can be stopped.
