Addressing reporters, he said his party will shortly file a public interest litigation in the  High Court. The probe should cover allegations made by both ruling and Opposition parties, besides CDs released by them. The JD(S) will also file a complaint with the Karnataka Lokayukta seeking a probe on the issue, he added.

He alleged Yeddyurappa is making use of influential mutts to poach MLAs of the Opposition parties. A pontiff of Valmiki samaj spoke to JD(S) MLA from Srinivaspura G K Venkatashiva Reddy over phone and asked to resign to help the BJP. Similarly, party MLA Basavarajan was also approached by a pontiff of another mutt, he alleged.

‘Fight together’

Addressing reporters in New Delhi, JD(S) National President H D Deve Gowda has demanded dismissal of Yeddyurappa-led government and urged secular parties to stand united in fighting BJP’s ‘Operation Lotus’. 

“Yeddyurappa-led government had again launched operation lotus to lure JD(S) and Congress MLAs by using money and muscle power,” Gowda told reporters here. Describing the upcoming festive season as the “darkest Diwali in Karnataka's history,” he said the horse-trading of MLAs and the multi-crore mining scam in Bellary were the reasons.ADVERTISEMENT
