IT raids were conducted at 60 to 65 places, mainly concentrating in Bangalore and Bellary, said sources in IT department, whose action comes amidst allegations of horse-trading by both BJP and opposition.

They told PTI that business premises of seven legislators, including mining magnates Reddy brothers and their close associate and minister B Sriramulu were raided.

Some mining companies were also raided by IT department. Besides Bangalore and Bellary, raids were also conducted in Hospet.

Both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress and JD-S have been trading charges of horse-trading to poach on their respective MLAs.

The Opposition has lost four MLAs, who have resigned their Assembly membership, which the Congress and JD-S have alleged was an attempt by the BJP to shore up its numbers in the 224-member Assembly.

Eleven BJP MLAs had rebelled against the Yeddyurappa Government and withdrawn their support as also five independent legislators who have all been disqualified by the Speaker.

The political crisis saw Yeddyurappa face the trial of strength in the Assembly twice. The first vote of confidence carried by voice vote was rejected by Governor H R Bhardwaj, who called it unconstitutional before giving another opportunity to Yeddyurappa to demonstrate his strength.

In the second floor test, Yeddyurappa government sailed through with 106 votes in its favour and 100 against in the House with an effective strength of 208.

However, the Karnatka High Court, hearing petitions challenging the disqualification of the MLAs, had said the trust vote outcome was subject to its verdict on the petitions by the independents.

A third judge, to whom the matter was referred after a split verdict by a two-member division bench, has reserved his orders on the plea by 11 rebel BJP MLAs while the hearing on the independent MLAs petitions has been adjourned to November 2.ADVERTISEMENT
