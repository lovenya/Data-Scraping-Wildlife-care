BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa on Friday declined to comment on Union Minister Prakash Javadekar’s recent prediction that there could be a ‘political dhamaka’ in the state in December.ADVERTISEMENTJavadekar had claimed that only Yeddyurappa knew what was going to happen in the state. This had sparked speculation that the saffron party would activate Operation Lotus (a moniker for poaching legislators), spooking the Congress-JD(S) coalition."Our party has 104 legislators and we will work as an Opposition. We will not do anything to topple the government. How can we be responsible if the coalition falls on its own,” Yeddyurappa asked. "Let them keep their MLAs in tact. They should stop unnecessarily dragging our name."Asked to comment on an audio clipping that was aired by news channels recently suggesting that the party was making an effort to poach ten Congress MLAs, Yeddyurappa said: "I don’t have information (about the tape). It has nothing to do with our party.”
