The BJP in Uttar Pradesh is working overtime to  find a place for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the state Legislative  Council. 

The six-month deadline for the chief minister to  become a member of the state legislature to retain his post ends on  August 19, and a section of the party feels that he should be  accommodated in the Upper House that would allow him to focus on the  government. 

The BJP has already persuaded two MLCs of the  Samajwadi Party and one BSP member to resign to accommodate Adityanath  and four of his ministerial colleagues (without a place in the  Assembly). 

The party is also busy poaching non-NDA MLCs to ensure the process is smooth. 

BJP  sources said its leadership is in talks to rope in independent MLA  Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya after his close aide from SP  Yashwant Singh quits the Legislative Council to join the NDA. Bhaiya and  Singh were ministers in the Akhilesh Yadav government. 

If  Bhaiya agrees to be part of the NDA, the controversial MLA representing  Kunda constituency will be made a minister in the Yogi government.  Bhaiya is no stranger to the BJP, having been a minister in the  erstwhile governments of Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta and Rajnath  Singh.

Besides Singh, another SP MLC Bukkal Nawab has also quit the Upper House to align with the BJP. 

The  party is also trying to woo expelled BSP MLC Naseemudin Siddiqui, after  its own Vidhan Parishad member Thakur Jaiveer Singh sent in his  resignation to the Upper House chairman. 

The party seems unsure  if it should let Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya continue in  UP government or recall him for central duties. Maurya currently  represents Phulpur Lok Sabha seat. 

The party has been busy  clearing up seats in Vidhan Parishad for the other Deputy Chief Minister  Dinesh Sharma and ministers Swatantra Deo Singh and Mohsin Raza, who  are not members of the Assembly or the Council.
