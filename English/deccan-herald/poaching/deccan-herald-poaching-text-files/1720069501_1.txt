A day after Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy charged that the BJP was still making efforts to poach Congress MLAs, Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah too made the same charge.ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking during the Republic Day celebrations organised at the Congress party office, Siddaramaiah said that the BJP was trying to lure his party MLAs with money gained through illegal means. “There is no Operation Kamala. The BJP has completely failed at its efforts. The party’s ill-gotten wealth is being used to buy off Congress MLAs. What the chief minister has said is true. The BJP is still making attempts to lure my party MLAs,” he added.
