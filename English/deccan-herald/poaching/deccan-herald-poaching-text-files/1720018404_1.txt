Continued deforestation, rapid urbanisation and pollution has posed a great threat to wildlife and its conservation, said writer and conservationist Bikram Grewal, here, on Saturday.

Common birds and animals, found in grasslands are among the worst affected, with their numbers declining at an alarming rate. Species living in shrub forests too are threatened, he said.

Despite elaborate conservation measures, poaching incidents too has affected wildlife, especially in the North Eastern states of the country. Efforts should be made to put an end to it, he said.
