The Congress leadership has convinced its Gujarat MLAs to stay at a resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru till the eve of the Rajya Sabha polls on August 8.

According to sources, the MLAs who have been confined to the resort were longing to go back. The raids at the resort on Wednesday have also shaken the MLAs.

 As many as 43 Gujarat legislators have been housed at the resort since Saturday to protect them from being ‘poached’ by the BJP ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls. 

Speculation is rife that I-T officials were already present inside the resort, disguised as guests, when the raids took place. CCTV camera footage showing the I-T sleuths entering the resort and walking straight to the room of Energy Minister D K Shivakumar without making any enquiry with the staff has raised this suspicion.  Shivakumar, who was looking after logistics of the accommodation of the legislators, has been confined to his residence following the raids.

Sensing the mood at the resort on Friday, KPCC chief G Parameshwara sent word to the legislators that they will be safe at the resort. It is just a matter of three more days and it is the responsibility of the state Congress to look after them. They are likely to be flown to Gandhinagar on the evening of August 7.

Gujarat Congress MLA Gyasuddin Shaikh said, “We are all united. Parameshwara has convinced us to continue our stay.” Late in the evening, seven JD(S) rebel MLAs, led by Zameer Ahmad Khan visited the resort and interacted with the Gujarat legislators.ADVERTISEMENT
