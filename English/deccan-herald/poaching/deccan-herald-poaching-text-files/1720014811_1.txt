According to a study by Right Management, 75 per cent of US employers surveyed said they involuntarily lost their many high-performing employees over the past 12 months.

While, only 13 per cent of respondents’ organisations saw no departures of top talent over the past 12 months, the remaining 12 per cent said they didn’t know if they lost top talent.

“There’s a furious war for top talent under way, constant poaching of high performers by competing companies and, overall, a very restive workforce. The latest survey shows organisations losing the employees they need and erosion that may accelerate once the job market picks up,” Right Management Group Executive Vice President (US) Bram Lowsky said.ADVERTISEMENT
