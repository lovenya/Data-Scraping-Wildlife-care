She also refused to go home with him. The wife's accusations and refusal to go with him apparently angered the man to the extent that he took out a knife from his pocket, which he had brought from home, and attacked her inside the police station. He tried to stab her in the neck which left a deep cut, a senior police officer said. The police personnel inside the station soon overpowered the man and took him into custody, he said. The woman who sustained grievous injuries was rushed to a nearby hospital where she is undergoing treatment. She is out of danger, he added.
