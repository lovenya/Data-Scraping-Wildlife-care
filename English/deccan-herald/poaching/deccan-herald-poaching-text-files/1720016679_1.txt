During his 20 minute meeting, Kharge is understood to have requested the Home Minister to take firm action to prevent BJP's attempt to poach Congress MLAs in a bid to keep the B S Yeddyurappa government in power, sources said.

Kharge, who hails from Karnataka, is also said to have cited a few examples how the BJP was trying to bring the Congress legislators into its fold.

The fate of Yeddyurappa government, which had won two trust votes in the Assembly on October 11 and 14, still hangs in the balance as the Karnataka High Court is yet to pronounce its verdict on the disqualifications of 11 BJP and 5 Independent MLAs who revolted against the BJP governmentADVERTISEMENT
