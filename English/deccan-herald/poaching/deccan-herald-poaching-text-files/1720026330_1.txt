The BJP on Thursday called Congress’ Rajya Sabha member BK Hariprasad a “rogue” after he mocked the saffron party's national president Amit Shah’s health condition.ADVERTISEMENTShah is suffering from swine flu and was admitted to AIIMS on Wednesday.Hariprasad received flak for taking a jibe at Shah’s health condition during a protest the Congress staged at Maurya Circle in Bengaluru against the BJP’s alleged attempt to poach legislators in a bid to topple the Congress-JD(S) coalition.“Some legislators were kidnapped and taken to Mumbai where the BJP and RSS guarded them. But some MLAs have come back because of which Amit Shah got scared and fell ill. It’s not just any illness, he has swine flu. If you try to topple the Karnataka government, you won’t get just swine flu, but you’ll also suffer from vomiting and loose motion,” Hariprasad said in Kannada during his speech at the protest.Hariprasad’s “distasteful” comment went viral on social media.In a tweet, the BJP requested Congress president Rahul Gandhi to admit Hariprasad to NIMHANS - a mental health hospital - for treatment. “Congress MP & AICC General Secretary BK Hariprasad mocking at health condition of Sri Amit Shah Ji shows his mental stability. This rogue needs to learn human values & is unfit to live in a civilised society,” the saffron party said.
