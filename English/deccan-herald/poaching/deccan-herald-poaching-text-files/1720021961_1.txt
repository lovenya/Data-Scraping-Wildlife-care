Congress MLAs from Gujarat, who have been lodged at the Eagleton resort at Bidadi near Bengaluru, are likely to be shifted to a resort in Kodagu district.

Party leaders are working behind the scenes to lodge the legislators in one of the resorts at Galibeedu, K Nidugani, Kadagadalu, Kakkabbe, Kedamalluru and Siddapura, sources said. However, there is no official confirmation regarding these developments. 
Galibeedu is said to be better suited since the resort is at an altitude and will be inaccessible to BJP leaders and people from the media. It is also close to Madikeri. 

Another option being considered is the resort near Kakkabbe which is nestled amid serene coffee plantations. 

Mobile connectivity is also not available there. It is only accessible through landline connection. 
The two places are said to have excellent facilities for the legislatorsâ€™ stay. The same has been conveyed to a senior minister.

Disadvantageous for party

However, all legislators from the district belong to the BJP, except one Congress MLC. This might prove disadvantageous for the party, a leader told DH. 

A few members of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike had been taken to the resort at Galibeedu during elections to the post of mayor and deputy mayor last year, to prevent poaching by rival parties.
