The Congress High command should realise that BJP was luring maximum number of legislators from its party. Already, 10 Congress legislators have joined the ruling party. The JD (S) State Unit President and MP H D Kumaraswamy had already submitted a CD containing visuals of BJP legislator offering huge money to the JD(S) legislators to join BJP, to Governor H R Bhardwaj. This is the best evidence for the Centre to dismiss the State government.

Chaluvarayaswamy said the chief justice of Karnataka High Court sharing the dais with Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa during Jamboo Savari procession in Mysore, has created confusion among people. The reason for it has been pending case pertaining to disqualification of eleven BJP legislators.

He also charged Assembly Speaker B G Bopaiah for his controversial judgement on the disqualification of MLAs and alleged that he was acting at the behest of the CM.

Â MLA M Srinivas, District JDS President D Ramesh, City Municipal President M P Arunkumar and others were present.ADVERTISEMENT
