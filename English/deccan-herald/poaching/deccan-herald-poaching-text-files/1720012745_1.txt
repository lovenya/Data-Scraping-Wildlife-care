Does that mean that Parameshwar has all the qualities which the high command were looking for? Only the performance of the newly nominated president will answer these questions. But one thing is clear - the high command has chosen a leader who is non-controversial. 

The selection has come when the party is struggling to keep its MLAs together with the ruling BJP continuing its ‘Operation Lotus’ to continue in power. 

So, he has a long list of challenges before him. He is appointed to the post at a time when the party is facing a major crisis of losing its MLAs to the Operation Lotus. 

The party, after poor performance in the successive elections, has to face Zilla Panchayat and Taluk Panchayat elections in a couple of months from now. The new president’s performance will be put to test in the elections. Parameshwar, speaking to media, listed his challenges.

‘Elite SC’

Parameshwar, who is considered as an ‘elite SC’, has a doctorate in Agricultural Science from Waite Agricultural Research Institute, University of Adelaide, Australia. He is married to Kannikaparameshwari, a homemaker. 

His son Shashank, 22, has completed his pilot training in New Zealand. His family owns many educational institutions across the State including Siddhartha Medical College in Tumkur. His father H M Gangadaraiah was an MLC. 

He has won thrice from Madhugiri in Tumkur. He shifted to Koratagere after Madhugiri was denotified as the SC reserved constituency. Parameshwar has over taken Shamanur Shivashankarappa, D K Shivakumar, H K Patil, B K Hariprasad in the race for the KPCC chief post. 

Here is an interaction with the new KPCC president: 

Did you expect this post?

For the last few days there had been information that the high command was considering me for the post. But I did not make any efforts to get the post. For me it is not a post, but a responsibility.

You are taking over the party when it is facing too many problems. Which is the first challenge? 

 The first challenge is to bring all leaders on a single platform and make them build the party together. The party has many senior leaders, who have a lot of experience and enthusiastic youths. I will try to bring both experience and enthusiasm together to strengthen the party.

It is alleged that the Congress has many enemies within the party and hence suffered defeats in the recent elections.

Even I have heard such comments. Addressing the internal differences within the party is my second challenge. 

What are your strategies for the upcoming ZP and TP elections?

 The party will work out an action plan. I will tour the State and make efforts to instill confidence among the party workers, who have been disappointed by the recent defeats. 

How will you stall your party MLAs being poached by the BJP?

It is difficult to keep the MLAs when they are offered huge money. I will appeal to the chief minister to stop buying our MLAs.ADVERTISEMENT
