Increasing aggression on the part of Trinamool in poaching party leaders has created bad vibes between both parties.Asked about Trinamool, a senior Congress leader told DH that any party would try to increase its area of influence and every party has a right to do so. "The point is one should be able to keep its people intact," the leader said.Also Read | Crack in TMC-Congress relationship widens as leaders join Mamata BanerjeeThe meeting would discuss a way out on this issue, sources said.
