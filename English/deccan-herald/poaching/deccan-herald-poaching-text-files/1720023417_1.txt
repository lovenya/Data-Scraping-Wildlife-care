As fans welcomed the homecoming of Salman Khan, actor and TV host Simi Garewal added a new twist to the 20-year-old blackbuck poaching case saying that the action hero did not pull the trigger.ADVERTISEMENT"Of one thing I am dead sure..@BeingSalmanKhan would NEVER EVER harm any animal. He loves them too much. The real culprit should be exposed. 20 years is too long to bear someone else's cross," she tweeted. 
  
Replying to a comment, she said: "The charity, the generosity etc of @BeingSalmanKhan is irrelevant here. What is all-important is the fact that he did NOT pull the trigger! He did NOT commit the crime. He is protecting someone for silly emotional reasons. Even at a HUGE cost to himself."
  
 Actor Varun Dhawan said that he was sure Salman would come out stronger. "I know for a fact that Salman bhai and his family have the utmost respect and faith in our judiciary system. @BeingSalmanKhan is one of the strongest and most genuine people  I know and I'm sure he will come out of this stronger.""Good deeds will always pay @BeingSalmanKhan a full justice finally. He has already been punished mentally for 20 years for his big mistakes n  still waiting for justice. God bless u salman @beinghuman," tweeted showman Subhash Ghai.
