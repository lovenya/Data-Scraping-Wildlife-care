Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit any university without security, even as more than a dozen political parties urged chief ministers of non-BJP states to suspend the process to update the National Population Register (NPR).ADVERTISEMENTBut the strategy meeting called by Congress President Sonia Gandhi to discuss Citizenship Amendment Act and student protests was given a miss by key allies DMK and Samajwadi Party, which took the sheen off Rahul's tirade and exposed the chinks in the Opposition armour.A joint statement issued after the meeting urged citizens to come out in large numbers to protect the Constitution on January 23 – birth anniversary of Netaji Subhaschandra Bose, January 26 – the Republic Day and January 30 – Mahatma Gandhi's death anniversary.In her opening remarks, the Congress President said the Modi-Shah government stood “completely exposed for its inability to govern and to provide security to the people”.“The real issue facing India today is the collapse of the economic activity and slowing growth … the Prime Minister and Home Minister have no answers and want to divert the nation's attention from this grim reality by raising one divisive and polarising issue after another,” Sonia said.Rahul launched a sharp attack on Modi, daring him to visit country's universities, which have been in turmoil, "without his police".“I challenge the Prime Minister right now, to go to any university, stand over there without his police, without his infrastructure and tell the people what he is going to do for this country,” Rahul told reporters."Unfortunately, the prime minister of the country does not have the guts to do this," Rahul said.Opposition meetOn Monday, several parties skipped the strategy meet called by Sonia.
