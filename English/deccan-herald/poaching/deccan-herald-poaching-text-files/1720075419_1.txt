That’s the difference," he said.Kharge sought to play down the non-attendance of Trinamool leaders saying that O'Brien has already told him that he would not be in Delhi. He also said NCP chief Sharad Pawar has also informed him about his inability to attend the meeting as he has to attend a marriage in Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's family.Congress and Trinamool Congress are at loggerheads after the latter started poaching its leaders. Last week, 12 out of 17 Congress MLAs in Meghalaya crossed over to Trinamool while two of its senior leaders Luizinho Faleiro and Sushmita Deb had joined the party earlier and were rewarded with Rajya Sabha berths.Trinamool supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also did not meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi last week despite being in the national capital for four days.Watch the latest DH Videos here:
