Hyderabad: Crisis managers of Congress in Telangana have made elaborate arrangements in Hyderabad to ‘host’ MLAs from Jharkhand. ADVERTISEMENTAs the political crisis deepened in Jharkhand, it was decided to shift MLAs of JMM and Congress coalition to Hyderabad to keep them ‘safe’ to thwart any attempts by BJP to poach them. However, due to poor visibility at Ranchi airport the chartered aircraft that was supposed to transport the MLAs could not take off and eventually the flight was cancelled. Around 50 rooms have been reserved at a plush and high end resort at Shameerpet on the outskirts of the city to host the MLAs. Luxury buses have also been readied to transport the MLAs from the airport.  These buses were kept at the Begumpet airport.
