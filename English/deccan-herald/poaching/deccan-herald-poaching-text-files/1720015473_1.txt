With poachers posing a massive threat to tigers in India, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has launched a pilot project in Uttarakhand’s Corbett National Park for round-the-clock surveillance of the park using high definition cameras.

ADVERTISEMENTThe project E-eye (electronic eye) is a software-based system where 10 high resolution thermal and infrared cameras mounted on a tower are spread across the 350 sq km area of the park that falls in a highly sensitive zone bordering Uttar Pradesh. 

The cameras capture image of objects weighing more than 20 kg and generate alerts if they are crossing the boundary. The alerts are sent to the control room in the park and the NTCA office in Delhi.

All the cameras have been placed in positions from where they cover the entire 350 sq km of the area and can be controlled by NTCA officials sitting in Delhi. 

Less field staff

According to the NTCA, due to shortage of field staff it was getting difficult to cover the entire 800 sq km of the Corbett and installation of cameras has brought down the incidence of infiltration in the area drastically.

The cost of the project is around Rs 3.5 crore. “It is for the first time in the world that a surveillance system of this type is being used in any national park. The project was launched some five-six months back to check poaching of tigers in the park,” deputy inspector general of forests and joint director of NTCA, S P Yadav said.

The cameras monitor the area 24X7 and send images even during the night. 

“It has helped in checking infiltration, poaching and illegal mining in the area. As soon as the control room receives alerts and images of people or vehicles inside the area, an alert team is sent to the location,” he said.
