He said the fishermen would return home either tonight or tomorrow.

The fishermen from Thangachimadam here, part of a group which had ventured into the sea, were arrested on the charge of trespassing and poaching in Sri Lankan waters, the second batch to be detained after 19 others were taken into custody on March 14.
The 19 fishermen were yesterday remanded to judicial custody till March 28 by a court in Thalaimannar in Sri Lanka.
