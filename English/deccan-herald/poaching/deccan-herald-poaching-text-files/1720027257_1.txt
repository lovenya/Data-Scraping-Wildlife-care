State BJP president B S Yeddyurappa stated on Friday that the longevity of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government would depend on the stand taken by more than 20 disgruntled Congress MLAs after the Lok Sabha election results.ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to reporters after meeting party leaders and workers here, Yeddyurappa said, “The BJP’s strength in Assembly will increase from existing 104 to 106 after Kundgol and Chincholi by-elections. Two independent MLAs will support the BJP. Infighting in the Congress-JD(S) alliance is out in the open. The coalition partners are worried about the impact of the results of the Lok Sabha elections and Assembly bypolls on the government. Let us wait and see on the moves by the disgruntled Congress MLAs after May 23,” he said.“Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy is staying in a resort. The coalition government is not responding to people’s problems. The political atmosphere in the state has spurred us to work enthusiastically,” Yeddyurappa added.‘BSY daydreaming’Meanwhile, KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao, who held a meeting of Congress and JD(S) leaders, stated that the coalition government would become stronger after May 23, as it would win both the seats, and the Congress-led alliance would come to power at the Centre.“Yeddyurappa is daydreaming of becoming the chief minister again. An SIT probe would bring out the truth in the audio gate. Yeddyurappa had offered a JD(S) MLA through his son Rs 20 crore to poach the MLA,” Dinesh added.
