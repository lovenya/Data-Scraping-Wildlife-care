These two masterchefs have been holding workshops and learning a lot about Indian cuisine by visiting the best hotels in the City and interacting with a number of Indian chefs. 

The two chefs recently held a workshop in European cuisine at the MSRCHM campus. Apart from the students of the college, the event was open to chefs, faculty and basically anyone interested in the field.

 It was business mixed with pleasure as the two chefs dabbled with an array of delicious Swiss dishes and organised vegetables, rice and meat on the plate at lightning speed. 

Some of the delicious dishes prepared by the chefs were Cream Of Pumpkin With Orange, Fillets Poached Turbot with Saffron, Tiger Prawns Provencal and Frozen Grand Marnier Souffle to name a few.

 The Roulade De Poulet, which consisted of skinless chicken wrapped in green zucchini and garnished with chopped vegetables looked like a sheer work of art. 

The two chefs were fascinated by Indian culture and cuisine. “There is so much variety in Indian kitchen,” said Chef Jerome. 

“My favourite is the ‘tandoor’ kitchen,” he added. While Chef Jean completely enjoyed the interactive activities that he had participated in. 

“Meeting the students, discovering the food of North and South India and interacting with the chefs and teachers was amazing. I simply loved biryani, dal and tandoori chicken,” he exclaimed. 

Said Neena Joshi, the HOD of Food Production in the college, “The workshop is based on Swiss cuisine, which also includes Italian, French and German cuisine. The emphasis today is on plate presentation.” She added, “It’s great to see so many people turning up here as industry participation is extremely important for the growth and development of the students.” 

The students, of course, enjoyed every bit of it. Denis George, a student whose parents teach at the college, had come all the way from Hyderabad for this programme. 

“A workshop like this is different and somewhat unexpected,” he smiled. While Daniel, a student specialising in Meditteranean cuisine, was extremely excited. 

“I never thought I would get an opportunity to learn classic European cuisine,” he gushed. The programme ended with an interactive session between the chefs and all those present. ADVERTISEMENT
