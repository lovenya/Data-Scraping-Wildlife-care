The police broke up the sit-in by taking into custody 70 Congress leaders, including former chief minister Siddharamaiah and PCC President R V Deshpande, some MLAs and other party workers.

The Congress leaders were in the midst of a meeting at a five-star hotel when the news of the resignation of party MLA S V Ramachandra reached them.

The leaders adjourned the meeting, went to the chief minister's official residence and staged the sit-in shouting slogans.Jagalur MLA Ramachandra submitted his resignation to Speaker K G Bopaiah.

However, when the Speaker's office did not respond to Congress' plea for a clarification, the party leaders led by Siddaramaiah and Dehspande staged the dharna in front of the Yeddyurappa residence.

Accusing BJP of reviving "operation lotus" to lure MLAs from opposition, Siddharamaiah alleged the Yeddyurappa government was mired in scams and warned if BJP tried poach Congress MLAs the ruling party has to face serious consequences.

BJP has been luring Congress and JD(S) MLAs in a bid to give stability to its government in the wake of uncertainty that loomed large over it after sixteen rebels, including 11 saffron legislators, challenged their disqualification as members of the Assembly by Bopaiah. The issue is pending before the state high court.

Meanwhile, the Speaker's office evaded a response on the issue of Ramachandra's resignation letter.ADVERTISEMENT
