An eight-year-old tiger was found dead at Kalkere Forest Range in Bandipur National Park on Thursday.

ADVERTISEMENTThe carcass was spotted when locals informed the Forest department staff about foul smell emanating near the stream in Mulehole forest area.

The tiger had sustained minor injuries on its head. 

Veterinary doctor Dr Nagaraju has taken the carcass for post mortem. Kumar Pushkar, Forest Conservator and Director of Bandipur National Park, and Paramesh, Forest Officer of Kalkare Forest Range arrived at the spot for inspection.
