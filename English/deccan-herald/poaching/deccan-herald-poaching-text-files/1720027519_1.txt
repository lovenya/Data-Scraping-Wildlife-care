Aam Aadmi Party leaders on Wednesday met Lieutenant Governor Naseeb Jung and asked him to withdraw the recommendation to allow the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form a government in Delhi. 

ADVERTISEMENT“You will recall in that meeting you had yourself asked us why we do not we produce any evidence by conducting a sting operation. We have precisely done that and with this letter we are enclosing a copy of the CD and an accompanying transcript of the sting conducted by us to prove our allegation,” the AAP leader said in the letter he submitted to the lieutenant governor. 

Kejriwal was referring to the meetings he and his MLAs had with the L-G. He released the letter to media later.  
“BJP Delhi state vice president Sher Singh Dagar attempted to bribe the AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar, Dinesh Mohania. It has been captured on camera and we are providing you the video CD of the sting which proves that Rs 4 crore was offered to Mohania to resign as an MLA,” the AAP’s letter stated. 

The party said that since the LG wanted a proof which could be produced before him he should now apprise the President of the happenings in last four days. 

Kejriwal also demanded that Jung should recommend dissolution of Delhi Assembly.
