Requested to extend support as a big brother. Srinivas Reddy joined the Congress for the welfare of Telangana farming community. The government will seek suggestions from him on farmers' welfare. Pocharam Srinivas Reddy will get due respect in future. The government will also seek his cooperation to complete all pending projects in Nizamabad district. My government is committed to farmers' welfare. We will seek the help of all for the welfare of farmers," said the chief minister after meeting the former Speaker.After it became clear that Srinivas Reddy switched sides, BRS workers staged a protest in front of his house in MLAs Colony.Reacting to the development, BRS said the chief minister was engaging in practices that he had condemned earlier.Â "Revanth's unconstitutional actions of poaching MLAs from other parties starkly contradict the principles of democracy championed by the late Rajiv Gandhi, particularly regarding the anti-defection law introduced during his tenure to preserve the values and integrity of the democratic process. It is ironic that Revanth Reddy, as TPCC president, who once vociferously decried political defections, now brazenly indulges in the same practices he previously condemned. This hypocrisy not only highlights his manipulative tendencies but also shows his disrespect to the legislative measures put in place by Rajiv Gandhi to prevent such political opportunism," said BRS leader Sravan Dasoju.
