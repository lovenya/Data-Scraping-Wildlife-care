Pala said in Shillong that the desertion of the 12 MLAs is not a setback for the party, it is a new challenge and the Congress leaders know how to face the challenge No irregularity in Cong MLAs' joining TMC, says Meghalaya speakerMeghalaya Assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh on Thursday said he is examining the letter written by 12 of the 17 Congress MLAs of the state informing him that they have joined the Trinamool Congress, and there is no irregularity in the matter.Lyngdoh said he has also received another letter from TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee who recognised the 12 legislators as members of his party.“I have received their letter and I am examining it. Whatever needs to be done will be done at the earliest,” Lyngdoh told journalists here. I feel it is a case of personal ambitions over the party ideology.
