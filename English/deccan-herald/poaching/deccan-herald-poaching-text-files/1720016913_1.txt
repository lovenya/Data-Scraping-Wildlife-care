Prince William wants all the ivory held by Britain's royal family, including a 19th century ivory throne from India, to be destroyed as part of his campaign against rampant elephant poaching.

ADVERTISEMENTThe second in line to the throne and one of the country's most high-profile wildlife campaigners told a leading primatologist that he would like to get rid of the ivory held as part of the royal collection of Buckingham Palace as a symbolic gesture.

Jane Goodall was quoted by 'The Independent' as saying she had spoken to Prince William and he had told her he would "like to see all the ivory owned by Buckingham Palace destroyed".

Goodall is famous for her 45-year study of the social interactions of wild chimpanezes.The royal family's extensive collection includes fans, miniatures and furniture such as the ivory throne from India dating back to 1851 which belonged to Queen Victoria. The throne has Indian elephant ivory plaques.

A palace spokesperson said they had received a small number of items since 1947 but said they were "primarily official gifts, which would have been agreed in full knowledge of relevant legislation".

While Kensington Palace said it did not comment on private conversations, the news comes days after a report had said William's father Prince Charles had asked for ivory items on display at his homes to be removed from view. The father-son duo had kicked off a high-profile campaign against the illegal trade in animal parts last week.

The 31-year-old Duke of Cambridge has launched a new coalition, United for Wildlife, made up of seven organisations determined to end the illegal wildlife trade.

"The forces that are currently destroying some of the world's most endangered species are sophisticated and powerful, but this week we are seeing the creation of an equally powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them," William had said.
