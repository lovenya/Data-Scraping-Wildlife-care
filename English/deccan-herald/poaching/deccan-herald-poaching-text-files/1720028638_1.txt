Disgruntled Congress MLA from Athani, Mahesh Kamatalli, who has associated himself with Ramesh Jarkiholi, was seen with Minister Satish Jarkiholi here on Saturday.ADVERTISEMENTKamatalli was seen with the minister at a programme to distribute sugarcane harvester to the beneficiaries in the city. The Athani MLA, who made his displeasure against the party leadership and the coalition government known in the open, had remained incommunicado for several weeks. The legislator had violated whip twice. He was said to have gone to Mumbai with Ramesh Jarkiholi.Replying to a query, Satish Jarkiholi said none of the 'rebel' Congress legislators, including Ramesh Jarkiholi would leave the party. All the four legislators had met the party leadership and clarified their stand. The BJP's Operation Kamala to poach the Congress legislators has failed, he added.
