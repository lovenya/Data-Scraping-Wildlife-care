KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao on Thursday said there was no threat to the Congress-JD(S) coalition, even as he continued to accuse the BJP of conspiring to topple the government.ADVERTISEMENT“Let the BJP indulge in immoral practices. We have nothing to worry about. The Congress and JD(S) are united. There is no reason to feel threatened,” Rao told reporters at a party event to commemorate the 76th anniversary of the Quit India movement. “The BJP’s sole agenda is to topple the government. Our government will go smoothly without any trouble,” he remarked. This comes amid the Congress’ allegation that the BJP, the single largest party in the Assembly with 104 members, was still trying to poach MLAs to stake claim to form the government.KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre went a step further to claim that some BJP legislators were willing to join the Congress. “Some of them are contacting us, but I can’t reveal anything more.”On the occasion, the party felicitated 101-year-old freedom fighter S V Manjunath, who took part in the Quit India movement in August 1942. Rao said there was need for another Quit India movement now, one that seeks to drive out ‘’hate and anger the BJP was spreading.”
