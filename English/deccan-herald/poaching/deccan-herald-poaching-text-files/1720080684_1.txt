While the Congress-JD(S) alliance is wary of its legislators being poached, the BJP, too, has a hawk eye on its flock amid speculation of counter-poaching.ADVERTISEMENTDuring the legislature session on Wednesday, news cameras caught a piece of paper being passed around by some BJP leaders. It had on it names of three BJP MLAs who did not show up - G Karunakara Reddy (Harapanahalli), Doddanagouda Patil (Hungund) and Channappa Mallappa Nimbannavar (Kalghatgi). A legislature party meeting will be held on Thursday morning before the commencement of the session and the party state president B S Yeddyurappa has directed all legislators to be mandatorily present.
