Faced with a daunting task of guarding party MLAs from being poached by the ruling BJP, newly appointed Karnataka Congress chief G Parameshwara today exuded confidence, saying no legislator would leave the party.

"We can say with confidence that none will leave the party. Our MLAs have confidence that whatever the problems they have, will be redressed," Parameshwara, who was with Congress leader Siddaramaiah, told reporters.

Parameshwara's comment came in the backdrop of speculations that some Congress MLAs were being lured by BJP. The Congress president met Siddaramaiah and said he would focus attention on carrying all party workers with him and gear up the party for upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections likely to be held by this year end.

An action plan would be drawn up to fight the coming elections and also against the BJP government, which he branded as "inefficient, corrupt and anti-development". He said he would also ask the party high command to appoint executive committee and other office-bearers to the state unit before the panchayat polls.

Meanwhile Siddaramaiah, who has been holding parleys with party MLAs and persuading them not to quit also expressed optimism that there would be no more desertions by legislators.ADVERTISEMENT
