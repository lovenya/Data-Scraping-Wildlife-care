NLFT cadre, who abducted two Mizos and an executive of the Delhi-based Telecom Network Solution Deep Mondal of West Bengal, demanded a ransom of Rs five crore for the release, Mizoram police officials today said.

ADVERTISEMENTThe abductors contacted the Telecom Network Solution officials and demanded Rs five crore for the release of Mondal while there has been no ransom demand for the two Mizos - Sanglianthanga, a taxi driver from Mizoram-Bangladesh-Tripura border Mamit and Lalzamliana of Aizawl, abducted along with Mondal, police said.

Sanglianthanga and Lalzamliana spoke to their relatives on mobile phones and said that they were guarded by ten to 20 armed insurgents and were treated well.

The abducted persons said that were kept in a thick jungle and have been shifted two times.

The three persons were abducted from a place near an abandoned Chikha Anti-Poaching Camp inside the Dampa Tiger Reserve adjoining Bangladesh-Tripura border by armed men on November 23.

They were taken to the thinly populated thick forest area near Zopui and Thangnang hamlets in Bangladesh by the captives, who are suspected to be NLFT cadres.

Meanwhile, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) or the Mizo Students federation and taxi drivers and pickup drivers associations undertook a march from Aizawl to Bangladesh border Tuipuibari called 'Remna Kawngzawh' (peace march) with around 40 people yesterday on foot.

The MZP and the two drivers association members were demanding the release of the three allegedly abducted by Bru goons operating in the border areas and handed over to the NLFT.

MZP President C Lalhmachhuana told PTI over phone that they spent the last night at Lengpui and left for Rawpuichhip this morning and were scheduled to arrive at Tuipuibari on December 11.
