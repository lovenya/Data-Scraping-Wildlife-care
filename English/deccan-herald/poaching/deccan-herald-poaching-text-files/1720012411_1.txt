The residents, in a press release said that Hebbe, Lakkavalli and N R Pura come in the core zone of Bhadra forest and they have found many signs of poachers laying traps to capture elephants here. They have asked the forest officials to wake up to the situation and take action to arrest the poachers. 

“The possibility of experienced poachers settling in reserve forest area cannot be ruled out. They are watching the move of the elephants and have studied the pattern of movement of tuskers. As a result, the trenches and pits are found in only those areas where the movement of tuskers is frequent,” the release said and added that trenches are covered with dried leaves so that nobody can identify it.

The residents say that hunting has been going on in Bhadra forest like a business. The hunters and poachers are reaching their destination by boats and oracles and forest officials have not been paying attention towards this.

As against the rule which states that as many as 8 watchers must be appointed in each anti hunting/poaching camps, there are only two daily wage labourers in the camps in the Bhadra forest. Some camps have been closed. 

Residents say that if situation continues in same manner, then Bhadra will soon lose its fame of being the best reserve forest in Asia.

What needs to be done
Residents have demanded that the trenches dug by poachers must be located and closed at the earliest. 

People who have migrated and settled around Bhadra reserve forest must be identified. 
Forest officials must go on patrol in the area frequently and all the 38 anti poaching camps must be made functional by providing adequate staff. 

Residents have said that most of the boats meant for forest officials to go on patrol on Bhadra back waters have been now given for VIP guests to enjoy sailing on water. 
These boats must be given back to forest department and the boats must be put back to its actual use, say the residents.
