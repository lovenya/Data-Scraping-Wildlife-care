People of Bihar can tolerate everything but they've never tolerated any deceit. In their last tenure, Nitish ji & BJP made several attempts (of horse-trading).They may try as much as they want but won't be able to poach any Congress or Mahagathbandhan MLA. All our elected representatives know their responsibilities & want to give something good to people of Bihar. I don't think any MLA of Mahagathbandhan will get lured.Be it MP, Goa, Manipur, Karnataka or any other state, BJP runs series of horse-trading to come to power. Confident there'll be no such situation in Bihar. Situation on ground will be clear tomorrow & Mahagathbandhan will form govt with thumping majority.
