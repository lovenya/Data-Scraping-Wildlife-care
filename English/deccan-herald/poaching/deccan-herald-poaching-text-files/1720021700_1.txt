UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and four of his ministerial colleagues would contest the by-polls for the state’s Upper House, circumventing the direct election route.ADVERTISEMENT Adityanath apart, the BJP central election committee on Wednesday nominated the two Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, besides ministers Swatantra Dev Singh and Mohsin Raz, for the September 19 by-polls. Deccan Herald reported on July 29 that the saffron party was poaching SP and BSP MLCs to pull them out of their Upper House seats for the Chief Minister and others. The six-month period for the five BJP leaders to become members of either of the Houses would end on September 19. The BJP’s strategy is to save the Chief Minister and others the trouble of contesting Assembly polls and instead allow them to focus on governance. SP members Jaswant Singh, Ashok Bajpayi, Sarojni Agarwal and Bukkal Nawab quit the Legislature Council though their tenure would end only in 2021. The membership of BSP’s Jaiveer Singh posed a tricky situation since his tenure would end in less than a year. However, the Election Commission –which notified the by-polls for the four vacant seats on August 29 and kept September 5 as the deadline for filing nominations- decided to hold the elections for the fifth seat as well. The results would be announced on September 19 at the end of the election. The BJP will now have to hunt candidates for Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats, respectively represented by Adityanath and Maurya who would quit their seats after becoming MLCs. Elections should be held to both the seats within six months from the date of quitting of the two MPs.
