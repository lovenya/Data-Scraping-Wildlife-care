A staggering 29,000 people have reportedly been arrested on drug-related matters since December 17, with allegations that some have been subjected to ill-treatment and torture.” 	The UN rights chief said the rights body was very concerned that authorities in Sri Lanka are adopting a heavily security-based response to the country’s drug problem. Security forces have reportedly conducted raids without search warrants, detaining suspected drug sellers and users, with hundreds sent to military-run rehabilitation centres, he said.Also Read:India sends submarine to Sri Lanka ahead of Chinese spy ship's visit to the MaldivesAlso Read:India sends submarine to Sri Lanka ahead of Chinese spy ship's visit to the MaldivesLast week, The Lawyers’ Collective, in a letter addressed to Alles, said that the manner in which the Minister was exercising his powers in Operation Yukthiya, the Anti-Drug Campaign, was “a matter of grave public concern.” 	 The group also insisted that “the campaign must conform to the Rule of Law.
