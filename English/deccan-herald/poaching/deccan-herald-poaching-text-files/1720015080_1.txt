"CBI has been empowered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to apprehend and prosecute wildlife offenders but hardly any case has been solved by them...There are only five officers at the national level. I concede this is an unfortunate situation," Environment and Forest Minister Jayanthi Natarajan said in the Lok Sabha.

She said during Question Hour that no case of poaching of rhinoceros and lions had been reported but there were five such cases of tiger poaching in the recent past.

Census of wild animals is undertaken by state governments concerned. The estimated population of rhinoceros in Assam in 2009 was 2,201, in West Bengal in 2011 it was 184 and in Uttar Pradesh in 2009 it was 29.

Other measures undertaken by the government include legal protection to wild animals and plants against hunting and commercial exploitation under the provisions of Wild Life (Protection) Act, forfeiture of any equipment, vehicle or weapon that is used for committing wildlife offence and schemes like Project Tiger and Project Elephant.ADVERTISEMENT
