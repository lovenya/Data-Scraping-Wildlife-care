Eight-seeded  Frysteberg and Matkowski won 4-6, 6-4, 6-10 on Saturday and will now  meet third seeds in Sunday’s final third seeds Max Mirnyi of Belarus and  Canadian Daniel Nestor who beat World No 1 pair Bryan twins, Bob and  Mike, in straight sets, 7-6 (6), 6-4 in the other semifinal.ADVERTISEMENTFourth  seeds and three-time former finalists Bhupathi and Paes, battled it out  for one hour and 39 minutes before bowing out playing together for the  last time on the Tour, having decided to split after this tournament.Both  teams gave little away until the 10th game of the first set, when  Bhupathi, serving at 4-5, fell to 30/40. He saved the set point by  dashing for a backhand volley winner that pierced the ‘Polish Power’  down the middle.However, Matkowski forced Bhupathi  into a volley error at sudden death deuce to clinch the first set 6-4  after 39 minutes of play. Fyrstenberg and Matkowski won all 11 of their  first service points and 20 of 27 overall.In the  second set, Paes found himself at 15/40 in game two. The Indians  remained in control of the point until Fyrstenberg changed the pace of  the rally by hitting a lob down the line.It caught Paes off guard. Scrambling back to the baseline, he hit a short lob that Fyrstenberg smashed away for a 2-0 lead.Bhupathi  and Paes responded immediately by winning three straights games,  including a sudden death deuce point at 2-2, 30/40, when Matkowski hit  the Poles’ third double fault of the match.Two more  service breaks were exchanged, before Bhupathi and Paes decisively broke  at 4-4, when Bhupathi hit a low return to the feet of a net-rushing  Matkowski, only for Paes to poach a forehand volley that gave  Fyrstenberg no chance of keeping the rally alive. Paes closed out the  46-minute set with a hold to 15.Bhupathi and Paes  looked to be in control at 3-0 lead in the Match tie-break, but the  Poles took their chances on return of serve to win nine of the next 11  points.At 5-5, Paes mis-timed a forehand volley off  Bhupathi’s serve, giving Fyrstenberg an easy forehand into space.  Fyrstenberg took advantage of the lapse in concentration with two quick  service points.’Polish Power’ ended up winning one point fewer (64) than the ‘Indian Express’ (65) overall.Winning  33 of 35 first service points, Mirnyi and Nestor beat top seeds and  three times champions Bryan brothers for a title-shot at the Barclays  ATP World Tour Finals.“If you could reproduce it every time it would be no fun,” Mirnyi told atpworldtour.com.“We  know it won’t happen every time. We knew we had to serve well against  Bob and Mike, so we went after our serves and attacked any first volley  above the net.”Mirnyi and Nestor, who went 3-0 in Group B round-robin play, are both former champions at the year-end championship.Mirnyi  has an 18-13 record, including a title run in 2006 with Jonas Bjorkman,  while Nestor is a three-time titlist, winning in 2007 with Mark Knowles  and with Nenad Zimonjic in 2008 and 2010.
