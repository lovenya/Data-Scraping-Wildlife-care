The Congress and the JD(S), which have come together to form a coalition government, are likely to shift their MLAs to a resort in order to prevent poaching from the BJP.ADVERTISEMENTSpeculation is rife in the political circles that the BJP is planning an “Operation Lotus” to increase its numbers. Under Operation Lotus, rival party MLAs will be made to resign and face the byelections after joining its fold. The saffron party had done this after it fell short of simple majority in the 2008 Assembly polls.The Congress and the JD(S), therefore, may ferry their MLAs to a resort outside Karnataka. “The party leaders (Congress) are holding a meeting in this regard tonight. All the MLAs are likely to be kept at a resort till the coalition government is formed,” sources in the Congress said.Senior Congress leader D K Shivakumar is said to have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that there is no poaching of the MLAs. Shivakumar had prevented poaching of the party MLAs from Gujarat last year ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls by keeping them at a resort near Bidadi on the outskirts of Bengaluru.The Congress has convened its legislature party meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the political developments. The MLAs are likely to be later ferried to a resort, the sources said."The BJP is known for poaching of MLAs. It had done it successfully in the past. But, this time it will not succeed," out-going Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told reporters.The Congress and the JD(S) together have 118 MLAs, including two Independents. The BJP has 103 MLAs. Currently, the simple majority to form the government is 112.
