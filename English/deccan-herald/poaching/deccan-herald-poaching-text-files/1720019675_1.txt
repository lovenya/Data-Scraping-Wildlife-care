Actor Salman Khanâ€™s former driver, Harish Dulani, a prime witness in the Chinkara poaching case of 1998 in which High Court of Rajasthan acquitted the actor, on Friday wrote a letter to the state home minister seeking protection. 

ADVERTISEMENTOn Thursday, State Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria had told the media that protection will be provided to the driver, who had gone missing and resurfaced on Wednesday, if he asked for it in writing. 

Promptly, Dulani wrote a letter to the Home minister in which he clearly mentioned that his life is at risk and he has been threatened numerous times. 

The letter, which was faxed to the Home Minister read, "During all these years I and my family have been receiving threats. Many times I was forced to leave the state. I request the government of Rajasthan to ensure safety to me and my family members.

 I am worried because the third (poaching) case is yet to be decided and I am a prime witness in that as well." 

Dulani was reported to be missing since 2002, which weakened the prosecution's case against Khan.

Meanwhile, the Rajasthan Government constituted a five-member committee on Friday to decide on going on appeal against the HC verdict in the Supreme Court, Rajkumar Rinwa, Minister of Forest and Environment, said.

Rajasthan High Court on Monday acquitted Salman Khan in two poaching cases after overturning earlier verdicts that had sentenced him to jail. Salman was accused of killing a blackbuck and a chinkara in two separate incidents in 1998. Justice Nirmaljeet Kaur of Jodhpur principal seat of the High Court pronounced the verdict.
