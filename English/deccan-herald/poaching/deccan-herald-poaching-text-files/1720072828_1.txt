Congress has given me ample opportunities and there is not a single moment that I regret. I have no grievances against Sonia-ji and Rahul-ji," she added.Asked why she chose Trinamool, Sushmita said in politics, one does not work alone and that one has to think about people, party and supporters. "There is a larger picture to look at rather than trying to dig up dirt," Sushmita, who would be touring Assam and Tripura in the next two weeks, said.When asked whether Sushmita's "poaching" by Trinamool would have an impact on Opposition unity, O'Brien said, "Trinamool do not break, poach. We are not into breaking or poaching. But if there are good, talented people who share the vision and dream of Mamata Banerjee, we welcome them."He said on August 20, the Congress president has called a meeting and he can reconfirm that the West Bengal Chief Minister would join the meeting along with leaders from other political parties. In Parliament, he said, one has seen the Opposition working together and every one among them has a different relationship.O'Brien also said that the party had taken a "path-breaking" decision on Monday to implement "one person, one post" policy in the party, which will give "opportunity for more people" in the party.Asked whether Mamata would also follow the policy as she now holds both the top post in the party and the government, O'Brien said, "Mamata Banerjee is the founding chairperson of the party and she is a worthy exception. She wanted 'one leader, one post' for herself as well but all of us forced her to remain in both the posts as she is the founder Chairperson of the party."He also referred to a survey conducted by a media group which claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity has dropped from 66% nine months ago to 24% now and said that the "key reason" behind it was the "whipping, thrashing and humiliation, the scathing defeat" the BJP was handed over by Mamata Banerjee-led Bengal.
