The task force will make recommendations for improving the condition of these tiger reserves. “Simlipal Tiger Reserve in Orissa has been selected for the pilot project,” Ramesh added. 

He said a Wildlife Conservation and Management Amendment Bill would be introduced in the next budget session to ensure stringent penalty measures against the law breakers. 
“The bill will have punishment measures equivalent to the money laundering and foreign exchange law,” Ramesh said.

The minister also underlined the need to strengthen policing across international borders with Nepal and Myanmar to check tiger poaching.ADVERTISEMENT
