Stray rhinos from the north bank (Orang National Park) and eastern side (Kaziranga) were known to enter through the Brahmaputra chapori areas but never stayed for long," she said.Ghosh said rhinos have been "sighted in the first addition of Burachapori and Laokhowa wildlife sanctuaries since last November".Both the rhinos have entered probably "through the second addition of Orang National Park and the recently restored (evicted areas) of Arimari", she said.Other than rhinos, the protected area also has 10 tigers.The eviction drive was carried out from February 13 to 15 last year, which led to a clearing of 1,282 hectares of forest land and 817 hectares of unsurveyed government land.Ghosh said 75 frontline positions, including that of deputy ranger, have been filled up in the area, reaffirming the government's commitment to strengthen the landscape and restore the lost glory of the forest.
