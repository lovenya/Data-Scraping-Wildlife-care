BJP MLA K S Eshwarappa, on Friday, said that BJP will not lure any MLAs of either Congress or JD(S). The days of the coalition government are numbered and it will collapse on its own, he added.ADVERTISEMENTEshwarappa, who is in Mysuru to tour three districts ahead of the urban local bodies elections, spoke to reporters, here.Replying to Water Resources Minister D K Shivakumar’s allegation that five BJP leaders have been trying to poach Congress MLAs, Eshwarappa said that Congress MLAs were weak. "Congress has no faith in its own MLAs. The coalition government is counting days and BJP will form the government soon," he remarked.“We (BJP) will never try to buy MLAs from another party. BJP’s 104 MLAs are like ‘lions’ and we don't need MLAs from another party,” he averred.Eshwarappa accused the ministers of Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy’s cabinet of making money in transfers of officials. “These ministers act like agents in the transfer of the government officials,” Eshwarappa alleged.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had introduced several schemes for the development of farmers and the backward classes. “We are touring the state to popularise the development activities of the Union government. It was Modi who announced support prices for 12 crops and he should be the PM for another term,” Eshwarappa noted.
