Age is only a number and sightings are by sheer luck for the volunteers in the three-day elephant census.
A S Krishnamurthy, a 59-year-old banker from Mysuru, is among those who proved that age is just a number.

 He had planned to participate in the census with his son. But since the latter did not get leave, Krishnamurthy is doing it independently, but with enormous energy and enthusiasm. This is his third census. 

Krishnamurthy is staying in the anti-poaching camp at Maralahalla in Kaddamatturkatte. “My age does not stop me and the forest officials are convinced of my health as I gave them my medical certificate,” he said. 

There are two to three more people like him in the two prime tiger reserves of Karnataka - Bandipur and Nagarahole - for the census. After doing a head count of the elephants on Day One, the staff and volunteers were busy counting and assessing the elephant dung on Day Two. 

Animesh Das from Kolkata, who works in a software firm in Bengaluru, said he took four days’ leave for the census. Not sighting any elephant has not disappointed him. He is excited about learning and living the life of a forest guard.
