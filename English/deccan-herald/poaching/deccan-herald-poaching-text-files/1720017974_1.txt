Seems like actor Salman Khan cannot take a sigh of relief anytime soon as far as his court cases are concerned.

ADVERTISEMENTWell, adding to the star's woes, the Jodhpur court on Thursday turned down his plea to produce former DCP and DM of Mumbai as a witness in the case filed against him for violation of Arms Act.

Salman has been accused of possessing arms with expired license and using the same guns for poaching blackbucks in Jodhpur on Oct 1, 1998.

The defense lawyer had filed a petition in the court on Tuesday stating that the license of Salman's guns, back then, had not expired.

The defense lawyer also produced a notice that was issued to Salman on September 29, 1999Â  by the then DCP and DM of Mumbai, questioning the actor as to why his license should not be cancelled. 

By producing the notice issued by the then DCP before the court, Salman's lawyer wanted to prove that the license of the guns had not expired in 1998.

However, the public prosecutor opposed it stating that the notice had nothing to do with the expiry date of the guns. It was regarding the suspension of license.

Following the arguments of the public prosecutor, the Jodhpur court rejected Salman's plea to summon the then DCP and DM as a witness in his case.
