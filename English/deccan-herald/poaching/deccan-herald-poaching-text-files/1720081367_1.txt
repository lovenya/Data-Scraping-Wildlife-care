With 10 days to go for the counting of votes possed in the state assembly polls, state Bharatiya Janata Party chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Monday said that the BJP would not poach any elected legislator this time round, because the party was confident of forming a government and getting elected with a full majority.ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to reporters in Panaji, Tanavade also said that the Congress had already appeared to have conceded defeat in the February 14 polls, by accusing the BJP of trying to poach its winnable candidates."People who know they will not be able to form a government make these kinds of statements. If they really were in a position to form a government, they would not have made such statements. They are afraid that they will not be able to form a government therefore they are trying to ensure that their (MLAs) do not switch parties," Tanavade told reporters.Also Read: Even before votes are counted, Goa Congress accuses BJP of poaching its candidates"Do not worry.
