Daily wage workers working in Anti-Poaching Camp (APC) who were promised payment of Rs 5,000 per month by Bhadra Wildlife Division Deputy Conservator of Forest Gaonkar are due to receive the payment since a year now.

ADVERTISEMENTThese workers are finding it difficult to make their both ends meet. There are seven camps at Hipla, Kesave, Uddinakatte, Madalagodu, Kaske, Karanji and Kavikalgandi. Though there is scope to have five to six workers in every camp, only one or two have been employed.

 However, on records each camp had five persons working. With this the officials have been eking out massive amount by drawing salary of Rs 5,000 per worker. When questioned, no official holds an appropriate answer. 

The workers who know it very well that it is the lower level officials who are not letting the amount reach them, say that the order of the senior official of paying Rs 5,000 per worker must be implemented at the earliest.

The workers further complain that the rice supplied to the camps is of poor quality due to which most of the workers are suffering from health disorders.

Sources inform that since the officials had tried to depute these workers to work on ‘Fire Line’ three workers from Hebbe Zone have already quit the job. “To do the fire line work workers should be brought in private vehicle, from Kalenahalli to the region but here the Wildlife Division vehicles are being used for the same,” says a source.
