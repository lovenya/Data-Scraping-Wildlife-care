Two tiger cubs have been spotted in the Sariska Tiger Reserve, situated in the Alwar district of Rajasthan, about 110 km from here.

ADVERTISEMENT"Two cubs of tigress ST-2 have been found Saturday night via camera traps," R.S. Shekhawat, conservator of forest and field director, Sariska Tiger Reserve, told IANS over phone Sunday.
The cubs appear to be three-four months old.

With these cubs, the total strength of tigers in Sariska has touched 11 with nine adults.

It may be mentioned here that in 2004-05, the forest department and the Rajasthan government faced all-round criticism over the disappearance of tigers from Sariska.

Poaching was the cause behind the tigers being wiped out.

Facing flak from various quarters, the state government decided to relocate tigers from the Ranthambore National Park in the Sawai Madhopur district of the state to Sariska. In all, seven tigers have been shifted till now.

The Sariska reserve, originally a hunting preserve of the erstwhile princely state of Alwar, was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. It got the National Park status in 1979.

The total area of the park is 866 sq km. Leopards, jungle cats, hyenas, jackals, chitals, sambars, langurs, wild boars, four-horned deer and many bird species are found here.
