Forests and Environment Minister Satish Jarkiholi admitted on Tuesday three to four MLAs in the Congress were not happy with the party, but they crossing over to the Opposition BJP would not have any bearing on the coalition government.ADVERTISEMENTAs claimed in the media, if the BJP has 16 MLAs from other other parties with them, why was it not coming forward to form the government, he questioned.Speaking to reporters here, Jarkiholi said BJP
had been trying to poach MLAs of the Congress-JD(S) coalition for the past seven months, but its efforts had gone in vain.The minister said the BJP would not be able to form the government in the state.“It has confined its MLAs in Delhi as it fears that some of them could quit the party,” Jarkiholi said.He refused to comment on reports that Arabhavi MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi of BJP was luring Gokak MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi to the saffron fold.
