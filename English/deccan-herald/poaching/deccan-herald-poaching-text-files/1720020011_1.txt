Two days after the High Court of Rajasthan acquitted actor Salman Khan in two chinkara (antelope) poaching cases, the driver of the Gypsy, Harish Dulani, appeared before the media. 

ADVERTISEMENTDulani, an important witness in the 18-year-old case, told the media that he and his family had been threatened and that he stands by his earlier statement that 'Salman Shot the chinkaras'. 

Dulani said on Wednesday that he is not an absconder but he failed to testify in the court as his family had been threatened. Dulani, who drove the actor for a week and was also driving the Gypsy during the hunt in 1998 during the shoot of Hum Saath Saath Hain, had been missing since 2002. His absence in the court proceedings weakened the prosecution's case as mentioned in the court judgment pronounced on July 25.    Dulani told media that he is ready to go to the court and testify. He said he had received numerous threats which made him shift his house and also was sacked by the car company that hired him to drive the Gypsy. 

Actor Salman Khan has been acquitted in the two poaching cases. Rajasthan High Court on Monday over-turned the earlier verdicts that sentenced him to jail. Justice Nirmaljeet Kaur pronounced the verdict.
