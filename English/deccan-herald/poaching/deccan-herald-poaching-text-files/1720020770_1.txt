At a time when violence has engulfed Kashmir, fresh differences have erupted between the ruling allies PDP and BJP, pushing the state into further trouble.

While trouble started after the saffron party defeated the PDP in one seat during the recently held Legislative Council elections, BJP minister Prakash Chander’s statement that “bullets were the only way to deal with stone pelters” has added fuel to the fire.

“They (stone pelters) are traitors. Whether they have come from Pakistan or live here, there is only one remedy for them and that is bullets. And if not bullets, they should at least be beaten with sticks (by forces). Take my word, next time they won’t throw stones,” Chander is seen saying in a video clip, which has gone viral on social networking sites.

Senior PDP leader Sartaj Madni strongly condemned Chander’s statement, saying such “disgusting utterances” are not only unjustifiable, but also perilous. “It is unbecoming of a senior minister in the government to dish out such a sweeping, sickening and intimidating statement against the Kashmiri youth,” Madni, who is also Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle, said.

The PDP was already angry with its alliance partner over its “betrayal” in the elections, where it suffered a setback after independent MLA Baqir Rizvi, whom it was banking on, voted for the BJP candidate.

Of the six seats, the BJP ended up winning three, while the PDP, Opposition National Conference and Congress won one seat each. Upset with the BJP for “poaching” Rizvi, the PDP had said “it wasn’t a positive thing to have happened”.ADVERTISEMENT
