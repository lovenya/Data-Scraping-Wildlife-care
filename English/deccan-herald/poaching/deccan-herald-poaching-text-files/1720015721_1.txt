The State Congress has threatened to launch a State-wide agitation if the government executes BJP state president K S Eshwarappa’s statements in principle.

ADVERTISEMENTThe Congress flayed Eshwarappa’s recent statement and termed that by giving a call to the Education Department to ‘saffronise’ the school curriculum, he was attempting to flare up communal emotions. 

Addressing the media in Bangalore on Thursday, KPCC president G Parameshwara said his party would also petition Governor H R Bhardwaj on the matter, as Eshwarappa’s call to infuse Hindutva ideology in the education sector stood against the principles of the Constitution. 

He appealed to the Government to work towards the empowerment of people belonging to all sections of society.

Replying to questions pertaining to cross-voting by his party MLAs in the recently concluded MLC elections, Parameshwara said disciplinary action will be initiated against those who were found guilty. 

Defending the party’s decision to field the fourth candidate despite much opposition from members within the party, Parameshwara said it was a collective decision, and that it would not be fair to hold any one individual responsible for this decision.

When asked about speculations regarding poaching of votes by fourth candidate M R Seetharam, the Congress leader said that if these allegations were proven, then the party will initiate action against Seetharam too. Parameshwara said the party was yet to take a decision on naming the leader of the party in the Legislative Council. 

He said the announcement would be made after the opinion of the party MLCs were sought and a decision was arrived at.
