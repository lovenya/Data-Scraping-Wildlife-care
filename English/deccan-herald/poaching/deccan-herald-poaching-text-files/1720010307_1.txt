The picturesque Bandipur National Park in Chamarajanagar, home to over 70 tigers and 3,000 AADVERTISEMENT<img src="https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2F2009%2F06%2F29%2Fspec30bandipur.jpg?w=1200" alt=""/>sian elephants, along with leopards, dholes, gaur and sloth bears, is no longer a sanctuary for wildlife. The alarming increase in traffic on two national highways, Gundlupet-Ooty (NH-67) and Gundlupet-Wayanad (NH-212), is taking a heavy toll on wildlife in this ‘protected’ forest area bordering Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The total length of NH-67 in Karnataka is 12.5 kms, while NH-212 is 17.5 kms in the state. Both these NHs pass through the core forest zone in Bandipur.

Wildlife badly hit, says survey
A recent survey conducted by D Rajkumar of the Wildlife Conservation Foundation has revealed that an average of three animals are being hit or crushed to death every month due to overspeeding by goods transport vehicles during night on these routes. As many as 91 animals, 94 birds and 56 snakes, a majority of them endangered species, have been brutally killed on these roads between 2004 and 2007. These include tigers, an elephant, three sloth bears, two leopards, 19 spotted deer and 11 bonnet macaques.
“The non-stop vehicular movement is disturbing wildlife. The number of animals being killed due to road accidents is more than the number of those poached in a year. These two NHs have become deathtraps,” Rajkumar says. 

Mixed reactions to ban
This, in fact, prompted the Chamarajanagar district administration to act, by closing the two National Highways during the night recently, between 9 pm and 6 am. The order was issued on June 3. Though the ban on vehicular movement on the NHs brought smiles to the faces of environmentalists, this eco-friendly move did not go down well with transporters and traders. 
Charamarajanagar, Mysore, Mandya and Hassan districts of the state have turned into veritable vegetable markets for traders from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 

They buy vegetables in these places in Karnataka every day and sell them in their states. An average of 400 vehicles carrying vegetables ply on NH-67 and NH-212 every night.
“Farmers harvest crops (vegetables) in the morning and bring the produce to markets by noon. The traders then buy vegetables through auctions till late in the evening and transport the goods to their states in the night. Thousands of people are dependent on this business for several years now. The ban, if implemented, will not only hit the traders, but hundreds of farmers also,” Narayan Prasad, president of the Chamarajanagar Truck Owners’ Association, argues.

Traders in Kerala have taken up the issue seriously and have protested the ban. Even elected representatives in Kerala intervened on the issue. Krishnaprasad, MLA from Sultan Battery in the Wayanad district of Kerala, rushed to Bangalore and met Chief Minister Yeddyurappa.

Ban withdrawn
The chief minister directed Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner Manoj Kumar Meena to withdraw the order on-the-spot,  apparently to avoid yet another inter-state row. 
The deputy commissioner withdrew his order on June 10, the day the ban should have actually come into effect.

“The only intention behind banning vehicular movement in the night was to protect wildlife. Apart from animals being killed, the entire biodiversity of the forest is being disturbed in a big way by heavy movement of vehicles. Nobody is complying with the rules that stipulate maximum speed limit at 40 km/hour in the forest area. Human beings can find alternatives to any problem, but not animals. In fact, we should feel proud of our wildlife and take steps to protect them,” Meena says.

Nearly 50 per cent of goods transport vehicle drivers indulge in drunken driving in the forest, which was recently declared the Core Critical Tiger Habitat, points out R Raju, Deputy Conservator of Forest, Bandipur National Park. The unregulated traffic on the NHs has posed a huge problem to the whole Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Bandipur is part of it), he says.

“Cold blooded animals like snakes sleep on the asphalted road seeking warmth in the night. And they get crushed under the wheels. So, instead of these NHs, truckers can take an alternate route to reach both TN and Kerala in the night. They are: Mysore-Hunsur-Periyapatna-Virajpet-Kalpetta and Mysore-Chamarajanagar-Satyamangala-Ooty routes. These alternate routes are just a few kms more compared to the NHs,” Raju adds.

Truckers seek alternatives to ban
But transporters do not agree. “The transport vehicles are heavy-duty vehicles. The alternate routes are very narrow and the condition of roads is bad. Moreover, the cost of transportation will increase. Truck owners charge Rs 20 per km. If the travel distance increases by 50 kms, the cost of transport for the trader goes up by Rs 1,000. This will have a cascading effect on both farmers and consumers,” Prasad argues.

Not that the transporters are heartless and unsympathetic about the wildlife. A cross-section of drivers and lorry owners Deccan Herald interacted with both in Karnataka and Kerala said steps need to be taken to protect killing of animals on the NHs. 

“We have no problem if the government takes tough measures to regulate traffic in the night for the safety of wildlife. But a complete ban on vehicular movement on these routes will hit us (drivers and lorry owners) hard,” Galib, owner and driver of a truck explains.
The Forest department has already worked out a plan to regulate traffic. It will soon put up speed breakers, launch intense patrolling and identify wildlife corridors to ensure safety for animals, the Deputy Commissioner said.
