In a memorandum, Prabhu said that there is a need to solve the elephant menace problem with foresight and planning. He said that 6 lakh hectare of land has been affected by the rogue tuskers and several people have lost their lives in wild elephant attacks. 

He said injustice has been meted out at 300 tribal families in Nagarahole while finalising Rs 10 lakh package for tribals. He urged the minister to chalk out transparent, open programmes which are lawful in nature so as to avert rehabilitation centres becoming centres of uncertainty.

He informed that in Nagarahole illegal and anti social activities has been going on unabated. “ Smuggling of woods, poaching etc has been going on fearlessly in Nagarahole. There is a need to appoint an efficient and able forest officer to the region and save the lives of animals, tribals and woods,” he added.
