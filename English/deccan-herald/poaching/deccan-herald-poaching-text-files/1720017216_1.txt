Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking laying down of a time-bound action plan to achieve a "long-term, permanent solution to the problem and also to put in place a strong and robust diplomatic response" to the issue arrest of the Indian fishermen by Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa last month had ordered the release of Indian fishermen as a goodwill gesture. He had attended the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 26 in Delhi.

Talks between India and Sri Lanka on the fishermen issue had ended in a deadlock early last month and negotiators are scheduled to meet again this month.

Sri Lanka had shot down a request from Tamil Nadu fishermen to allow fishing in Lankan waters for 70 days a year and to allow bottom trawling.
