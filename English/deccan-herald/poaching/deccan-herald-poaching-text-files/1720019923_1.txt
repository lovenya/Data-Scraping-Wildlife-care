The Rajasthan government on Tuesday filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against acquittal of Bollywood actor Salman Khan in two chinkara poaching cases. 

On the sidelines of an event held in Jaipur, State Law Minister Rajendra Rathore told the media, "The government was studying the documents and evaluating its merits and demerits. Government then decided to move the Supreme Court against the decision."

The Rajasthan High Court's Jodhpur bench had on July 25 last, acquitted the actor in two cases of chinkara (black buck) poaching in Jodhpur, observing that the statement of a key witness could not be considered as he had "disappeared" and the defence could not cross-examine him during the trial. 

Justice Nirmaljeet Kaur of Jodhpur principal seat of the High Court pronounced the verdict. The High court held that the pellets recovered from the chinkaras were not fired from Salman's gun as investigation revealed that they did not match.

The 50-year-old actor had appealed to the Rajasthan HC against a lower court verdict that convicted him in both the cases, sentencing him to one year and five years’ imprisonment on February 17, 2006 and April 10, 2006 respectively.  Hearing of both the petitions by the HC had begun on November 16, 2015 and completed on May 13, 2016. Thereafter, Justice Nirmaljit Kaur had reserved her judgement.

 After the 2006 sentencing, Salman had spent a week in jail in Jodhpur before being granted bail. A third case of alleged poaching of endangered black buck by the actor is yet to be decided in Rajasthan. Khan, along with his co- actors, was in Jodhpur for the shooting of movie Hum Saath Saath Hain when the incident took place.
