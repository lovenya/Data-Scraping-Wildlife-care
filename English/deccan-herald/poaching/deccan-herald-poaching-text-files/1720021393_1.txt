Fear of a backlash from voters back home looms large among Gujarat Congress legislators in Bengaluru whose constituencies have been ravaged by floods.

Most of the legislators are averse to venturing on sightseeing trips which they had planned earlier as they feel that this would affect their image back home. They remained confined the resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru on Tuesday. Six legislators are from Banaskantha district in north Gujarat, severely affected by floods.

As many as 43 MLAs were ferried to Bengaluru on Saturday on the fear that they would be poached by the BJP ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections scheduled for August 8. According to sources, several legislators are insisting that they be sent back to Gujarat.

At the resort, Naushad Parmar and Suresh Sharma of Jawaharlal Nehru Leadership Institute, New Delhi, conducted classes for the legislators on various issues. The topics that were discussed included ‘What the Congress achieved in 60 years’, ‘Media truths and social media transparency’, ‘Truth on corruption in UPA government’.  There was also a session on team work.
Energy Minister D K Shivakumar, who has been looking after the MLAs at the resort, left for New Delhi to participate in a meeting of an advisory group on renewable energy integration in states, organised by Niti Aayog. According to sources, he is likely to brief the party high command on the mood of the legislators and the developments in Bengaluru.

Shivakumar’s brother, D K Suresh, who is the Bengaluru Rural MP, MLCs N Ravi and C M Lingappa are now looking after the logistics at the resort. The legislators, for their part, are waiting for further instructions from the high command.
