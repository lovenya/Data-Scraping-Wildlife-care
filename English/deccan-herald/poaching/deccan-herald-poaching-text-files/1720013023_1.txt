The Centre has allocated Rs 1.94 crore this year for holistic development of KMTR, considered one of the delicate ecological bio-spheres in the Western Ghat range.
Utilising the fund, various measures, including setting up of anti-poaching squads, providing compensation to farmers for crop damage caused by wild animals in fringe areas of the reserve, had been taken up this year, he said.

Laying of proper roads and construction of bridges along this ecological bio-sphere, demarcating the protected reserve forests by powered fencing to prevent entry of wild animals into the farm lands were among other steps taken this year.

The fund has been provided by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, he said.
KMTR is situated in the southern most tip of the Western Ghat range, spread across the intervening borders of Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts adjoining Kerala.
A trust had been formed in the name of Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tigers Protection Organisation with its executive committee headed by Mallaesappa.

As continuous funding was required for implementing the development measures, the trust has appealed to public and industrialsts to contribute to a corpus fund.ADVERTISEMENT
