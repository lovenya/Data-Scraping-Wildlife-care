The film is tentatively titled "Anna Salman" or "Brother Salman", but the producer is yet to zero in on an actor to play Salman. 

"I am still looking for a hero to play Salman's role. The film is not based on Sallu bhai's life, it is only vaguely inspired by it. We all love Salman Khan and his movies. When I read the script, I immediately decided to do the movie," Krishnan said in a statement. 

Sources said that the script has similar incidents like the Bandra bakery accident and the Black Buck poaching case. However, the hero is shown as a good character, who lands up at a wrong place at the wrong time and messes up his life. 

The film would also show that the hero also has a torrid relationship with a young actress - an apparent reference to Salman Khan's troubled past relationship with Aishwarya Rai, to be played out by Rittu Sachdev. 

"Out and out, the film is a comedy and the hero comes out of his troubles triumphant and much loved by everyone, in spite of the initial bad phase," said Krishnan.ADVERTISEMENT
