Addressing the gathering during the felicitation ceremony organised by the Dr Prabhakar Kore Abhinandana Samiti to mark his 65th birthday in Bangalore on Wednesday, Kore said the BJP government led by Gowda should make committed efforts in this regard.

Former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa had earlier requested Gowda to set up a convention centre, which could accommodate at least 3,000 people, in the City, notwithstanding the overcrowding in Ravindra Kalakshetra, which was the venue.

Kore, however, had a different take. “People in Bangalore maybe in need of seating arrangements, but the people of North Karnataka are deprived of even drinking water. The government should focus on the development of these districts,” he said.

Kore, who hails from Ankali village in Belgaum district, became the chairman of KLE Society 26 years ago. A member of the Congress for nearly 40 years, he was poached by the BJP during the Rajya Sabha elections in 2008.

Gowda said Kore’s mammoth support had given the BJP a big boost. KPCC president G Parameshwara, who was also present at the function, said he took part in the function despite it being a “BJP affair” because of his bonding with Kore. “He is like my brother. That is the only reason I am here,” he added.
