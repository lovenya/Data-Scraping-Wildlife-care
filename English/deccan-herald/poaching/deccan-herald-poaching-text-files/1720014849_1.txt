Dazzlingly beautiful, Katrina Kaif has been voted the sexiest woman time and again and her perfect figure is desired by millions. Now she is on ‘India’s Glam Diva’ to talk about life, movies and her journey to the top.

When asked about how she maintained her hot body, she said, “I try to exercise whenever I can. I do try to eat in moderation. I eat healthy food and sometimes I even eat pizzas, ice creams and cakes but that’s ok occasionally, as you should not deprive your body of anything.”

Though she started off as a model, Katrina never had a super skinny body like other models. She says, “I have never been a skinny person. The designers would debate if I was too big to fit in their clothes and once they liked me in certain clothes, they accepted it as well. I have learnt to be comfortable in my body.” Watch the gorgeous Katrina Kaif on March 3 at 9 pm on ‘India’s Glam Diva’ on Big CBS Love.  Saving the big cat  John Abraham joins Animal Planet to raise awareness about tiger conservation in India. 

For the entire month of March, John Abraham will share his personal message with the viewers in Animal Planet’s special programming line-up ‘Where Tigers Rule’ to protect the magnificent animal.  

‘Where Tigers Rule’, the month-long celebration of tigers premiered on March 1 and airs every night at 9 pm. The show enlightens viewers about tigers’ behaviour, predatory skills, family life and issues related to illegal poaching.

 It features man-eating tigers from Sunderbans, the motherly love of a tigress in Bandhavgarh, a family of tigers in Ranthambore forest, amongst others.  

Supporting the conservation of tigers, John Abraham said, “The tiger is the most magnificent animal and its protection and preservation is of national importance. Each of us should contribute in our own way and help increase awareness 
levels to secure the future of wild tigers. It is a great initiative to dedicate one full month to tigers, where viewers can enjoy superb programmes and get to know more about the big cat’s behaviour, hunting habits and habitat.”    Pack your bags!
