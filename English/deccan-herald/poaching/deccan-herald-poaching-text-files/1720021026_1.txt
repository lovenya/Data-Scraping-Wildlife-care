The skin and skulls of endangered animals, a carcass and weapons were recovered from the residence of a national-level shooter in Meerut town.

In a raid that lasted over 17 hours, around 117 kg meat of nilgai (blue bull), thousands of live cartridges and Rs 1 crore in cash were recovered by a joint team of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and forest department from the residence of Prashant Bishnoi.  

According to forest officials, Bishnoi’s father Devindra Kumar is a retired colonel.

Sources said the raid started at dawn on Saturday and continued till the early hours on Sunday. 
The horns of black bucks and sambar, stuffed deer, knives made of ivory, and pelts of leopards and other wild animals were found inside a godown in Bishnoi’s house, official sources said.
 
Besides, nearly 40 guns, including rifles and pistols, were also seized.

Smuggling racket?

Forest officials suspect that Bishnoi ran an international poaching and arms smuggling racket. 
“It seems to be a huge racket... it might have international connections,” an official said.

Bishnoi is absconding and efforts are on to trace him, the official said. Locals said the house, situated in the Civil Lines area, was mostly used by Bishnoi. Kumar seldom visited him.

Bishnoi had finished 65th in last year’s national shooting championship.
