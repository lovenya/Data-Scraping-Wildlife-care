Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday accused the Modi government of coercing Congress MLAs in Karnataka into joining the BJP but asserted that such efforts would not succeed.ADVERTISEMENT“The Modi government is threatening MLAs in Karnataka by instilling fear of investigating agencies such as ED, Income Tax, CBI and CVC. But their actions are doomed to fail,” Kharge told reporters here as BJP mounted efforts to poach Congress MLAs to topple the H D Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka.Dismissing doubts on the stability of the state government, Kharge wondered why BJP MLAs were holed up in a five-star hotel in Gurugram if the saffron party was confident about its strength. “Sankranti is a big festival in Karnataka, but BJP has kept its MLAs in a five-star hotel in Gurugram,” the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha said.Kharge accused the BJP of misleading the people through the media by saying their leaders were in touch with Congress MLAs. He said that all the party legislators would stand by the principles on which they were elected.“This is a ploy of the BJP – first mislead the people through media and put pressure on the government,” he said adding that the BJP's efforts will not succeed.“This is not the first time the BJP has done this. They have always tried to poach MLAs as they did in Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand. They wish to form the government by hook or by crook,” he said.Kharge said he had spoken with Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal and senior leader D K Shivakumar about the situation in the state. “All of them have told me that there was nothing to worry about,” he said adding that the BJP will never be successful in Karnataka.Kharge appealed to the people to see for themselves how the BJP was trying to unseat a stable government in the state.ALSO READ: LIVE: Operation Kamala 2.0Karnataka: 10 things to know about Operation Kamala 2.0Operation Kamala 2.0: 'Missing' MLAs start showing up
