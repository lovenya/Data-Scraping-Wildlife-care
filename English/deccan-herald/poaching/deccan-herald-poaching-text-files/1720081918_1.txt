In a setback to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in the BRS MLAs alleged poaching case, the division bench of the Telangana High Court had on February 6 upheld the earlier order of a single judge on December 26, 2022 transferring the case to CBI.The state government alleged the involvement of some top BJP leaders to poach its four MLAs, in order “to topple his government.”According to the FIR by the state police, MLA Rohith Reddy alleged that the accused had on October 26, 2022 offered him Rs 100 crore and in return the legislator had to leave the BRS.The state government had on November 9, 2022 formed an SIT, comprising state police officers to investigate the matter. The High Court has "unnecessarily" concluded that release of the CD by the Chief Minister on November 3, 2022 amounted to interference with the investigation, the state government claimed.
