Mystery shrouding the tiger poaching in the State was resolved by the Nagarahole forest department staff, comprising Chief Conservator of Forests, Hosamath, Deputy Conservator of Forests D Yatish Kumar, RFOs A V Satish, Vasudevmurthy and S S Hiremath and others. 
The team nabbed Paapu at his residence at Haggadahalla. Paapu was absconding since May 9, 2009 after the forest department officials seized a tiger pelt from his associates, Suresha of Hangala village, Kumaraswamy of Bheemanabeedu village of Gundlupet taluk and Umesha of Devarahosahalli village of Nanjungud taluk. The pelt was seized at Dhamanakatte on Mysore-Mananthavadi road by the officials, when the culprits were trying to transport it. A native of Hagadahalla village in Gundlupet taluk, Paapu was involved in several poaching cases including few tigers in the Stateâ€™s national parks. He was also involved in poaching several Sambars and Chitals.

Intitally, he would set a trap and strangulate the animals. However in the later days, he used a gun for poaching. Gopalaswamy and its adjoining hills were his hunting points. The team is yet to trace the weapon. 

He has also confessed that he shot the tiger using a gun. He was produced before the JMFC magistrate and has been sent to judicial custody until October, 28.
