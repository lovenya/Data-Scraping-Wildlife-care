 The region is expecting a competitive auctioning process as farmers from various parts of the State are expected to participate in the auction.

This time, 62 calves and four cattle will be out for auction. Last year, pairs were auctioned from Rs 45,000 to Rs 1.37 lakh. Farmers from Arasikere have bagged the attention of the auctioning process by bidding the highest for the cattle. Last year the total collection from the auction was Rs 25.42 lakh and the Department of Animal Husbandry is hoping to either earn the same amount this year or higher.

Last year farmers from Davangere, Chithradurga, Hasan, Tumkur districts took part. The participation is usually high because the Amruth Mahal varieties have proved out to be perfect not just for farming activities but also for various other activities like cart race, exhibitions etc.

Venkappa Malakappa Dudihalli had bought pair of cattle from last yearâ€™s auction paying Rs 70,000. He says that the cattle are healthy and are growing well. 

According to records there are 72 Amruth mahal pastures but unfortunately most of these pastures have been lost with the time due to encroachment and various other reasons. In the remaining bit of the kaval there are about 1,362 cattle. In Tarikere taluk and at Arasikere two calves each were eaten by Leopards. Apart from this many have died due to disease and aging too. 

Unfortunately most of the kavals have reached the situation of drought. 
The cattle do not have adequate fodder and drinking water, which is taking toll on the health of the cattle. Even some Black Bucks in the kaval too are suffering due to lack of food and water. 

On the other hand poaching of animals at Yeradugudda Kaval, Ballarayadurga and Thangavallithore kaval in Chithradurga district is threatening the animals in the Kaval limits.
