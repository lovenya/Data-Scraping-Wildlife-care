Poachers from Tamil Nadu have continued to enter forests illegally for poaching at Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary limits in Chamarajanagar district's Hanur.

A gang of poachers who had killed a deer abandoned the meat and fled after spotting the patrolling team of the Forest department on Saturday.

The poachers, who were said to have entered the Bheemanakallu forest area which comes under the Gopinatham wildlife range on Friday, are said to have stayed in the forest for two days and hunted the deer with a country rifle. They were drying the meat on a rock and escaped from the spot after spotting the patrolling team.

Several such incidents have been reported from Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary limits. It may be mentioned that poachers were caught carrying deer meat on a coracle in the Gopinatham range around six months ago. There was also a case of poachers using dogs to hunt a monitor lizard entering the forest after crossing the lake.ADVERTISEMENT
