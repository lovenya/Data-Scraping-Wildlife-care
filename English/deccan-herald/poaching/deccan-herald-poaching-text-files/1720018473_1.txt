The recently launched Indian Boxing Council (IBC) has been offered a membership from World Boxing Association (WBA). 

ADVERTISEMENTThe membership is a significant boost to the body which has initiated its drive across the nation offering boxers, trainers and coaches a chance to make a career in professional boxing.

"The World Boxing Association family wishes you and your team every success on this great initiative. WBA Directors and members will be glad to support and cooperate with the IBC to harvest great achievements working together for the progress of boxing," WBA vice President Gilberto Jesus Mendoza wrote in a letter to IBC chairman (Retd). Brigadier PKM Raja.

Raja said they were excited by WBA’s membership offer. “Obviously it is an affirmation to the professional boxing that we have launched and want to make this work,” Raja told Deccan Herald.

“IBC has just conducted its first workshop for trainers and coaches in Bhiwani and it went well and it will be conducting a similar exercise in Patiala on Tuesday. From there on we will travel eastwards.

“The response has been good and there is a sense of excitement among boxers who want to learn about pro-boxing,” he added.

The IBC will hold bouts for the national title and the pugilists within their fold will be guaranteed a minimum of four fights and Rs 6 lakh as basic winner’s purse prize.

Emphasising that they were out to provide options to the boxers and not poach the potential medallists at the amateur level, Raja believed there was tremendous scope for the two to co-exist. 

He also made clear they would not induct boxers who are below 23 years of age.
“We want the young boxers to represent India at various games, Olympics and win medals for the country. Once they are done with their amateur career, they can join us,” Raja said.
