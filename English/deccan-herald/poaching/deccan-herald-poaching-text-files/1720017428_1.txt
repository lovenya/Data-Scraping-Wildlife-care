Prashant Clayton Mascrenhas and Raksha Ram have come a long way together. Fellow travellers since their schooldays, they always dreamt of starting their own venture.

ADVERTISEMENT Given that both were die-hard foodies, they knew what the venture would be. ‘Rasta Cafe S02 E01’ in Kalyan Nagar, that was started by them a while ago, is not only a food and beverage place but a one-stop spot for entertainment as well. The duo wanted their restaurant to be a spot where people could come eat, drink and have a good time. “We wanted to go beyond food. We noticed that a lot of our clients are from the software industry. Most of them come out here to hang out for long hours and prefer a place where they can sit and talk at leisure. We offer just this,” adds Prashant. 

Some of the choicest dishes at ‘Rasta’ is the special breakfast with a choice of eggs, baked beans, hash browns, chicken sausages, chicken ham, orange juice and coffee and tea. Another dish ‘Eggs al mode’ come with a choice of two eggs which one could choose from spanish omelette, poached eggs, sausage omelette, scrambled eggs, cheese omelette. This is served with toast and hash browns. 

Some of the other must-try dishes are ‘stuffed chicken breast’ which is a lightly browned chicken breast marinated in herbs with rich spinach stuffing and served with mashed potatoes and pepper sauce. The ‘grilled fish steak’ has savory pink basa fillets marinated in olive oil and lemon juice, basil, garlic and then grilled to perfection. This is later served with steamed vegetables. The eating joint  also has an array of health drinks such as beetroot booster, tropical cucumber, celery diet and fresh carrot juice. 

“We believe in serving food that is not only delicious but healthy as well. Every dish has a healthy twist to it,” says Prashant. It is located at 402, 7th Main Road, 1st Block, HRBR Layout, Kalyan Nagar.
