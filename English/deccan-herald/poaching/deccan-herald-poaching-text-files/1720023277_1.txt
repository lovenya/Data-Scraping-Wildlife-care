Hundreds of  wildlife experts carrying sophisticated cameras began combing the  forests in Nepal's southern plains on Tuesday in the Himalayan nation's  biggest campaign yet to count the number of endangered tigers roaming in  its national parks.ADVERTISEMENTThe survey is crucial for  planning strategy to double the number of Royal Bengal tigers in Nepal  by 2022, as pledged by the Nepali government. Nepal is currently home to  176 of the animals, which are threatened by poaching and habitat loss.The  census will take place in several national parks in southern Nepal -  reserves that spread across into neighbouring India, which will be  conducting a similar survey on its part of the border."Simultaneous  counting will help avoid the same tiger which crosses over from one  side to the other from being counted twice as its motion will be  captured by another camera on the other side," said Maheshwar Dhakal, an  ecologist with Nepal's National Parks and Wildlife Conservation  Department."This way the findings can be very close to accuracy."Dhakal said technicians would place camera traps along the tigers' paths through the area to capture their images as they move.Thousands  of tigers once roamed the forests in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. But  their numbers have plummeted to just about 3,000 now, wildlife experts  say.One big challenge to their  survival is illegal trade in tiger parts, which are in high demand for  use in traditional Chinese medicine.In  2010 Nepal committed to double the number of tigers by 2022 by stepping  up conservation efforts part of a pledge to international community.  The census will become a crucial part of strategic planning towards this  goal."As part of that commitment  we have to increase the number of tigers to 250 in eight years," Dhakal,  also the technical coordinator of the tiger count project, said."Achieving it looks possible if we can control poaching, protect habitats and involve the local community in conservation."
