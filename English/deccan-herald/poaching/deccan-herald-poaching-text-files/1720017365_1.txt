Ahead of Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi’s swearing-in ceremony, Sri Lanka and Pakistan ordered the release of Indian fishermen in their custody.

ADVERTISEMENTWelcoming the goodwill gesture, Modi posted on micro-blogging site Twitter: “I welcome the step by Sri Lanka & Pakistan to release our fishermen. I welcome our fishermen brothers back home!”

The decision to release the fishermen followed invitation to both Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the swearing-in ceremony.

Pakistan released 152 Indian fisherman while Sri Lanka released all the Indian fishermen arrested by the Lankan Navy for poaching.

Last year, in August, Pakistan had released around 337 Indian prisoners from jails. Later on, 15 Indian fishermen were released as a goodwill gesture ahead of Deepavali festival.

Earlier this year, Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had ordered the release of arrested fishermen after India abstained from voting on an anti-Sri Lanka motion at the UN Human Rights Council.

Rajapaksa tweeted: “As a goodwill measure on the occasion of Narendra Modi’s swearing-in, the President instructs officials to release Indian fishermen in custody.”

The Sri Lankan government did not give the number of fishermen, mostly from Tamil Nadu, who would be released.

The 152 Indian fishermen, who will be released from Pakistan, are from various parts of Gujarat, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.  They will arrive on the Wagha border in Punjab.
