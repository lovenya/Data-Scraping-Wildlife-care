A diet high in fibre, low in fat, particularly animal fat, and the one that includes generous portions of fruits and vegetables is key to preventing cancer. It also minimises or excludes alcohol consumption and nicotine intake.ADVERTISEMENTDietary recommendationsEmphasise on plant-based sources. Eat five or more servings of vegetables and fruits. This food group is not only low in fat and high in fibre, it also contains many cancer-fighting substances.Carotenoid, the pigment that gives dark colour to fruits and vegetables, has been proven to prevent cancer. Cabbage, broccoli, sprouts, carrots, yellow-coloured fruits and vegetables and turnip contain flavones and indoles, which have anti-cancer properties.Food high in phytoestrogens, particularly soy, or high in precursor compounds, such as grains and vegetables with woody stem that contain lignans, can lower the risk of cancer.Vitamin C found in citrus fruits and several vegetables may lower the risk for cancer of oesophagus and stomach. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant neutralising cancer-causing chemicals that form in the body.Food preparationStudies have shown increased cancer risk posed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and heterocyclic amines, which are formed when cooking methods like grilling, boiling, barbecuing and smoking are used. These toxic substances are formed during combustion of carbon fuel and hydrolysis of proteins. Research has found mutagenic activity in foods after frying and charcoal broiling. Healthier cooking alternatives for meats include boiling, poaching, steaming, stewing, bracing, baking, microwaving and roasting.(The author is HOD - Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital)
