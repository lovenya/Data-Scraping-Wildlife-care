Former deputy chief minister K S Eshwarappa said on Friday that the BJP will not lure any MLAs of either the Congress or the JD(S). The coalition government is counting its days and will fall on its own, he said.ADVERTISEMENTEshwarappa was in the city to tour three districts ahead of the elections to the urban local bodies.Responding to Water Resources Minister D K Shivakumar’s allegation that five BJP leaders have been trying to lure Congress MLAs, he said, the Congress leaders have no faith in their own MLAs. "The Congress leaders themselves are admitting that their MLAs are weak. The coalition government is counting its last days and BJP will form the government shortly," he said.Eshwarappa said that with only 78 MLAs, the Congress has extended its support to the JD(S) to form the government. “We (BJP) will never try to purchase MLAs from another party. BJP’s 104 MLAs are like ‘Lions’ and thus we need no MLAs from other parties,” he said.He accused the ministers of H D Kumaraswamy’s Cabinet of involvement in illegal transfers of the officials. “Ministers are the agents in the transfer of the government officials,” Eshwarappa commented.While JD(S) leaders are accusing the Congress leaders of indulging in corruption, Congress leaders point out the corruption of the JD(S) and the government has failed to take off in the state.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced several schemes for the development of farmers and backward classes. “We are touring the state to popularise the development activities of the Union government. Modi has announced a support price for 12 crops and hence he should be the PM for another term,” Eshwarappa said.
