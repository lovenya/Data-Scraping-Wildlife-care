Ahead of the June 10 Rajya Sabha polls, the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has decided to shift its MLAs from a resort in suburban Malad to a five-star hotel in south Mumbai as part of a strategy to ward off poaching, a senior party leader said on Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTAll legislators of the Sena have been summoned to Mumbai and they will stay together till the polls on June 10, he said."We were in 'The Retreat' (at Madh island in northwest Mumbai) and all our ministers too were present there. That was part of our strategy. We will be moving to hotel 'The Trident' (in south Mumbai) today," Sena MLA and party spokesperson Sunil Prabhu said.The Trident is at a stone's throw from the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly where voting will take place for the six Rajya Sabha seats.The Sena has 55 MLAs (one MLA had died due to a heart attack last month) in the 288-member House.Chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Monday met the MLAs of his party as well as others supporting it.After more than two decades, the state will witness a contest in the Rajya Sabha polls as there are seven candidates in the fray for six seats.Also Read: Maharashtra Rajya Sabha polls: Battle of nerves between MVA, BJPThe Sena has fielded two candidates -- Sanjay Raut and Sanjay Pawar -- while the BJP has nominated Union minister Piyush Goyal, Anil Bonde and Dhananjay Mahadik.
