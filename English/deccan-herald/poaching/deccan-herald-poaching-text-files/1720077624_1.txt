Without paying heed to what country was facing, you make such statements," the bench further told Sisodia.Sisodia had alleged that the Assam Chief Minister had awarded a contract for Covid-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits during the peak of pandemic in 2021, to a company linked to his wife.Singhvi contended Sisodia was being browbeaten and that he had never really alleged that Sarma's wife, Riniki Bhuyan Sarma received any money. The bench declined to grant any relief to the AAP leader, stating that Sisodia should have given an unconditional apology. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appeared for Assam CM while Nalin Kohli Additional Advocate General represented the state government. Sisodia's counsel finally preferred to withdraw his plea.On November 4, the Gauhati High Court had dismissed his plea for quashing of the proceedings at the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup at Guwahati on the complaint filed on June 4.
