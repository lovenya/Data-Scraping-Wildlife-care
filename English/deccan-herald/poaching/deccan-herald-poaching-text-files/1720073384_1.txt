A court in Mansa on Sunday sent Mundi, Pandit and Joker to police custody for six days."The Punjab Police made three arrests on Saturday in connection with the Shubhdeep Singh murder case in a joint operation with central agencies and the Delhi Police," the director general of police told reporters here.Twenty-three arrests have so far been made in the case.

There is information that another accused is being pursued, the Punjab Police chief said.A preliminary interrogation of the three accused arrested on Saturday revealed that Joker was stationed in Nepal earlier and was in touch with Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind in the case. Brar was also the mastermind of their escape plan and had promised to help them settle in Dubai, Yadav said.Sharing the details of their escape plan, the DGP said, "Mundi and Pandit had gone to West Bengal after shifting their base from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. They had a plan to go to Dubai through Nepal, using fake passports."He said there was an alternative plan to go to Thailand through the land route via Nepal and Bhutan or, if fake passports were delivered to them in Nepal, they would have taken a flight to Bangkok and later, go to Dubai.The DGP said during Pandit's interrogation, it came to the fore that he was asked by Lawrence Bishnoi to conduct reconnaissance in Mumbai to chalk out a strategy to kill Salman Khan."Pandit's interrogation revealed that he was approached by Lawrence Bishnoi through Sampat Nehra and Goldy Brar to target Bollywood actor Salman Khan. Along with Sachin Bishnoi and Santosh Yadav, he had carried out reconnaissance in Mumbai. They spent a lot of time in Mumbai. During the investigation, we will verify this angle too," the officer said."Whatever disclosures they made are yet to be corroborated. if the need arises, we will send our team to Mumbai. It is a preliminary disclosure," Yadav said.The police said in 2021, Pandit had jumped parole that he had got to attend the last rites of his mother and was absconding since then.Pandit revealed that earlier also, he had carried reconnaissance on multiple occasions with an intention to kill Moosewala to avenge the killing of Vicky Middukhera, the police said.To another question, Yadav said the police had named those people in the FIR on whom Moosewala's father had a suspicion."We stand with him (Moosewala's father) fully. We are committed to ensuring justice in this case," the DGP said.He said a red-corner notice has been issued against Brar.The DGP also said Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann is taking feedback on the case every two weeks. "There is a strong political will to solve the case," Yadav added.Moosewala was killed when he, along with his friend and a cousin, was travelling in a jeep to Jawahar Ke village. A day earlier, the Punjab Police had pruned his security cover on a temporary basis.His vehicle was waylaid and bullets were sprayed on him by six shooters. Brar, a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, had claimed responsibility for the killing.Brar had executed the plan to kill Moosewala to avenge the killing of Middukhera.Youth Akali leader Middukhera was killed last year.
