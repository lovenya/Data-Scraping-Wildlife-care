JD(S) MLA K M Shivalinge Gowda (Arsikere) on Tuesday told the Assembly that the ‘MLA shopping’ trend set by the BJP in Karnataka had tarnished the reputation of the state's lawmakers, including himself, so much so that his integrity had been questioned by his own wife and children.ADVERTISEMENTParticipating in the audiogate debate, Gowda cursed the BJP for “torturing” Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy through its attempts to topple the government.“If I leave for Bengaluru, my wife and children ask if I have struck a deal with somebody. They are suspicious because people are heard saying that I have been booked. Thanks to such rumours, the reputation of all MLAs has been tarnished,” he said. He also demanded that the BJP put an end to its MLA poaching activities.“We have no credibility left as so many deals are being struck. There have been so many conspiracies to topple the coalition government in the last eight months. Is there no limit to this? Stop this soap opera. Do you (BJP) have no self respect? You are killing democracy. I am deeply hurt. There have been repeated attempts to induce the MLAs. You will be cursed if you continue with this. The people will not forgive you for continuously torturing the chief minister,” he added.Gowda charged that his party MLA Narayan Gowda (KR Pet) had been held captive by the BJP in Mumbai. “Narayan Gowda has been hospitalised in Mumbai. His relatives met me and told me that he has been held captive,” he said.Earlier, Kumaraswamy too had made a mention of the KR Pet MLA being in Mumbai. “The BJP members are openly alleging that I am indulging in vengeance politics. One of my MLAs is in Mumbai. But I haven’t spoken about his plight so far,” he said.
