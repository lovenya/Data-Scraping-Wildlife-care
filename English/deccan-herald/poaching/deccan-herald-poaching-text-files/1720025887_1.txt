BJP leader Shobha Karandlaje on Tuesday accused the Siddaramaiah-led government of misusing the administrative machinery to poach leaders from other parties.ADVERTISEMENTAddressing the media in Bengaluru, Karandlaje said the Congress regime had started blackmailing former BJP leader Anand Singh and his associate B Nagendra by constituting a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the illegal mining case, despite the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) absolving them of all charges."The leaders were harassed and forced to join the Congress. Unable to face the SIT, they joined the Congress. The Congress, which is known for its bogus Bhagyas (schemes), gave them a clean chit by withdrawing the SIT inquiry against them on March 12. The cases involving their companies were delisted from hearing," Shobha added.Accusing the Congress of having 'double standards', she said the duo was earlier branded as tainted by the party. "The Congress should explain the reasons for its duplicity."On the BJP's last-minute decision to withdraw B Y Vijayendra's candidature, Karandlaje said that the decision was taken as part of the party's election strategy.
