K T Veeresh (28) and Aanji (23), residents of Sonnappanahalli, Mukundappa (55) and S Eeresh (32), residents of Byatrayanapura, Yelahanka and Ravi (22) of Amruthahalli are the five arrested. They were nabbed by the Chikkajala traffic police on Saturday morning when they were transporting the stolen sign boards. A goods auto rickshaw used for transportation has been recovered.

The accused had stolen these sign boards put up at different stretches on Bangalore-Bellary Road during the last two and half months. According to police, they would sell the booty at Rs 60 per kg. They never poached any commercial sign board or hoarding. This was to play it safe as they were working for BBMP contractor Anand Reddy and would carry out their operation while on duty itself.ADVERTISEMENT
