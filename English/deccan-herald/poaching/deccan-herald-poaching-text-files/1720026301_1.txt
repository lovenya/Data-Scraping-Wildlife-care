Disgruntled legislator B C Patil, who was believed to have been swaying toward the BJP, appeared before Congress leader Siddaramaiah early Saturday morning and claimed allegiance to the party.ADVERTISEMENTPatil skipped the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting on Friday and has not attended the budget session of the legislature since it began on February 6. The Hirekerur MLA has been miffed for some time now, especially over not being made a minister and that his taluk and district had not received much attention under the Congress-JD(S) regime.Early in the day, Patil visited Siddaramaiah’s official residence Cauvery. Patil expressed his displeasure with Siddaramaiah, while also assuring him of not deserting the party.Patil also denied speculation about him having joined other disgruntled MLAs in Mumbai. About half-a-dozen disgruntled legislators, including former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, are said to be holed up in Mumbai. The BJP is hoping they will resign in the coming days.Siddaramaiah is learnt to have advised Patil not to fall prey to any poaching attempt by the BJP.“Don’t end up spoiling your political future,” a source quoted Siddaramaiah as having told Patil. The cop-turned-actor-turned-politician told reporters that he was unhappy with Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy’s 2019-20 budget.“Kumaraswamy has neglected my district. I’m not happy with the budget,” he said.“I didn’t go to Mumbai to meet disgruntled MLAs. But I did meet Siddaramaiah to express my disappointment. It is because I’m disappointed that I’ve not attended the budget session,” he said.
