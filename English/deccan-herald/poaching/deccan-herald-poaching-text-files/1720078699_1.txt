Congress government in Puducherry fell into minority after several MLAs resigned. “BJP at the centre have done it now despite pleading so many times. It is a clear indication of BJP’s ploy, the BJP has been poaching the MLAs, luring them. It happened in three cases,” said V Narayanasamy. He added, “People of Puducherry will give fitting reply to their grand sena to topple our government. We will prove our majority and do it according to the constitution.”
