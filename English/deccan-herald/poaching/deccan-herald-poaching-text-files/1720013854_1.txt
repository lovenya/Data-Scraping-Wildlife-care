The doctor will observe the jumbo for the next one week before taking any further course of action.

As per the rules, darting the wild jumbo needs the permission of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests. Without darting it, it will be difficult for the doctor to prescribe any medicine. 
Besides, it was very difficult to treat the wild tusker as it would charge anybody who goes near the animal. In this peculiar situation, Dr Nagaraj who is an expert in treating elephants, said he has no other go except orally treating the pachyderm.

This morning, PCCF B K Singh, chief conservator of forests, project elephant, Ajai Mishra, Forest Cell DIG Chikkerur and others visited the spot to see the condition of the injured elephant. 

The doctor who saw the elephant from a binocular opined that through there was no external injuries, an abscess was found just below the elbow joint. Probably, according to him, this may be hindering the movement of the tusker. 

"We saw swelling in the jumbo's elbow joint and that may be giving problems for it. Without taking x-ray of the swollen area it was very difficult to tell the nature of the disease", he told Deccan Herald.

However, he handed over antibiotics and other tablets to the staff members of Anti-Poaching Camp to mix it with jaggery and place it near the water so that it consume. This is the one and only method to treat the injured pachyderm. Giving a dose of antibiotics and other tablets may reduce pain as well as cure the abscess.

Dr Nagaraj said several procedures have to be followed before darting the wild jumbo. The vital details like weight and height are to be taken to fix the dosage. 

Any miscalculation in the dosage may result in the death of jumbo. So, the permission of PCCF is required before tranquilising the elephant.ADVERTISEMENT
