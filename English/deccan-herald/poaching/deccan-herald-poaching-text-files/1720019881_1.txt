It's unfortunate that BJP didn't follow discipline in the Assembly: Shiv Sena's Priyanka ChaturvediIndia\u2019s PM Narendra Modiji himself had spoken about discipline while in assembly or parliament, advised against the urge of running into the floor of the house. Today his own party MLAs didn\u2019t follow that today in the #MahaFloorTest .
