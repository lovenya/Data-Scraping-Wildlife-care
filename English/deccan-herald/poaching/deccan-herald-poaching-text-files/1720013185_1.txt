Polar bears hunt for seals from a layer of ice. Because of the rise in temperatures due to global warming, the ice melts earlier in the year, driving them to the shores before they have built sufficient fat reserves, leading to deaths. 

Another reason a species has very few numbers is mostly because of us humans. Woman sport fancy handbags made of snake skins, also called leather. Elephants are killed for their tusks used to make small ivory statues sold at crazy prices. 

Apart from this, only a few endangered species make it to the lists and receive legal protection. Many species become extinct or majorly endangered without gaining public notice. Is it worth it? And, why should we care? Imagine you are a mother or grandmother, and you show your children or grandchildren a picture of our majestic, beautiful national animal, the tiger, but tell them they will never, ever be able to see one. 
Or think about the ruthless killing of these innocent creatures for our own pleasures. A few endangered species are Blue whales, Tigers and Giant pandas.

 The tiger is India’s national animal. It is greatly endangered and is the largest cat species in the world. They have few enemies apart from humans, such as bears, large buffalo and elephants. Humans not only kill tigers to eliminate themselves from danger but also for skin, trophies and sport. Lots of superstitions also surround tigers. Necklaces of tiger claws are supposed to keep the evil eye away from a child. Tiger’s body parts are prized as medicine. There are only 5000 to 7000 tigers left in the entire world. Giant Pandas diet mainly comprises of bamboo and sometimes small rodents. 

Wild pandas only live in remote, central regions of China. Pandas are mainly endangered because of habitat loss. Bamboo takes a long time to grow. Earlier when the bamboo in a forest was consumed, they would move on to the next forest. These days, since forests are being cut down, they die due to shortage of food. 

There are only about 1000 giant pandas left in the wild and only about 100 more in captivity. Blue whales are the largest animals known to have existed. They are long and slender, and are various shades of bluish gray and lighter underneath. 

Blue whales were available in abundance at the beginning of the 20th century in almost all the oceans. For 40 years, whale hunters were on a rampage and hunted whales almost to extinction until protected by the international community in1966.

 There are said to be only around 5000 to 12000 blue whales alive today. What can we do to protect these dying species? 

We should not buy articles made from animals body parts. We should increase awareness in our community so we can all work towards this. We should make an appeal to the government to ban poaching and to protect all endangered species. We can donate money to organizations such as World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, etc. We can also join these organizations. We can plant trees and contribute towards saving our forests and animal habitats. Our animal friends are calling out to us for help and it is our responsibility to do so before it is too late.ADVERTISEMENT
