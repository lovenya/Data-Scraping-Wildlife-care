The famed Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens that displays a wide diversity of fauna, added one more species to its collection, great Indian one-horned rhinoceros. Two of them have arrived from Patna Zoo.

ADVERTISEMENTThe rhinos Virat and Bobbli will be put on display as soon as the animals acclimatise to their new environment. 

While Virat, the three-year-old male rhino weighs 1,360 kg, Bobbli, a female, is a year old and weighs 725 kg.

B P Ravi, Executive Director of the Zoo, said rhinos were among the highly endangered species, due to the extensive poaching of the animals in grasslands of Northern and North-Eastern India. 

“However, their numbers are showing some signs of improvement due to conservation efforts,” he said. 

He said the zoo had been trying to acquire the rhinos for the past five years, after the last one-horned rhino of the zoo died due to age-related illness. Mysore zoo has exchanged 13 animals including a giraffe, Indian gaurs, hyenas and wolves. 

According to C Suresh Kumar, Assistant Director and head of Veterinary section of the Zoo, it took four days of travel on road to shift the animals.

“The animals are healthy and are doing fine.” he said.
