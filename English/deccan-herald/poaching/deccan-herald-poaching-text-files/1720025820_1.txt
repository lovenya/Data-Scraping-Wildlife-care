And we hope that in future they will survive and thrive in Bangladesh."Across the region, the population of Asian Forest Tortoises has plummeted by at least 80 percent in the past 135 years and the species is critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Environmentalists say the success of the breeding programme is no guarantee the species will survive once the newborns are released back into the wild.Logging and slash-and-burn agriculture are eating into their natural habitat, Rahman says.The human population in the lush Chittagong hills has soared, with the area's tribal minority groups pushed further into the jungle by the encroachment of settlers from elsewhere in Bangladesh.Hills have been stripped bare of vegetation for new roads and development, and the tortoises are also popular in tribal cuisine.World Bank conservationist Ishtiak Sobhan said environmental activists are working to encourage the indigenous population to cut tortoise meat from their diets.Some tribespeople are also being trained to rescue the animals from poachers, with around two to three saved each year.Meanwhile, a decades-long local insurgency has hampered efforts by authorities to protect the wild creatures and other endangered animals in the forest.Senior forest department official Imran Ahmed told AFP the government will roll out new projects to conserve the fauna in the hilly area."Our plan is now to involve the local tribal people to conserve these rare animals. We want to co-manage the project with them. I think that'll bring sustainable success," Ahmed told AFP.
