The hike means that students of the 2010-2012 batch will now have to pay Rs 13 lakh for the course.

Briefing reporters ahead of the annual convocation on Monday, the Director of IIMB Pankaj Chandra said the fee had been hiked by Rs 2 lakh from Rs 11 lakh to Rs 13 lakh for the two year PGPM course. It may be recalled that the iconic institution had raised the fee by Rs 1.5 lakh for the 2009 batch as well. 
This hike in fees follows closely on the heels of a similar hike of Rs 1 lakh for the programme announced by the IIMA. The new fee structure will mean an additional burden of Rs 1 lakh for each year on the students. 

Chandra also said that the total intake for the programme for the 2010-2012 batch will be 375 students. He added that intake will be increased to 420 students for next year’s batch with the addition of a new section from 2011.

Chandra also played down the impact of foreign universities entering the country. 
Responding to suggestions from the media about the foreign varsities poaching top faculty from top institutions like the IIMB, Chandra said, “We will seek to retain our faculty by providing greater compensation for them and also the necessary infrastructure.”ADVERTISEMENT
