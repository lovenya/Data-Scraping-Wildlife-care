Murshidabad: Senior TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee on Wednesday asserted ten top BJP leaders are keen on switching over to the TMC, a claim dubbed baseless by the saffron party.ADVERTISEMENTWhile conducting a road show in a Murshidabad Lok Sabha constituency, Banerjee said the party will open its doors at the right moment and the "BJP will be wiped out of the state"."The BJP is trying to get into the game of breaking parties, but they can't win in it. They poached two of our MPs, and we replied by taking two of their MPs, Arjun Singh and Babul Supriyo. Recently, by using ED raids, they inducted Tapas Ray. At least 10 top leaders of the BJP are in the queue to join the TMC", he said.Also Read:TMC alleges BJP link after Kolkata cops arrest Headley's contact for recceing Abhishek Banerjee's house, officeAlso Read:TMC alleges BJP link after Kolkata cops arrest Headley's contact for recceing Abhishek Banerjee's house, officeReacting to Banerjee's claim, BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said after the elections are over, the "TMC will disintegrate like a pack of cards"."These are nothing but political rhetoric out of frustration of losing in West Bengal.
