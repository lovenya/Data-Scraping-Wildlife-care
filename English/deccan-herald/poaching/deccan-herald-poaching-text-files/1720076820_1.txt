Shivakumar became notable as the Congress’ go-to man in 2002. The then Maharashtra CM Vilasrao Deshmukh sought the help of his Karnataka counterpart S M Krishna to safeguard the party’s MLAs. Krishna entrusted the job to Shivakumar, who kept the MLAs safe in a Bidadi resort. In 2017, Shivakumar safeguarded 44 Gujarat MLAs in the same resort, even as he faced I-T raids. He did the same for Congress-JD(S) after the 2018 Karnataka Assembly polls threw up a fractured mandate. When MLAs resigned in 2019, Shivakumar was the first responder, but he could do little.
