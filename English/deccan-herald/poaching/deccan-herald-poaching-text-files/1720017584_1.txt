The State government’s decision to give KIADB land on a 99-year-lease basis rather than sale is hostile to the interests of the small scale industry and will adversely affect the state’s MSME growth as the SSI sector contribution’s is next only to agriculture, said Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (Kassia) on Wednesday. 

ADVERTISEMENT“The allotment of KIADB land on a 99-year-lease is a retrograde measure and anti-small scale industry,” said Kassia President Chidananda M Rajamane. 

“Land allotment should continue to be on the basis of 10-year lease-cum-sale as earlier because land is the only asset that remains with the small entrepreneur and the only insurance against any adverse eventuality.”

While conceding that the decision was taken with good intentions to prevent poaching of industrial land by real estate sharks, Rajamane remarked that the remedy could turn out to be worse than the disease. 

“A majority of the available industrial land is given away to big industrial houses leaving only a very small percentage to the ordinary small entrepreneur whose requirement is invariably limited to a few acres of land. The big players often use the land allotted for speculative purposes, but in an effort to stop such gross misuse of land by large industries, the government cannot take away the last remaining semblance of succour — in the form of sale deed issued by the KIADB — available to the small entrepreneur.”
