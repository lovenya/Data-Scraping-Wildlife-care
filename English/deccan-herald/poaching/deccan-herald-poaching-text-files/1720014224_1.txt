Chairman D H Shankarmurthy allowed the submission with the condition that no comments are made on the top court’s ruling. 

With the Congress vociferously demanding the resignation of Yeddyurappa, the House witnessed allegations, counter-allegations and commotion between the Congress and the treasury benches.

Leader of the Opposition, Motamma, making the submission, alleged that the chief minister and the Speaker had ousted the 16 MLAs illegally without giving them time to defend themselves on the floor of the House. The constituencies represented by these MLAs were thus orphaned. The duo misused their power, she said.

The chief minister, in order to save his government, used the MLAs, and when the MLAs complained against him to the governor, they were disqualified. “The Speaker is an abettor to this. Six months you have run the government without majority. Is it legally correct? Isn’t it a murder of democracy,” Motamma questioned the ruling party.

Minister S A Ramdas, raising objections to Motamma’s remarks, said the discussion should not be allowed, as it was against the Speaker and the chief minister.

Joining the debate, some Congress members alleged that the chief minister poached MLAs from other parties through Operation Lotus. Minister Govind Karjol, citing the case of the Congress taking Siddaramaiah into its fold from the JD(S), said the trend was set by the Congress. Motamma argued that Siddaramaiah had joined the Congress on his own.

When Congress leader Veeranna Mathikatti said the BJP government was in power “at the mercy of the UPA government”, the BJP members strongly objected to it, saying the party enjoyed majority.

Leader of the House, V S Acharya, pointed out that the Supreme Court had criticised the inaction of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the 2G spectrum scam. 

There was no need for the chief minister to resign, he said. The Chairman disallowed the motion on technical grounds, following which the Congress members staged a walkout. The JD(S) members had boycotted the session.ADVERTISEMENT
