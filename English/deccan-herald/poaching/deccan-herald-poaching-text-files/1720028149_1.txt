Union Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation D V Sadananda Gowda, on Monday, termed Congress and JD(S) leaders as 'thieves' for allegedly trying to poach BJP MLAs in the state.ADVERTISEMENT“They (Congress & JD(S)) are thieves. Congress leaders have admitted that some BJP legislators are in touch. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has admitted he can poach BJP MLAs. Who then, is a thief?” Gowda retorted, when reporters sought to know his reaction to the Congress accusation that the saffron party was trying to poach Congress MLAs.Gowda stated that BJP had not made any effort to poach legislators as there was no need for it. But if a Congress or JD(S) MLA, wishes to join BJP, he/she is welcome."We believe in democracy. BJP will never try to destabilise the coalition government," the Union Minister reiterated.Gowda also said the BJP must not be held responsible if the coalition government falls on its own. "The Congress is facing rebellion from its own ministers and MLAs," Gowda added.Siddaramaiah holds parleysMeanwhile, Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah, began consulting disgruntled party MLAs, in an effort to iron out differences. He held a closed-door meeting with party MLAs Dr K Sudhakar and P T Parameshwar Naik.Siddaramaiah is likely to hold a separate meeting with Municipalities Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and his brother Satish, who have threatened to raise the banner of revolt against the party. The Congress high command has entrusted the responsibility of resolving all issues within the party, to Siddaramaiah.
