Ruckus began within ten minutes of the proceedings as the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) House convened a meeting on Monday. The BJP had alleged the AAP knows it is not in a position to get a majority in the MCD's Standing Committee poll as many of its own councillors will not vote for the party.
