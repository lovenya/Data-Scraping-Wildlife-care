The Jodhpur bench of Rajasthan High Court has issued notices to Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Sonali Bendre and Tabu on an appeal filed by the state government against their acquittal in connection with the hunting of two blackbucks in 1998.ADVERTISEMENTBollywood actor Salman Khan was convicted and sentenced to five-year imprisonment by the chief judicial magistrate court (Jodhpur district) on April 5 last year whereas the four film stars were acquitted by the trial court in the case pertaining to hunting of two blackbucks on October 1 and 2, 1998 at Kankani village near Jodhpur.The additional public prosecutor Mahipal Vishnoi said, "State government has filed leave-to-appeal against acquitting the five co-accused. But he told the court about the trial court's judgement last year which admitted that the five co-accused were with Salman, the main accused, during blackbucksâ€™ hunting, but they were acquitted by giving them benefit of doubt". Court has sought the reply from the cine stars in eight weeks.  Actor Salman Khan reached Jodhpur on Sunday along with his two sisters, Alvira and Arprita.
