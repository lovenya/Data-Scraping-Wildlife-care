To begin with, Chef Abhijit Saha demonstrated simple yet delightful recipes for the competition. Beer was used as a key ingredient for dishes like the mushroom salad and poached fish. The most interesting dish however was the dessert that was prepared using strawberries and beer. This was then followed by a “cook-off” between Raphael Parambi, a dentist and Harathi Reddy Rebello, who attempted to outdo each other in the preparation of the dishes where beer was the essential ingredient.

Using his wit and humour, Raphael combined his expertise in the kitchen to put together ‘beer prawns’ while Harathi churned out a ‘beer and cheese fondue’. As tough as it seemed, the contestants had to also impress the judges with their skill, presentation and of course the taste. “This was one adventure I will never forget. I did pick up many tips that I could use when I cook at home as well,” said one of the guests. The competition was judged by Anita Nair and Nisha Millet, who were mighty impressed making all the more difficult for them to choose a winner. 

“It was a tough choice but the categories on what we had to judge on, made it easy to pick one winner,” said Nisha. Finally, it was Raphael who came out as the winner. The afternoon then concluded with an elaborate feast.ADVERTISEMENT
