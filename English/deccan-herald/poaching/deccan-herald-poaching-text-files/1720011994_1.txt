Two volunteers and one forest official will work on each of the line transacts and collect data on tiger population.

The census will be conducted from 6.30 am to 1.30 pm and during the first three days the volunteers will look for signs of existence of tiger like Tiger feces, footprints and marks of nails on the tree barks.
