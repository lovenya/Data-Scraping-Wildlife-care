If he ever decides to do so, I am done!” Salman said, after Shera, unveiled the theatrical promo of his upcoming film ‘Bodyguard’.

Controversies have always dogged Salman with the actor being in news for wrong reasons – be it for roughing up media-persons, his alleged underworld links, his aggressive behaviour with his actress girlfriends from Somy Ali to Aishwarya Rai, involvement in a hit-and-run and the Chinkara poaching case. 

However, the 45-year-old actor says that he trusts his bodyguard, who has been with him for the past 15 years. 

“I can trust him completely. I can trust him with money matters, family, my life, before having alcohol and after having alcohol and all women in my life. He is trustworthy. He has been a bodyguard to all those women who were part of my life,” Salman said.

The Dabangg star’s relationship with actress Aishwarya was much in news as the former beauty queen had accused him of harassment. Aishwarya had claimed that after their break-up in 2002, Salman had not been able to come to terms with it and was hounding her. Her parents had also lodged a complaint against him. 

Later, Salman was arrested for rash and negligent driving as his car, which ran into a bakery in Mumbai killed one person sleeping on the pavement. Three others were injured in the mishap.

In 2006, Salman was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for killing a chinkara in Jodhpur, Rajasthan way back in 1998.ADVERTISEMENT
