Submitting a report on the progress of the development works in the district before the Lok Adalat here, the DC said the Government aimed to promote the district as a heritage and eco destination as there are world famous temples in Belur-Halebeed and regions like Sakleshpur are rich in bio diversity. 

The master plan will be ready in a month and would be submitted for approval to the State Government, the DC informed. 

The district administration has sent a proposal to provide UGD lines in all the town municipal council and grama panchayat limits. 

If the Government approves the project, the UGD lines will be provided in all the taluks and grama panchayat limits by December 2012, Jagadish said and added that the administration has acted against 82 illegal stone crushing units and closed them. 

The DC disclosed that the district has about 162 lakes. Encroachment on 176 hectares of land in the boundaries of 65 lakes was cleared. The District Pollution Control Board has initiated all measures to prevent pollutants entering Hemavathi and Yagachi rivers - the drinking water sources. 

Kokkare Bellur 

In his report, Deputy Commissioner of Mandya Dr P C Jaffer said the administration chalked out seven different projects to solve the drinking water crisis across the district. 
“If all the seven projects are implemented, the district can meet the potable water requirement. The ground water in district was tested for chemical content and has been found free from hazardous chemicals.” 

Jaffer said his office has proposed for the development of Kokkare Bellur bird habitat. The administration has chalked out a plan for desilting and planting saplings at a cost of Rs 1.67 crore. 

Also, the lakes near towns like Mandya, Malavalli, Pandavapura, Nagamangala and K R Pet will also be rejuvenated. The administration was clearing the encroachments on the lakes, he added. 

Drinking water 

All the Deputy Commissioners underlined the measures taken for preventing the man-animal conflict in the fringes of forest like setting up of anti-poaching camps, farmers’ committees and others. 

Amarnarayan, Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajnagar said the state government has approved a major drinking water project at a cost of Rs 260 crores. 

Water will be lifted from Kabini to meet the demands of 297 villages in Chamarajnagar and Gundlupet taluks. 

These villages will be provided with clean, safe and potable water when the project gets completed in the next three years. The DC said he has ordered for the rejuvenation of 16 tanks. In his reply, Justice Patil said Chief Minister and ministers do not visit the district fearing losing power.

 “But, you officials continue to work in the district without any hassles.  The bureaucrats must show the leaders that the district is not cursed through their good work and providing basic amenities there,” the Justice said.
