"Operation Lotus was carried out in the state as Congress and JD(S) were luring BJP MLAs to dethrone my Government. That's why it was initiated by BJP," Yeddyurappa told reporters here.

Yeddyurappa has come under attack for luring opposition MLAs and it is learnt that the advisory sent to his government by the Centre recently also makes a mention of it.
BJP managed to poach in about 20 MLAs from JD(S) and Congress by making them resign their Assembly membership and contest the bypolls.ADVERTISEMENT
