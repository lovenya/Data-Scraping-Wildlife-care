Exide Technologies, a major manufacturer of car and truck batteries, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday as it sought to repair its finances amid rising costs for materials and the shutdown of an important operation.

ADVERTISEMENTAs of March 31, Exide had $1.9 billion in assets and $1.1 billion in liabilities, according to a court filing with the federal bankruptcy court in Delaware.

The company will continue to operate normally while in Chapter 11, and has secured $500 million in financing from JPMorgan Chase to keep its operations running. It also named Robert M. Caruso of the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal as its chief restructuring officer.

In a court filing, the company cited the price of scrap lead in North America, which accounts for 40 percent of its costs of goods sold. It has also grappled with intense competition from its primary rival, Johnson Controls, which poached Wal-Mart Stores as an exclusive customer.

Exide had also struggled with its big exposure to the European market, which makes up more than 51 percent of its revenue. The company also faced $31 million in debt interest payments due in August and $51.9 million worth of bonds maturing in September.
