We try to ensure that the animals do not move out of the protected areas to neighbouring villages to reduce human-animal conflict,” she said.Another guard Deepamoni Mili said that sometimes, they have to face unforeseen circumstances and take quick decisions to resolve issues."On several occasions, when the forest guards accompany the tourists during the safari, some animals emerge, and we have to open blank fire to chase them away and take the tourists back to safety,” she said.According to Forest Guard Deepanjali Bora, at times, the animals come too close, while on some occasions, tourists create problems by talking loudly."We have to be strict with the tourists so that animals do not get disturbed and no untoward incident takes place,” she said."The tourists should follow all the rules and regulations so that neither the animals nor the people are disturbed," her colleague Rashmi said.Ghosh pointed out that the women are trained on how to deal with wildlife as well as external forces affecting the conservation process."Once they are recruited, they undergo rigorous training in the police training centres of the state for three months," she said.There is also a forestry and wildlife training module for them, Ghosh added.
