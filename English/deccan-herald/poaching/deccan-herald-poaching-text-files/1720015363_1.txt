He showcased a few of his favourite summertime dishes, including a fresh virgin mango mojito and a lettuce and pear salad with an olive oil and lemon dressing.

The live cooking demo was a very interactive session, as the audience got to taste the dishes that were prepared and could ask food-related questions. 

Many turned up with their notebooks and pens, to take down the few tips and tricks of the trade that Chef Manjit was sharing.

 A total of three dishes were prepared in the demonstration, but the one that stood out the most and got everyone’s taste buds tingling was the poached pears with a red wine reduction. 

Although it sounds complicated, this was not the case. The main idea behind the event was to showcase dishes that could be easily prepared at home, without any struggle.

When he was asked what his favourite summertime ingredients are, he said, “The fruits that you get right now are amazing and tomatoes — they’re healthy and really very tasty.”

The event also included a  lucky draw. The two lucky people who won got a free meal for two. 

The evening ended with the cutting of a cake for the young ones who were present.
“I don’t know anything other than food — it’s everything to me,” said the chef, when asked about his love for food.

This was the first of three similar events that will take place in the City every Friday till May 18. 

The next two cooking demos will have the executive chef of ‘The Great Indian Kebab Factory’ and a sous Chef from ‘Caperberry’.
