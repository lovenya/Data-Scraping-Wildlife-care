With speculation of BJP being invited to form government in Delhi being rife, Home Minister Rajnath Singh today said a call will be taken once formal proposal is received from the Lt Governor even as he dismissed any attempt to form government by poaching MLAs of other parties.

ADVERTISEMENTThe Home Minister who is on a day's trip to the Jammu and Kashmir to assess the flood situation here, said Delhi Lt Governor is free to call any party for government formation and BJP is the single largest party.

"If invited we will think about it. BJP does not believe in horse-trading. BJP will never favour a government with horse-trading," Singh said.

BJP is likely to be invited to form a government in Delhi with Lt Governor Najeeb Jung sending a report to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking permission to call the single largest party to take a shot at power though it is well short of majority in the Assembly.

In his report, Jung gave a detailed analysis of the political situation in the city and underlined the need to have an elected government for Delhi which is under President's rule since February 17 following resignation of AAP government.

Aam Aadmi Party and Congress have come down hard on Jung for his report and accused him of promoting "horse-trading".

Last week the parties had cautioned the Lt Governor not to take any "unconstitutional move" by inviting BJP to form government. Both the parties have been demanding immediate dissolution of the Assembly, saying keeping it in suspended animation will encourage horse-trading.
