The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Monday released a video which showed some BJP leaders allegedly poaching AAP legislators in a bid to form the government in Delhi.

ADVERTISEMENTAccusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of indulging in horse trading "for the last one month", AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal said that he won't allow the party to form a government in Delhi using deceitful tactics.

"The BJP has been wooing our MLA's for the last one month but we will not let them come to power... They are betraying the people of Delhi," Kejriwal.

Delhi has been under President's rule since Kejriwal resigned as chief minister Feb 14 after just 49 days in office.

The BJP won 31 seats in the 70-member house but now has 28 legislators after three were elected to the Lok Sabha in the general elections held April-May.
