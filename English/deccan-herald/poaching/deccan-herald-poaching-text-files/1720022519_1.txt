Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary officials on Saturday arrested two poachers based on footage of camera-traps and have seized a country-made gun.

Of the four poachers, who had poached deer, the officials arrested two — Janu of Marimangala and Venkatesh of Shagya village — and are looking for Raju of Marimangala and Ranga of Shagya.

Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary deputy conservator of forests P Rameshkumar said the suspects had entered the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary on June 30 and were caught committing the crime by the camera-traps installed at several places. Based on the footage, the authorities registered cases against four persons on July 19 and formed a team of officers, led by assistant conservator of forests (ACF) Ankaraju, to nab the culprits. Range forest officer (RFO) B C Lokesh said the arrested confessed to their crime during investigation.
