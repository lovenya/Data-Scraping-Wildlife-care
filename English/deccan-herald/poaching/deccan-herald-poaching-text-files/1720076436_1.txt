Hyderabad: Riding high on the success in last year’s Assembly polls, Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy is now looking at the upcoming Lok Sabha polls as an opportunity to make his position formidable in the Congress as well as in the state politics for which he is leaving no stone unturned and has been working round the clock to ensure the grand old party wins double-digit numbers.ADVERTISEMENTRevanth had come a long way in Congress ever since he joined the party from TDP before the 2018 polls in 2017.  From facing stiff resistance from the senior leaders in the party against his joining to, becoming PCC chief, earning the confidence of party central leadership, and cadres across the state alike, and steering Congress victory for the first time after Telangana was formed, Revanth had reached a certain position in the party. Now, it appears he had set his sights on consolidating his position.Also Read:Electoral bonds nothing but 'quid pro quo', says Telangana CM Revanth ReddyAlso Read:Electoral bonds nothing but 'quid pro quo', says Telangana CM Revanth ReddyFrom formulating winning strategies to inducting strong leaders from other parties wherever needed, Revanth is moving his pawns carefully to ensure Congress wins maximum Lok  Sabha seats.Ever since the announcement of the poll schedule, Revanth has been focusing on politics.In 2019 polls, Congress had won only three out of the total 17 seats.He himself won from Malkajgiri Lok Sabha. Now, he had set a target to ensure more than 14 seats. In some segments, especially in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation region where Congress performance was poor in last year’s Assembly polls, Revanth was successful in poaching strong BRS leaders.He was not only successful in bringing them into the Congress fold but also ensured they got the party ticket convincing the party’s high command. For instance, as soon as sitting MP G Ranjith Reddy, BRS Khairatabad MLA, Danam Naagender, and ZP chairperson, Patnam Suneetha Reddy joined Congress, they were given party tickets to contest from Chevella, Secunderabad and  Malkajgiri segments, respectively.“Until now you had seen an administrator in me in the last few months after I became the CM. From now on you will all see my performance as PCC chief,” asserted  Revanth as soon as the poll schedule was announced. He had also openly announced that the  LS polls would be the referendum on his government’s performance.He has been holding review meetings with party leaders for the last few days. It was decided to set up three-tier party coordination committees at Parliament, Assembly and booth levels across all the 17 segments. In the next 50 days, these committees would work in sync and ensure that the members in the booth-level committees get maximum votes to the party in their respective booths.The same three-tier committee strategy had ensured victory for Revanth Reddy in the 2019 polls from Malkajgiriri, which is considered one of the largest parliament segments in the state. Revanth also promised that post-poll booth-wise result analysis will be done and the members of booth committees where the Congress candidates received more votes than the candidates from other parties will be rewarded by giving them a place in Indiramma committees that will ensure the implementation of government schemes in the respective villages.With BRS on the weak wicket and BJP’s influence only limited to the north Telangana region, Revanth is hoping to create some magic and ensure Congress wins maximum seats.
