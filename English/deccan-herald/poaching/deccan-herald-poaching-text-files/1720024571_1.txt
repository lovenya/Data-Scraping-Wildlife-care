The Indian chapter of animal rights organisation, PETA has questioned the bail granted to actor Salman Khan in blackbuck poaching case. 
  
"While Salman Khan gets to go back home to his movie star life for now, blackbucks were made to pay the highest price, with their lives," Dr Manilal Valliyate, Chief Executive Officer, PETA India, said in a statement.ADVERTISEMENT"PETA India has been involved in a case of a Maharashtra man who killed a langur as his first offence and denied bail a record five times. Salman's case is unusual, these days, wildlife crime matters are commonly fast-tracked, bail is often denied, and offenders regularly receive seven-year prison sentences," he said."If animal abusers now expect to get bail easily or to have their cases dragged out, they are in for a major surprise," he said.
