BJP is neither poaching MLAs from Congress nor JD(S). The party is not engaged in toppling the coalition government. The unholy alliance of Congress and JD(S) will collapse any moment on its own, Udupi-Chikmagalur Lok Sabha MP Shobha Karandlaje said on Monday. ADVERTISEMENT“If Congress and JD(S) MLAs wish to come out of the coalition government to join BJP, then BJP will welcome them,” Shobha told mediapersons in Puttur.The coalition government in the past one year had failed to take up development works. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy had forgotten development works and was engaged in visiting temples and performing puja rituals. The people are disappointed over the performance of the coalition government in the state, she added. Shobha, further, said the people had lost faith in the coalition government. The voters have taught a befitting lesson to the resort and family politics during the Lok Sabha election.She declared that she was not an aspirant for the ministerial post. The MP said, “All the MPs from Karnataka are committed to the decision of the High Command. The people in Karnataka wanted BJP to come to power.”She challenged chief minister and other ministers to tender resignation and seek people’s mandate.Later, Shobha Karandlaje addressing party workers said priority would be given to upgrading national highway and doubling of tracks along Konkan route. Modi-led government is committed to protect the interest of arecanut growers by checking the import and smuggling of arecanut, she added.Shobha accused the state government of failing to utilise the funds released by the Centre.
