Senior BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya on Wednesday denied his party's role in the alleged horse-trading of MLAs supporting the Congress-led Madhya Pradesh government and said the ongoing political developments are a result of "infighting" in the ruling party.ADVERTISEMENTThe BJP national general secretary claimed that many leaders associated with the ruling Congress in the state are in touch with the saffron party.Asked about the Congress' allegations of horse-trading by the BJP, Vijayvargiya told reporters here, "The BJP has nothing to do with this matter. In fact, it is the result of the ongoing infighting among Congress leaders."The BJP leader claimed that whatever is currently happening in the state's politics, shows the "frustration" of the ruling Congress MLAs and their "anger" towards Chief Minister Kamal Nath.Asked about the future of the Kamal Nath government, which has completed 15 months of its tenure (since its formation in December 2018), Vijayvargiya said, "Look, what happens next."He said if the BJP wanted, it could have formed its government in the state after the last Assembly polls because it was "short of only four to five MLAs" and people were ready to come to support it."But we do not believe in these things," he said.Vijayvargiya claimed many leaders associated with the Congress are still in touch with the BJP."Young Congress MLAs, especially, are worried as their party leadership is not good both in Delhi and Bhopal, and in such a situation what will happen to their future?" he said.The senior BJP leader also alleged that the ruling Congress in the state "failed" to keep its promises made to people during the Assembly elections in 2018.In the 230-member Assembly, the Congress has 114 MLAs, followed by the BJP-107. The simple majority mark is 116.The Congress-led state government has the support of four Independent MLAs, two Bahujan Samaj Party legislators and one of the Samajwadi Party.Two seats are currently vacant following the demise of a Congress and a BJP legislator.
