AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal Monday told Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung that the delay in dissolving the Delhi assembly was encouraging the poaching of legislators.

ADVERTISEMENTAfter meeting Jung, Kejriwal tweeted: "We told him that delay in dissolving (the) assembly was encouraging horse trading."

In response to persistent BJP claims that it was in a position to form a government, the former chief minister wanted to know "under what formula could (a) government be formed in Delhi".

Jung had "no answers" to that question, Kejriwal said.

Kejriwal's meeting with Jung came a day after the BJP reiterated that it was willing to form a government in Delhi and was also ready for fresh elections.

Kejriwal met Jung in the company of all his 26 other legislators. The Aam Aadmi Party had won 28 seats in the 70-member assembly but one legislator has since broken ranks.
Kejriwal, who has been accusing the Bhratiya Janata Party of trying to bribe rival legislators, added that he had "good discussions" with Jung.

"Met LG. Had good discussions. He will now invite BJP for discussions. If BJP claims they can form government, LG will ask them to show numbers," he said.

"We presented all MLAs before the LG and told him they were not going anywhere," Kejriwal said. He also wanted to know why the BJP did not seem to be keen on fresh elections.

An AAP source told IANS: "AAP MLAs will not support any party."

Delhi has been under President's Rule after Kejriwal, heading a Congress-backed minority government, resigned as chief minister Feb 14. The BJP now has 28 legislators after three were elected to the Lok Sabha in May.

The Congress has eight seats in the assembly with an effective strength of 67. The lone Akali Dal legislator is a BJP ally. There is a JD-U member, an independent and an AAP rebel.
