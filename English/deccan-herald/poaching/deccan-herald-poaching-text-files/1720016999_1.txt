Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad on Tuesday foiled Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s plan to split his party, a day after nine out of 13 rebel RJD MLAs pledged their loyalty to Nitish and extended support to the Janata Dal-United (JD-U).

ADVERTISEMENTPutting his house in order, Lalu accused the Assembly Speaker to be in cahoots with Nitish and acting at the behest of the JD-U strongman.

“I hold Nitish and the Speaker equally responsible for the rebellion,” said Lalu, who doused the fire within 24 hours of revolt.

“Nine out of the 13 MLAs have returned to the RJD. Another MLA Raghvendra Pratap Singh is on his way. This leaves three ‘rebel MLAs’ who will be eventually issued show-cause notices,” said Lalu as he marched the nine MLAs to the Speaker’s chamber.

Since the Speaker was not present, Lalu submitted a memorandum to the Assembly secretary protesting the Speaker’s notification on Monday which had identified the 13 rebel MLAs as a ‘separate group’. Presenting the nine MLAs before the media, Lalu charged Nitish with indulging in the worst form of poaching since he was running a minority government. 

“He lured my MLAs with ministerial berths and offers to contest Lok Sabha elections on JD-U ticket. But except three MLAs, all the legislators have stood by me like a rock,” said Lalu as he travelled from Assembly to Raj Bhavan in a rickshaw, followed by partymen.

At Raj Bhavan, he submitted a memorandum to Governor D Y Patil, accusing Nitish and the Speaker of trying to split the RJD.
