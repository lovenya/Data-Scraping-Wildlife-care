Instead, all he wanted was for the court to permit him to go with an escort to vote in exercise of constitutional right. Justice Naik, however, refused to grant him relief saying that though Malik had not used the word "bail", the tenor of his plea was that of one seeking bail under section 439 of the CrPC and therefore, his court was not the appropriate one for grant of bail.Malik's counsel Amit Desai had argued before Justice Naik that "lables must not be looked at when the High Court had wide jurisdiction and important issues were to be decided"."I am only pressing for a constitutional order to be passed to enable me to go cast my vote," Desai had said."The real issue is that the special court has interpreted the law in a particular manner which has large consequences on voting as the constitutional right of elected representatives," he had said. Justice Naik however refused relief saying that Malik was "deliberately " avoiding the word bail."He is an undertrial. Your bail is rejected by the special court. How is it maintainable here? Even if one is released on surety bond, the source of releasing one is bail only. Now you can't say you are not pressing for bail but only alternate prayer. How can you do that?" Justice Naik had said. The ED opposed Malik's pleas saying the same were not maintainable.In this election, every vote is crucial for the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), of which the NCP is a constituent, to get the Sena's second candidate - Sanjay Pawar - elected.
