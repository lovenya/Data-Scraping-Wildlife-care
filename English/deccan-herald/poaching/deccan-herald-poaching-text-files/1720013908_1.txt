The carcass of the tiger was found last night, Rajasthan Forest Minister Ramlal Jat said today.He said injury marks indicate that the tiger might have been killed in a territorial fight. However, the exact cause of death will be clear only after a post-mortem.
The Sariska tiger reserve in Rajasthan lost all its tigers by 2004-05, mostly to widespread poaching.

In a bid to revive tiger population in the reserve, three tigers — a male and two females — were shifted from Ranthambore reserve, also in Rajasthan, in 2008 and 2009.
However, they failed to produce any offspring and it was later found that they were siblings.After an intense genetic analysis, a tiger and a tigress were translocated this year.ADVERTISEMENT
