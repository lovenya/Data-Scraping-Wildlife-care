Bollywood on Thursday rallied behind actor Salman Khan, who has been handed out a five-year jail term by a Jodhpur court in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case.ADVERTISEMENTMost of the Bollywood personalities questioned the delay in the verdict and petitioned that the humanitarian work done by the 52-year-old actor needs to be considered."I feel bad. He should be given relief. He has done a lot of humanitarian work through Being Human," Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan said.Showman Subhash Ghai, who has worked with Salman in several films, said he was shocked. "I am shocked that Salman Khan was convicted but also having full trust in Indian judiciary which has many other doors to appeal for final justice whatsoever. Since he is the most loved person by industry and people for his human reasons too," he said.Actor and presenter Raza Murad also questioned the verdict. "Why is it coming after 20 years?".Actor Arjun Rampal said in a tweet that the decision seemed a bit "too harsh".  "The law takes its course. Can't argue it. But at this point in time,  I just feel helpless and my heart goes out to @BeingSalmanKhan and his family.  The reason, cause the last thing @BeingSalmanKhan is, is a criminal. I feel this is too harsh. I do hope he gets the relief he deserves," tweeted actor Arjun Rampal.According to Alok Nath, who was a co-actor in Hum Saath Saath Hain, "It is a judgement of a court, we cannot comment. However, we need to think about issues like the delay in the verdict and the good work done by Salman."Singer Sona Mohapatra was critical of the film industry. "Will daddy say sorry on his behalf? What will the suck-ups in the industry do? When's bail? When's the next blockbuster release? Dabangg'concert' tour dates? Big Boss? Charity drives?" she tweeted.
