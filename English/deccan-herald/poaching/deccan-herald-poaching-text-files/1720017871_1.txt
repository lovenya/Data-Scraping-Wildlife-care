Underscoring the need to regulate the elephant population in the State, Mysore-based Nature Conservation Foundation’s A J T Johnsingh, called for adopting African model of immunocontraception rather than culling. 

ADVERTISEMENTStating that the proposal was also mentioned in the task force report two years ago for conserving elephants, he said, under the African model, the female jumbo is darted and given drug curtailing breeding for three years. In this way, the animal is not lost and population is also under control.

Noting that the State boasted of a healthy elephant population, he said, it was imperative to collect photographic details and monitoring them, to check rampant poaching for ivroy. The forest department could take up the task with its staff provided special cameras and incentives for the purpose, he said, adding there was also urgent need to have full time director, with five year tenture, to address these issues. 

Johnsingh was in City as part of global march for elephants and rhino from Queens Road to Raj Bhavan, under Conservation of Asian Elephants & Great Indian One-Horned Rhino programme, organsied by Asian Nature Conservation Foundation.
