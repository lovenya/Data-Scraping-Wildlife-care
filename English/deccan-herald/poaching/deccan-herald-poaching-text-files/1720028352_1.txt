Coalition coordination committee chairperson Siddaramaiah on Thursday came down heavily on the BJP, especially its state president B S Yeddyurappa, for “trying to dislodge” the Congress-JD(S) government.ADVERTISEMENT“People have given us the mandate to rule for five years. The coalition was formed as there was a fractured mandate. Yeddyurappa had his chance, but failed to prove majority on the floor of the House and resigned. But ever since, he has been trying to dislodge this government,” Siddaramaiah told reporters, after a breakfast meeting with Congress ministers.The Congress-JD(S) coalition enjoys majority on the floor of the House, Siddaramaiah pointed out. “What does a democracy require? A majority, a number... we have that.”The recent results of the Lok Sabha elections in the state, which the BJP swept, had no impact on the government, he asserted.All Congress ministers, he said, were united in the need to keep the coalition government intact. “All our ministers and MLAs are together. No MLA will quit the party,” he said. “We have no fear of Operation Lotus (poaching). It is the BJP that is in fear as they are out of power,” he said.Asked about Congress’ rebel Ramesh Jarkiholi, Siddaramaiah said, “We’re talking to him. We’ll try to convince him against resigning. He won’t quit the party.”
