The animal was weighing 13.5 kg. They purchased the animal by offering Rs 2,000 to the fisherman.

They handed over the animal to the Forest Department and it was later released to a tank near Agumbe.  Forest Department officials told Deccan Herald that the turtle is rarely sighted as its population has dwindled owing to poaching and loss of habitation

 Fishermen said they happen to net the turtle once in three-four years.  Kenneth Harsha and his friends visited the fishermen hamlet near Gajanur and urged them not to poach the turtle.
