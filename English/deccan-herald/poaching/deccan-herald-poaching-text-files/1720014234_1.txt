To avoid poaching by the BJP, both the parties have taken their members on a tour. In the 34-seat panchayat, the Congress has 14 and the JD(S) has four members. 

The BJP has a strength of 16. All the 18 members of the Cong-JD(S) combine were in Dharmasthala on Tuesday and will return on the day of elections to the president and vice-president’s post.

Bangalore Urban District Congress Committee president H M Revanna said that the BJP tried to split the Congress members. All the members are united and BJP’s efforts will not yield any result, he asserted.ADVERTISEMENT
