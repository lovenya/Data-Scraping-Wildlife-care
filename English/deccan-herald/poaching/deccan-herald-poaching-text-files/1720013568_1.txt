Ministers R Ashoka, Janardhana Reddy, Umesh Katti, Basavaraj Bommai, Govind Karjol and Jagadish Shettar, addressing a joint press conference, here on Wednesday, said that the Congress and the JD(S) leaders were worried over their MLAs quitting the party. 

The Congress leaders protest in front of the CM’s residence showed their frustration and helplessness to keep their MLAs with them, they said. 

They further said that Congress leaders had no moral right to protest so. Minister Ashoka said it was the Congress and the JD(S) that wooed 11 BJP MLAs and attempted to destabilise the government. 

The disqualified MLAs had called him several times pleading for their release from the clutches of the Opposition parties, he claimed. He further said BJP workers would stage a protest in front of the resort on Thursday, if the disqualified MLAs were not released immediately. 

Reacting to allegations that the BJP lured Congress and JD(S) MLAs by offering huge cash, Ashoka wanted to know whether the Congress and JD(S) offered tamarind seeds to 11 BJP MLAs, who shifted their loyalty. 

Asked why can’t he as Home Minister ensure the release of disqualified MLAs, he said he would act at the right time.

Answering a query, Ashoka said it was the Congress that initiated poaching of Opposition party MLAs. S M Krishna had poached seven opposition MLAs during his regime as the CM, he said.
