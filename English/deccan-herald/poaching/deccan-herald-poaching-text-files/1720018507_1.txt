Superstar Salman Khan's woes in relation to the ongoing illegal arms case may come to an end soon as the court has granted the prosecution one last chance to produce witnesses.

ADVERTISEMENTThe final verdict in the case was to be delivered by the Jodhpur court yesterday, on Mar 3.

However, the court had to deffer the hearing to a further date as the prosecution sought permission to re-examine some of the witnesses.

This time, the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Anupama Bijlani has made it clear to the prosecution that no further dates will be granted for producing witnesses and records.

Detailing about the court orders, Salman's counsel Hastimal Saraswat said, "The court also ordered the prosecution to call four witnesses on March 10 as a last chance." 

Actor Salman Khan and some other actors have been accused of poaching black bucks during the shooting of 'Hum Saath Saath Hain', in October 1998.

Salman has also been accused of possessing arms with expired license and using the same for poaching black bucks.
