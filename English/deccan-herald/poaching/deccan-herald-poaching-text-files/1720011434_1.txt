Amar Singhji is playing an important role of a musician in the movie along with actor-dancer Neelambari Perumal who is the lead actress as well as Dimple Kapadia,’’ Pradeep told Deccan Herald. The film focuses on the contemporary issue of youths indulging in the smuggling and poaching of rare animals and birds which are ‘believed’ to bring in fortune.

Pradeep says Amar Singhji was quite taken in by the novelty of the theme and offered about a week to complete his shoot in March next year. The film’s cast is led by local heartthrob Vinu Mohan and Telugu actor Venkatesh as well as comedians Jagathy Sreekumar and Harisree Asokan. However, the focus has been on the beautiful Neelambari Perumal, daughter of Sri Lankan Tamil leader Varadaraja Perumal, a former chief minister of North East Provincial Council. Familiar in Delhi as an NGO activist and theatre actor, Neelambari plays a young journalist living in north India who decides to go back to her roots in South India to uncover the mystery behind a murder. The 53-year-old Amar Singh has acted in four films earlier.
