Water Resources Minister D K Shivakumar on Tuesday denied interfering with the affairs of the Belagavi district, a charge the Jarkiholi brothers have repeatedly levelled against him.ADVERTISEMENT“I have not interfered with the Belagavi district and I don’t know why this is being talked about,” Shivakumar claimed, reacting to former minister Satish Jarkiholi’s accusation.Shivakumar showered praise on Satish.“He is a dedicated party worker who has slogged to build the party. I have visited Belagavi several times. I will go whenever I’m invited to take part in the events there. I will go wherever they (Jarkihols) call me. I’m here to help them,” he said.Shivakumar even welcomed Municipalities Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi’s projection of his brother Satish as chief ministerial candidate. “What’s wrong in that. It’s good. In politics, one must have aspiration and goals,” said Shivakumar, a CM-aspirant himself.  The minister also hit out at the BJP amid reports that the saffron party was trying to poach the Congress legislators. “Are they taking names of our legislators? You will be shocked if I name BJP legislators. This is a game of chess. Let them make a move and we will move our pawn,” he said.
