Though the JD(S) was the first to announce its list of 126 candidates on February 17, it has, however, resorted to adopting a wait-and-watch policy before releasing its second list.ADVERTISEMENTBut, it is now said that the party may not announce the second list and would directly start issuing ‘B’ forms to its candidates, many of whom will be late entrants and disgruntled leaders from the Congress and the BJP.For, the BJP is yet to announce 70 more candidates. Also, both the Congress and the BJP are said to introduce changes to their respective lists until the last minute.Candidates have time until April 24 to file their nominations.Given the scenario, JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda is said to be in no hurry to announce the second list, as he would want to poach as many disgruntled BJP and Congress aspirants to his party.He has also claimed that disgruntled leaders from the national parties will continue to join his party till April 24.When contacted, Gowda, however, said that his party would announce the second list in a couple of days. But, he did not deny that many leaders might have to be given B-forms directly. “Kumaraswamy is in Madikeri -- once he is back, we will announce the list. But some changes will have to be made to the list -- it’s inevitable,” he added.On Tuesday, former BJP MLA from Chickpet in Bengaluru, Dr Hemachandra Sagar joined the JD(S), as he was denied the ticket from Chickpet. Dr Sagar will be JD(S)’s Chickpet candidate. Former Congress leader P Ramesh too officially joined the party. The party has decided to field him from C V Raman Nagar.It is also learnt that the party might field former BJP corporator G H Ramachandra from Rajarajeshwari Nagar. Another local leader from the constituency, H Hanumantharayappa (father-in-law of deceased IAS officer D K Ravi) of the Congress too will join the JD(S) on April 20.Meanwhile, vexed BJP leaders such as Shashil Namoshi and Belur Gopalakrishna are said to be in touch with the JD(S).While Namoshi was hoping for the ticket from Gulbarga North, Gopalakrishna was vying for one from Sagar in Shivamogga.
