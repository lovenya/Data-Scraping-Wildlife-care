After being denied the first time, actor Salman Khan has finally got the UK visa and he will be flying to London to shoot for upcoming film "Kick".

ADVERTISEMENT"He will be flying to London," sources close to the actor told PTI.

Salman would be leaving for London in a week's time. The 47-year-old actor was denied the visa because some papers related to the poaching case against him did not reach on time to fulfill visa requirements, his father Salim had said.

"The visa was denied to him because some papers from Jodhpur were not there...the papers had not come. All this has happened because of a technical glitch," Salim had said.

Salman has a court case stemming from the illegal hunting of blackbuck in Rajasthan during the shoot of 'Hum Saath Saath Hain' in 1998.

He has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder in 2002 hit-and-run case. The actor could face up to 10 years in jail if convicted
