Three persons, wanted in several cases of wild life poaching and smuggling in Maharashtra, were arrested and parts of a tiger carcass worth several crores of rupees in the international market were seized from their possession, police said on Monday. 

ADVERTISEMENTActing on a tip-off, two of the accused, Suraj Bhan and Naresh were arrested yesterday by a team of Delhi Police Crime branch, Forest Conservative Department, Maharashtra and Wild Life Crime Control Bureau near Chandgi Ram Akhara area, they said.

The team had inputs that the duo would be coming in a car near the GTK by-pass via ISBT Kashmiri Gate to hand over the items to Surajpal. Later, on their directions, Surajpal was nabbed and Rs 50 lakh in cash and tiger nails were recovered from his house in Adarsh Nagar, police said.

During interrogation, Bhan and his aide Naresh confessed to have purchased the animal’s carcass parts, consisting of skull, nails and bones, from a herdsman from Nagina in Uttar Pradesh, and were to deliver the items to Surajpal.“Two cases have been registered this year at Amrawati and Nagpur in Maharashtra,”said Yadav.
