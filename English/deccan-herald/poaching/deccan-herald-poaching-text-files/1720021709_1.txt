A Jodhpur court on Friday summoned actors Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Tabu to appear before it on January 25 in the blackbuck poaching case. Chief Judicial Magistrate Dalpat Singh gave these directions after the completion of examination of all the witnesses in the court. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe verdict in the case against Salman under the Arms Act will be pronounced on January 18. 

On July 25, 2016, the Rajasthan High Court acquitted Salman in the 1998 poaching cases, saying there was no evidence to prove that the animals were shot dead with the actorâ€™s licensed gun.
