They are charging that the BJP is poaching, but actually it is the Congress which is doing all kinds of efforts," he said.Javadekar accused the Congress of offering ministerial berths to rebel MLAs and giving other "lollipops".It is an internal party problem as those MLAs who have resigned have blamed their own leadership, Javadekar said.Congress members on Wednesday disrupted proceedings in the Upper House for the second day over the Karnataka crisis and accused the BJP of trying to destabilise its coalition government with the JD(S) there.
