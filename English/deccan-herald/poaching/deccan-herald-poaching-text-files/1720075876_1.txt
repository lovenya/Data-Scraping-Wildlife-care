They also went to meet Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena to lodge a complaint.Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri was asked by the deputy speaker in the House to reply if Mahawar did the video recording or not. On her repeated questioning, Bidhuri claimed that ruling party MLAs also resorted to video recording during Assembly sessions.With no reply to her question, Birla ordered them to be marshalled out."We wanted a discussion on the excise policy scam but our requests were turned down. That is why we are protesting at the Gandhi statue demanding the immediate removal of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia from the Kejriwal cabinet."He claimed that the opposition MLAs were marshalled out because the AAP government has no answers to the BJP's questions on the alleged liquor scam.Participating in a discussion over the Kejriwal government's work in different sectors, Sisodia said the Excise Policy 2021-22 did not cause any burden on the consumers and it increased revenue, but the BJP was alleging corruption in it.The special session began with the House observing a two-minute silence to pay homage to ITBP soldiers killed in a bus accident in Pahalgam last month.
