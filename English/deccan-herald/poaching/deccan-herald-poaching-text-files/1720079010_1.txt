No one from our party will leave, he said.To a query on the differences between himself and H C Mahadevappa, Shivaraj clarified that it was true that he had written a letter to the Social Welfare Minister over the appointment of an officer for Koppal. "It does not mean that there are differences because I wrote a letter. As there are allegations against the officer, I had written that such an officer is not needed to our district. He is a senior minister and I hope he will respond to the issue," Shivaraj said.
