Now, transplant that image to the American prairie. In one of the most startling new ideas to emerge about climate change, a leading conservation biologist is calling for plants and wildlife facing extinction to be saved simply by picking them up and moving them. 

Camille Parmesan, a butterfly­biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, has been monitoring the effects of rapid climate change on species – particularly those threatened because they cannot adapt to or escape from rising temperatures – for more than a decade now. But her idea for a modern day Noah’s ark remains hugely controversial.

Transplant animals and plants
Her proposals, once confined to a handful of scientists, are now getting a broader airing as governments begin to grapple with the problem of how to insulate animal and plant life from a warming climate. 

Scientists have long believed that 20 pc to 30 pc of all known species of land animal, bird and fish could become extinct because of climate change. But recent studies, based on more elevated temperature projections, have suggested an even greater rate of die-off – 40 pc to 70 pc – as heatwaves, drought and the increasing acidification of the oceans drive animals from their native habitats and destroy their food supply.

The sheer scale of threatened extinctions have forced conservationists to rethink what was once dismissed as an outlandish notion. And it’s got Parmesan thinking about elephants. To date, there is little evidence about how climate change – rather than traditional threats such as poaching or growing urbanisation – is affecting the grasslands where these majestic creatures live in the wild. “But at some point, I think we might want to think about moving them around,” Parmesan says.

She has already been pushing for efforts to regenerate America’s prairie grasslands in parts of Texas and the mid-west, by bringing in big grazing animals. There are fossils to suggest there were elephants in North America tens of thousands of years ago. So why not transplant African elephants to North America?

“With climate change, I am starting to think that, if we do get a massive reduction of Africa’s grassland, then as I am advocating restoration of the US prairie anyway, we can use the large herbivores from Africa to help that process because they are already co-adapted. I wouldn’t be opposed to that.”

Parmesan can see her way to moving other big herbivores too, such as giraffes. She can even justify finding new homes for pandas. “What we are advocating is not moving tigers to Africa, nor moving polar bears to Antarctica – nothing as dramatic as that – but (on the whole) to take species that are fairly innocuous, including a lot of plants and insects,” she says. 

Climate studies since 2000 reveal a growing threat to animal life far beyond the polar regions that have been feeling its early impacts. A review of recent scientific literature showed 52 pc of species striking out for more temperate areas as their traditional habitats became unsuitable, migrating from 50 km to as far as 1,600 km away when geography and human settlements allowed.

Climate change is also altering their way of life: some 62 pc of species, for example, are mating earlier in the spring. If it were up to her, the evacuation would start now – perhaps with a variety of the ephemeral checker­spot butterfly which started her on this unlikely career path. 

Earlier researchers – including her husband, Singer – had established that the Checkerspot was sensitive to temperature. The trek convinced Parmesan that it was dying out because of climate change: rising temperatures in California were drying up the plant that was its main food source, although the butterfly continued to do fine in northern latitudes. And yet Parmesan admits she was, at first, sceptical about projections of the broader impacts of climate change on the animal world.

When Parmesan first began talking about moving species, or “assisted­colonisation”, at academic conferences, her fellow biologists erupted. They accused her of playing God; of tampering with nature in ways that carry enormous risk. They warned that her approach would set off a whole new chain of problems. How did Parmesan know the transplants would take to their new surroundings? How did she know they would not stage a hostile takeover, chasing out the native species?

Unlike traditional threats to wildlife, Parmesan says there is no prospect of recovery from climate change. Loss of habitat and poaching can be reversed, given enough money. Threatened animals can be coaxed back to healthy numbers – as in the case of the wolf in the Rocky Mountain West region of the US. Degraded landscapes can be restored. But climate change is irreversible. And besides, it’s not as if there hasn’t been transportation of animal or plant life in the past.

Start small
“It doesn’t make any sense to say it’s OK for the shipping industry,  transport industry to accidentally move stuff around, the aquarium or garden trade to move stuff all over the place, but that it’s not OK for a conservation biologist who is desperately trying to save a species from extinction to move it 100 miles. Come on, we have mucked around with Earth to such a degree that I think it’s a ridiculous argument.”

Their idea is to start small – with plants, butterflies, birds, small rodents, and mammals – and to restrict the relocation plan to isolated spots that are immediately threatened by climate change. That is, high-altitude species that are being forced to migrate higher and higher up mountains to find cooler temperatures. Parmesan would shift those populations to another, higher mountain within close range.

Even with temperature rises of 0.7C, some animals have already been lost – such as the golden toad of Costa Rica (biologists there have warned that more than a dozen amphibian species have disappeared from the jungles because of climate change). Last year, Australian researchers reported what would be the world’s first mammalian extinction of modern times: the lemuroid ringtail possum. These animals drop out of trees and die if the temperature rises above 30C – although subsequent reports suggest a number have since been sighted.

 In the American west, researchers have charted a sharp decline in the pika, a small, furry brown animal that lives in the Rocky mountains. As for the polar bear, its natural hunting grounds are fast disappearing with the melting sea ice.
