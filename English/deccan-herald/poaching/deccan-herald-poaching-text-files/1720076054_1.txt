There is a belief that rhino horns contain medicinal properties, including aphrodisiacs, even as the same has been strongly rejected by researchers and scientists.The Kaziranga, a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985, is one of the major tourist attractions mainly due to the one-horned rhinos. The latest census of rhinos in 2018 found 2,413 rhinos in KNP, which is the highest in the world.Watch the latest DH Videos here:
