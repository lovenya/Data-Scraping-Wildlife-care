Red Fork in Indiranagar offers a range of contemporary items. Though it provides great breakfast options, burgers and salads, it is mainly known for the delicious Parsi food it serves. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe menu here is carefully curated to capture the seasonal produce from organic, zero pesticide farms. Even the in-house breads, desserts, compotes, dips and ice-creams are completely fresh. Chef Xerxes and his team come up with innovative presentations too.

Run by a Parsi family, the place used to be called Daddy’s Deli before it was given a new identity. 

The elaborate breakfast menu consists of a spring onion pancake with smoked salmon and poached egg; breakfast bruschetta with pork; big breakfast with a choice of fried, poached or scrambled eggs; a choice of chicken franks or bacon served with rosemary mushrooms, hash cake and choice of bread, green eggs and ham. There is a wide range of salads available from beetroot, walnut tamarind dressing with house marinated feta to pear parmesan and almond salad. 

The filling burgers include chicken Bondi burger with apple tzatziki salad; bacon and cheese and beef patty with cheddar, bacon, jalapeños, spanish onion jam, gherkins, mayo and barbecue sauce. 

  Some of the delicious dishes offered here are beef tenderloin with Thai style salad and Miso-glazed pan-fried fish on a bed of sesame rice. 

The mouth-watering desserts here include orange semolinacake with Cognac ganache and vanilla ice cream; carrot cake with sugared almonds and mascarpone sorbet; baked white chocolate cheesecake with toffee and spiced poached pears.  Red Fork is located on 12th Main, HAL 2nd Stage, Indiranagar.
