Known as Delhi’s finest French bakery and patisserie, L’Opéra recently launched around 15 new cakes and pastries to celebrate its five years in Delhi NCR. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe range, which has been crafted by multiple award-winning Chef Amit Sinha, includes treats like gluten-free ‘Pabana Gateaux’ with tropical fruits banana, mango, passion fruit and coconut, a special blend of poached apple and caramel mousse named the silky smooth Berrilla Delight, ‘Salty Caramel Eclair’, ‘Coffee Tart’ and ‘Chocolate Raspberry Tart’ among others.

“Prepared according to traditional recipes, we are looking to cater to diversified tastes of passionate sweets lovers because we feel there is huge room for creativity in patisserie,” executive chairman Kazem Samandari, tells Metrolife. 

If you are a coffee lover, the new bite-sized ‘Coffee Tart’ with ‘its sablé biscuit’ and the nuttiness of the almond glaze is worth a try.

Much like their name which refers to multilayer chocolate and coffee French pastry, their signature delight ‘Royal Chocolate’ doesn’t disappoint. It has been redesigned with silky Belgian dark chocolate mousse, a delightfully crunchy base and luscious caramel chocolate ganache. 

“When I thought of our classic designs, such as that of the ‘Mille Feuille’ and our customers’ favourite ingredient, chocolate, a ‘Chocolate Mille Feuille’ seemed like the way 
to go,” confesses chef Sinha. Other ones to try are ‘Paris Brest’, ‘Chocolate Éclair’, ‘Chocolate Trio’ and ‘Silky Tropics’.  

Alongside, they have also launched six new chocolates in all of their 13 outlets, namely — Foret Noir, Lemon Delight, Cinnamon Strawberry, Butter Caramel, Hazelnut Rocher and Rumnana Fantasy.
