In the wake of the good results, following the installation of 18 low-noise solar powered water pumps across Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, the Forest department has decided to add five more such water pumps, shortly, to check the straying of wild animals in search of water to human habitations.ADVERTISEMENTAssistant Conservator of Forests S R Prasanna Kumar, said that at present, most of the lakes and tanks inside the forests have sufficient water, despite failed rains across the forests wherever the pumps have been installed."Last year, out of the 18 pumps installed inside the forests, five had been donated by some companies under corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes. Each unit, comprising the borewell, motor, and solar panels, cost Rs 7 lakh. They have been installed on the banks of lakes and tanks and the water is usually pumped into the waterbody from 9 am to 5 pm, when the sun shines," he said.'Rain not adequate'Kumar said that earlier when the monsoon was normal, there was no problem for water in the forests."Of late, the monsoons are not adequate. So, we cannot take chances as man-animal conflict will increase if the water bodies dry up. Besides, water in the lakes and tanks also takes care of the drinking water needs of the Forest department personnel in anti-poaching camps and also fire-watchers on patrol."Last year, the solar pumps had been installed under Anechowkur, Hunsur, Veeranahosahalli, Metikuppe, Antharasanthe and other ranges of forests. This year, again the new pumps will be added under Metikuppe, Antharasanthe and Veeranahosahalli ranges, at places, where the need was felt," he said.Water availableRange Forest Officer of Mathigodu Y K Kiran Kumar said, "Now, water is available at 350 to 450 feet depth. The water level may increase once the monsoon sets in. Compared to previous years, the animals straying out, in search of water, has reduced over the past one year."
