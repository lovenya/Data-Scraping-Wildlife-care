“This is the first educational film on tigers and their conservation and I believe that it will answer many of the doubts that people have, and present them with a road map on how to save the tiger. There will be several public screenings of the film in places across India,” said Dattatri. Packed with stunning visuals, superb narration (by Roshan Seth) and rare footage, it captures the moments in a tiger's life, from the time of birth to its death, untimely or otherwise. The film holds the attention of the audience from the word go.

The tragedy of the Indian tiger lies in the fact that despite being accorded national animal status, it is being ruthlessly hunted by organised poaching gangs to supply tiger skins, bones and organs to China and other Asian countries. The skins are used for decorative purposes and the bones and organs are used in the preparation and sale of traditional medicines largely based on superstitious beliefs. 

Even the wildlife reserves in India do not provide enough safety for the tiger who is hunted down by highly professional tribal poaching gangs.

“Tigers have their place in the larger ecosystem and are an integral part of a food chain where everything plays its part. We need to become aware of our duties towards this magnificent animal mainly by strengthening the rule of law,” said Ashish Mitra, an environmentalist present at the screening. The documentary focuses the viewers’ attention on the fact that the bureaucracy is not in a position to tackle poachers with the determination and ruthlessness they deserve. As the staff are under-trained and under-equipped, the government must be pressured to upgrade facilities, protect the forests and safeguard the remaining tiger population before they become totally extinct.
