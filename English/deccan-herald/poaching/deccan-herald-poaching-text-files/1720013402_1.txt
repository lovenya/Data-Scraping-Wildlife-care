The protest came on the eve of the anticipated hearing by Justice V G Sabhahit of the Karnataka High Court in the matter pertaining to the disqualification of MLAs. 

Triggered by rumours about the Jagalur MLA S V Ramachandra falling prey to BJP's bait and alleged attempts to entice 40 other MLAs, the Congress went on the offensive, targeting Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa.ADVERTISEMENTAccompanied by some 100 supporters, the party leaders including R V Deshpande, D K Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah and Ugrappa, attempted to storm into residence of the Chief Minister, but were foiled by police. Finally, the Congress leaders and their supporters sat on a dharna and courted arrest.

Police bundled the Congressmen into three police vans and drove them to makeshift jails in their headquarters at CPRÂ  at Adugodi, which incidentally is also a dog training centre, and CPRM on Mysore Road. The protest ended peacefully, without posing much law and order problem.

Traffic on Race Course Road towards Chalukya Circle was affected badly, compelling the travellers to take a diversion and reach their destination.
