High Court former judge Justice M F Saldanha on Saturday demanded ban on export of beef to conserve livestock in coastal region.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing mediapersons here, Saldanha, quoting statistics, said, “India is the largest global exporter of beef with unabated cattle poaching in coastal region adding to the alarming situation.”

Saldanha, who claimed to have been keeping a close tab on developments in the region, said, “There has been unabated cattle poaching numbering about 20,000 to 30,000 in the recent years and yet the conviction rate in such cases is zero.”

He demanded a strong campaign to promote vegetarian food habits. Even in foreign countries most of the people have taken to vegetarian food. It is imperative as the state has large cattle population and daily 4,000 to 8,000 cattles are being smuggled to Kerala, he added.

Saldanha also pooh-poohed the belief that there has been an increase in the number of people liking non-vegetarian food. In reality, Saldanha said, “There has been an increase in number of meat eaters.”

Expressing concern over unscientific fishing, Saldanha said, “If it continues, fish may disappear in next four to five years’.

Taking cognisance of French-made ‘purseile’ fishing net used by fishermen, Saldanha said it is doing more harm than traditional nets as fishlings are caught in it. With the number of fish already drastically coming down, it will have a cascading effect in future, he expressed apprehension.
