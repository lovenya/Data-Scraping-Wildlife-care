"There is not a single party in the state, which can assure that its candidate will not join the BJP. In 2019, as many as 10 Congress MLAs had joined the BJP," he said.Palekar said that Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, who had figured in the first list of candidates of the Congress, has joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC), which is also contesting all the seats in Goa. "Another Congress candidate is also likely join the BJP soon. Such poaching in the state indicates that the ruling BJP has learned that majority wins cannot be achieved," he added.Palekar said that to resolve this problem, AAP candidates will sign affidavits, which will be distributed among their voters, assuring them they would not join any other party. "If they do so, voters can take a legal action against them," he added. As soon as the AAP announces its candidate, they will sign the affidavits, Palekar said. "If a candidate quits AAP and joins another party, they are immediately disqualified as MLAs," he said.Check out DH's latest videos:
