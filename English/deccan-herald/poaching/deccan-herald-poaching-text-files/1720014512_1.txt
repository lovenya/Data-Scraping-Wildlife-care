The onslaught of elephants and other wild animals had wreaked havoc on the lives of residents between 2006 and  2009. 

After its other plans to check the increasing incidents of elephant raids did not work,  the Forest department installed solar fences in 2009 across 189 km, including the buffer zone in the Park. Now, elephants are discouraged from crossing the fences, said Deputy Conservator of Forests Dr Hanumanthappa.

Since the installation of solar fences, farmers in the border villages are able to cultivate crops peacefully. In several places, farmers themselves guard solar fences and also undertake repairs on time. As a result, in 2010-11 only one case of elephant attack has been registered, he added.

“After the installation of fences, several forest paths have been created across the Park. Every six km, a small room is constructed for a temporary staff, who is equipped with the latest equipment to keep a check on the onslaught by animals,” said Hanumanthappa.
Vigilance squads and more than 50 forest guards have been deployed to check poaching and looting of the forest resources, he said.

The Chhattisgarh Forest Minister, who visited the Park, recently was impressed by the installation of solar fences to tackle elephant attacks and decided to take up similar projects  in his State, said the DCF. 

Senior officers Hosmat and B K Singh have played pivotal role in implementing the project, which will soon be extended to the Begur Omkar zone, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
