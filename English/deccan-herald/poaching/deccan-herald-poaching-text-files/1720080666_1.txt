Amidst speculations that BJP was making another attempt to form the government by toppling the Congress-JD(S) coalition, the saffron party’s top leadership huddled here with state leaders on Monday.ADVERTISEMENTWith reports that six to eight Congress MLAs are ready to jump ship to the BJP side and some lawmakers of the ruling coalition have gone incommunicado, the BJP state leaders have kept their MLAs in the national capital for the past few days, under the close watch of senior leaders - Yeddyurappa, Jagadish Shettar and Shobha Karandlaje.    All BJP MLAs who came to attend the party’s national conference were kept in Karnataka Bhavan and nearby hotels. On Monday evening, they were shifted to a five-star hotel in Gurugram and told to stay in the national capital for two more days.Despite the party claiming that they were holding the MLAs to discuss Lok Sabha poll strategy, no such meeting was held on Monday.The party is keeping its MLAs under a close watch to prevent counter operation by Congress-JD(S), sources said.Alleging that Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy was trying to poach BJP MLAs by offering huge money and ministership, Yeddyurappa said, “despite having a majority, the Congress-JD(S) combine is trying to lure our MLAs and is indulging in horse-trading, BJP is not doing it. We, with our 104 MLAs, are ready to work as Opposition peacefully.” READ MORE Cong ministers offer to quit, JD(S) plots hardDKS off to Mumbai with tricks up his sleeve
