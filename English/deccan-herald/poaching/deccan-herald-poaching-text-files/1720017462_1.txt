The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought a response from actor Salman Khan on an appeal filed by Rajasthan government against a high court decision, which stayed his conviction and five-year jail term in a black buck hunting case.

ADVERTISEMENTA bench presided over by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya issued notice to Khan, seeking his reply within four weeks.

The state government approached the apex court against the order of Rajasthan High Court which had, on November 12, 2013, stayed his 2006 conviction by the trial court in the case, paving the way for him to apply for a British visa.

Under British immigration rules, any person convicted for more than four years is not eligible for a visa. Since the actor was convicted for five years, he was denied visa by the UK Embassy. 

Salman was convicted and sentenced to one-year and five-year prison terms in separate cases of poaching of two Chinkaras at Bhawad and one black buck at Ghoda Farm (Mathania) on the intervening nights of September 26-27, 1998 and September 28-29, 1998 respectively. The black buck is a protected animal and hunting it is a punishable offence.

The actor had approached the high court in 2007 seeking a stay on his conviction by a trial court so that he could file a fresh application for a British visa. Besides Salman, actors Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Tabu and Neelam were accused of poaching near Jodhpur during the shooting of the film “Hum Saath Saath Hain”.
