In a suspected case of foul play, five deer and seven wild goats were found dead at Neelagiri plantation in Nagarhole National Park on Thursday. 

ADVERTISEMENTThe incident came to light when Forest Department personnel were on a patrol. Forest officials said the animals may have died after consuming water mixed with urea from a pond adjoining the plantation. While a few animals were found dead inside the plantation, a few were found in a nearby farm. Plantation owners usually mix water with urea for several reasons, including poaching, to avoid animals from drinking scarce water and also to use it as fertilizer.

Veterinarian Dr Umas­hankar conducted the autopsy and collected samples to be sent to the forensic lab for further investigation. The veterinarian said wild goats visit nearby villages to consume neem seeds and they might have died after consuming water mixed with urea. 

Umashankar also said forest department personnel found urea near the pound, which is poisonous for animals. However, the reason for the death will be ascertained after forensic reports are obtained, he added.

Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF) Belliyappa said there is no water problem in the forest, but a few animals depend on the pond for drinking water. The DCF said initially no cases will be registered against farm owners. “We will take necessary action based on the reports from the forensic lab,” Belliyappa added.

Conservator of Forests S Manikandan and Range Forest Officers Madhu, Sharanabasappa and Vivek visited the spot. A case has been registered.
