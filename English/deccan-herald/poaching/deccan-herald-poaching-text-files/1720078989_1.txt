New Delhi: Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha Saturday launched a blistering attack on RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, saying he can never get rid of 'the taint of corruption' however much he tries.ADVERTISEMENTIn an interview with PTI, he also alleged there was 'Jangal Raj' in Bihar when the RJD was at the helm.Replying to questions, he said the RJD may have been promoting Tejashwi Yadav, its Leader of Opposition in Assembly, as the 'future of the state', but people will reject 'dynastic politics and nepotism' and choose the one who works in their interest.Sinha categorically rejected the RJD's allegation the Modi government has been misusing central probe agencies to poach opposition leaders facing corruption charges and that when they join the BJP their 'stains' gets cleaned in the saffron party's 'washing machine. "Lalu Prasad had also tried. He became chief minister (of Bihar) for the first time with the help of the BJP. But, the BJP never put him in its washing machine," the Deputy Bihar chief minister said."The taint of corruption on him can never be washed off, no matter how much he tries," Sinha said. "The BJP always gives opportunity to people but never to those who are tainted, corrupt and create feelings of hatred in society. Such people cannot stay in the BJP ever." 	Sinha said the BJP-led NDA has once again started a move to free Bihar of 'goonda raj' and corruption and to provide good governance and promote a society where there is no division on the basis of caste.Also Read:Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughters likely to enter Bihar Lok Sabha poll fray as RJD candidatesAlso Read:Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughters likely to enter Bihar Lok Sabha poll fray as RJD candidates"The people of Bihar are confident that it will be achieved under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," he said.
