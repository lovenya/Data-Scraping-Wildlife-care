As cliched as it may sound when one says ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’, the fruit has its benefits. Not everyone is a fan of eating the fruit as it is, so here are a few recipes you can use the humble fruit in.ADVERTISEMENTChicken Apple SaladIngredients* Shredded boneless chicken breast, 1
* Finely diced apple, 1/2 cup
* Mayonnaise, 1/2 cup
* Finely diced onions, 1
* Lemon juice, 1 tsp
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Sliced bread
* Softened butter, 2 tbspMethod* If the chicken breast is not already cooked and shredded, finish that process first by adding it to boiling water and poaching it for 10 minutes on medium heat. Cool it down completely before use.
* In a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, including the chicken.
* Butter the bread and spread the mix on one slice.
* Shape the sandwich however you like. You can consume it immediately or place it on a baking sheet with a damp cloth and cover it tightly with a plastic wrap for 24 hours before serving.Spinach Salad with ApplesIngredients* Apple cider vinegar, 2 tbsp
* Olive oil, 3 tbsp
* Dijon mustard, 1 tsp
