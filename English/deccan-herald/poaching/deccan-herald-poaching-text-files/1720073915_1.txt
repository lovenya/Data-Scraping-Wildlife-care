Troubles are not yet over for actor Salman Khan who is facing charges of poaching endangered species with illegal arms while shooting for the film “Hum Saath Saath Hain” in the year 1998 in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan. 

ADVERTISEMENTHe is being tried in two cases under Wild Life Act and Arms Act while appeal in two other cases against his conviction is lying pending in Jodhpur bench of Rajasthan HC.

A week before, Salman had appeared before the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) in Jodhur to record his statements in the two cases against him. The final arguments in the two cases had been completed on February 10 but the court deferred the judgment as hearing on four old applications in the case were found pending. In the previous hearing on April 29, Salman’s lawyer requested the court that the actor wants to produce six more witnesses in his defence. Accepting the request, CJM Anupama Bijlani deferred the hearing till May 14. The actor has claimed that he was framed by forest officials.

The two cases under trial are related to poaching of blackbuck in Jodhpur district in 1998. The Forest Department also filed a separate case under the Arms Act, accusing Khan of using unlicensed revolver (S&W .32 bore) and a rife (.22 bore) during hunting. According to legal experts, Salman is facing charges under section 3/25 and 27 of Arms act, which has the provision of 1-7 years of imprisonment.

In February 2006, Salman was convicted for poaching two chinkaras at Bhawad. In the first case he was given one-year jail and fined Rs 5,000. Three month later, he was convicted in the second case with five year jail. The actor could not get immediate bail and had to spend 3 days in Jodhpur Jail. In 2007, he was again behind the bars and his appeal against conviction was rejected by an upper court. Later Rajasthan High Court accepted the appeal and granted him bail.
