With a video showing a BJP leader allegedly trying to poach an AAP legislator, the Congress Monday urged the Supreme Court to take cognizance of the matter and order fresh polls in Delhi.

ADVERTISEMENT"The matter is with the Supreme Court and it has asked the (central) government to submit a reply whether it is going for fresh election or asking any party to form a government in Delhi," Congress leader Ajay Maken told the media.

"If BJP says that they are ready to form the government then the court should take cognizance of BJP trying to purchase MLAs (of other parties)... The court should order for holding a fresh election in Delhi," Maken said.
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Monday released a video, which showed some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders allegedly offering a plum post and money 

"In the video, Sher Singh Dagar is talking to someone senior on phone, we want to know who that person in high command is," Maken said.

Meanwhile, another Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit criticised the AAP for trying to influence Congress MLAs.
"The BJP has been exposed but I want to question the AAP members why are they after Congress MLAs? They were on their knees in front of the Congress legislators a few days back. Arvind Kejriwal is now desperate to come to power," Dikshit told a news channel.

Delhi has been under President's rule since Kejriwal resigned as chief minister Feb 14 after just 49 days in office.
