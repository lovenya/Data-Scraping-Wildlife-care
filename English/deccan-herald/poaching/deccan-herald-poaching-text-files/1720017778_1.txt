A prosecution witness today identified actresses Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu in the 16-year-old black buck poaching case which allegedly took place in Kankani village near here.

ADVERTISEMENTApart from the trio, Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan are also accused in the poaching case of two black bucks, which allegedly took place on the intervening night of October 1-2, 1998.

Assistant Public Prosecutor Praveen Verma said witness Sheraram identified the actresses in the court, adding he had been living close to the spot, where the poaching took place.

"Sheraram, who was sleeping on the roof of his house, came down and followed the vehicle being driven by Salman Khan with a neighbour Mangilal on hearing the noise of the neighbours and gun shots," said Verma.

According to Verma, Sheraram deposed before the court that when the vehicle took a turn and came back towards him, he tried to stop it but it did not.

"He told the court that it was then when he saw Salman Khan driving the vehicle with Saif Ali Khan sitting in the front seat and the three actresses sitting behind with them," said Verma.

The cross examination of the witness by the counsels of the three actresses was completed today.

Chief Judicial Magistrate (rural) Anupama Bijlanai ordered that the hearing will continue tomorrow. Another witness Mangilal would also appear tomorrow. He had accompanied Sheraram in chasing the vehicle.

Sonali and Tabu had appeared earlier in the court in February last year for the identification by first prosecution witness Poonaram.

But he did not recognise any of them then. So far 10 prosecution witnesses have been produced in the court for cross examination in relation to the poaching of the two black bucks.
