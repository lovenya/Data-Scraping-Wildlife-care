The JD(S) on Sunday asked its legislators not to fall prey to the poaching operation by principal Opposition BJP whose leaders had been predicting collapse of coalition government in the state after the Lok Sabha elections.ADVERTISEMENTChief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, who chaired the JD(S) legislature party meeting, is learnt to have assured that the coalition government will be stable even after the parliamentary elections. “The saffron party may try to lure JD(S) MLAs in coming days. Stay united and don’t get carried away with false promises of the BJP,” he is learnt to have said in the meeting.The JD(S) legislature party meeting was held in the wake of rebel Congress MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi threatening to resign along with some of his MLA friends. Not only the BJP, the JD(S) is said to be worried about eerie silence being maintained by some senior Congress leader despite the threat of rebellion posed by Ramesh.Besides, Kumaraswamy discussed the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections in the State and collected information on likely prospects of the coalition candidates during the meeting.JD(S) national president H D Deve Gowda called upon the legislators to work towards strengthening the party. Educate people on pro-people measures taken by the Kumaraswamy government, especially loan waiver, he said.
