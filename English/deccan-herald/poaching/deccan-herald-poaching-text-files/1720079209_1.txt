But he lost the election.  After his meeting with Shivakumar, Manjunath said his close association with Yediyurappa would continue irrespective of the party he was in.“I come from a Sangh Parivar background. But due to political compulsions, I quit BJP to join JD(S). Now, I plan to leave JD(S) and join Congress. I tried my best to join Congress ahead of the polls, but could not due to technical issues. I will soon join Congress,” he told reporters.“Everyone is concerned about their future in politics. We have the numbers on our side, we don’t need to poach anyone. But if someone wants to join us, how can we say no?” Shivakumar said, speaking to reporters.Reacting to Manjunath’s plans to join Congress, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy said, “How can anyone stop people who have already decided to leave?”.
