A pilotless aircraft will keep vigil on the Kaziranga National Park where animals are in disarray after a large part of the world famous sanctuary was flooded, and also to help deal with poaching.

ADVERTISEMENTNational Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) Secretary Rajesh Gopal said on Tuesday that the step had been taken after a team of the authority, which would fund the project, conducted an aerial survey last week and found that the situation was critical as almost the  entire park flooded.

“We hope that this use of a pilotless aircraft will help tackle both flooding and poaching in and around the World Heritage Site Park,” Gopal added.
