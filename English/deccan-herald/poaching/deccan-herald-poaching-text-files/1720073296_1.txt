Zurich: As Credit Suisse fades into history following its takeover by UBS last year, global banks are expanding in Switzerland to take advantage of companies' desire to spread their business.ADVERTISEMENTFrance's BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and US lenders Citi and Bank of America are among those increasing staffing and courting smaller companies that form the bedrock of the Swiss economy."When one player is absorbed, the musical chairs are being rearranged and that creates opportunities," said Enna Pariset, who heads BNP's Swiss operations.

"Corporates are seeking new banking partners and are expected to fill this gap within the next 12 to 18 months," she said.Mainly serving firms with sales upwards of 200 million francs, BNP has risen to become number two in the Swiss franc-denominated bond market, and wants to move into share buybacks, said country head Pariset.BNP saw opportunities among smaller exporters, Pariset added, noting it had hired some 50 staff in corporate and investment banking since 2022 - about a dozen of them from Credit Suisse.($1 = 0.8935 Swiss francs)
