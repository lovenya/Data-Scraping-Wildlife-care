Congress party. If the BJP tries to wean even a single MLA away from us, we will surely get their MLAs into our party,” he said.Patil further said, such statements make sense when the ruling party is having a wafer thin majority in the Assembly, which is not the case at present.The people of Karnataka have given a decisive mandate of 136 seats. So, it’s not easy to topple the government here, he added.
