Thirty? Forty? How many would you guess there are?With new species being added to their lists every few days, scientists find estimating the number of animals and birds on our planet a difficult task. While their records currently have over a million species of animals identified, they believe that there could be several million more, out there, just waiting to be discovered.

The graceful eland, the speckled owls, the reclusive turtles, the prickly porcupines — Kingdom Animalia is Mother Nature’s crowning glory.

Can you name an animal that could rival the enormity of the mighty elephant? If you are smart, you’d probably say, ‘The blue whale’, and you’d be right. But elephants are the largest living land creatures today. They are classified under three species: Asian Elephants, African Bush Elephants, and African Forest Elephants. Until the last Ice Age, however, there were very many more, with the woolly mammoth and the mastodon being the best known. Do you know the difference between a mastodon and a mammoth? Whereas both animals were furry (hence the term woolly), and had rather impressive tusks, the resemblance is superficial.

Woolly mammoths came into existence 4.8 million years ago. It’s a common but erroneous belief that they were giants in comparison with present day elephants; indeed, the word mammoth is now used to mean gigantic. In reality, mammoths were only a bit bigger than the average elephant (elephants are usually 10-13 feet tall at the shoulders, which would make them slightly taller that your school’s basketball post).ADVERTISEMENTMammoth had tusks that were greatly curved. Mastodon tusks, in contrast, jutted out horizontally, sometimes for over 5 metres forwards! Female mastodons had a lower pair of tusks too, something that males grew out of when they reached adulthood. 
Mammoths were grazers and fed largely upon grass and low vegetation. Mastodons were browsers, preferring woody twigs and tree leaves.

Mastodons derive their name from the Greek term meaning ‘nipple tooth’. This refers to the projections on the crowns of their molars. Mastodons are thought to have been hunted for food by early human settlers in North America, but palaeontologists believe that tuberculosis played a larger role in their extinction.

Long ago, there were other unusual species of elephants, too; the dwarf elephants among others. These were no bigger than a large pig when fully grown. Dwarf mammoths and pygmy mammoths were the last to fall into extinction. Dwarf mammoths survived on Russia’s Wrangel Island and pygmy mammoths on the Channel Islands of California until as recently as 2000 BC! 

The sea cow and the hyrax are also thought to be distantly linked to the elephant family. 
Fortunately, both species have escaped the fate of their distant relatives. According to the World Resources Institute, a hundred species of life become extinct every few days. 

With illegal poaching for tusks and human encroachments upon their territories, elephants face extinction, themselves. It is up to you, dear reader, to spread awareness about concerns for our living environment, for only we have the power to stop this from happening.
