The party on Sunday shepherded all its MLAs from Eagleton Resort in Bidadi to Golden Palms in Hesaraghatta.

The sources in the party said the elected representatives would stay in the resort for next two to three days or till the Karnataka High Court pronounces the verdict on the disqualification of five Independent MLAs. The case is scheduled to be heard on Monday.

It is said JD(S) has become extremely cautious after losing Ashwatha. Any reduction in its strength would only help the ruling BJP. The party for now is sure that the disqualified MLAs are with it. Chances of them going back to the BJP can’t be ruled out if they turn ‘qualified’ by the court verdict and keeping them together has become a great task for JD(S) state chief Kumaraswamy, it is learnt.

‘Convincing’ Congress

Rumours were rife that the JD(S) was in the attempt to ‘convince’ Congress to lend its total support in toppling the government. Kumaraswamy was closeted with Congress leaders Siddaramaiah and Ibrahim. On Saturday, Siddaramaiah discussed the prevailing political turmoil with Union Law Minister Veerappa Moily in Bangalore. A section of the Congress MLAs who lent support to JD(S) and ‘let down’ by the high command are now trying to send a message to the Delhi that they would not like to be taken for granted.  

The Congress has instructed all its legislators to be in Bangalore on Monday. They are likely to be shifted to a resort again after the legislature party meeting.ADVERTISEMENT
