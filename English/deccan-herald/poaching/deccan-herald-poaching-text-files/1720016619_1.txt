A day after a Sri Lankan court ordered their release, 34 Tamil Nadu fishermen, who were taken into custody by the Island Navy for trespassing into their waters, arrived here tonight.

ADVERTISEMENTThe fishermen along with their five boats were earlier handed over to the Indian Coast Guard at the International Maritime Boundary Line by the Lankan Navy, officials said.
After India lodged a protest against detention of its fishermen, a court in the island nation had yesterday ordered their release.

The fishermen from Thangachimadam here, part of a group which had ventured into the sea, were arrested on March 14 on the charge of trespassing and poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
