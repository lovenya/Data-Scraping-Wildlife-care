“Permission for relocating two more tigers and two tigresses has just been accorded,” Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh said here on Friday. Since 2003 Madhya Pradesh received warnings from scientists, non-governmental organisations and the central empowered committee of the Supreme Court on the declining tiger count. But the state government ignored those warnings and did not work on suggestions for the betterment of the park as a result of which rampant poaching took place between 2003 and 2009.

Few months ago, a Special Investigating Team under the National Tiger Conservation Authority officially declared that Panna reserve does not have any more adult tiger left embarrassing the MP government. Buoyed by the success of the Sariska experiment — where three big cats were relocated after the park was found devoid of tigers — the Centre permitted translocating two tigresses in Panna. 

In March Panna received two tigresses from Kanha and Bandhavgarh forests. In addition, the Centre has now given permission for relocating two more tigresses and two tigers.
Ramesh has appealed to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to fix accountability of erring officials and improve the security net for the park. 

“Lack of accountability (on the part of the state officials) was the biggest reason behind Panna debacle. The state constantly denied existence of all threats,” the minister said.
The Centre will soon sign tripartite memorandum of understanding with the states and 37 Project Tiger parks for better management of the forests.ADVERTISEMENT
