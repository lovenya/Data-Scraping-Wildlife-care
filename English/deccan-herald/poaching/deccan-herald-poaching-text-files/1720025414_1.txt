The BJP is delaying the announcement of its candidates for the remaining 70 seats for the Assembly polls as it is hoping to poach winnable leaders from other parties.ADVERTISEMENT“The party is ready with a list of candidates for the remaining 70 seats. However, the party has withheld the list as it is expecting some strong leaders from the Congress to join the BJP,” sources in the party said.“We are in talks with some disgruntled leaders from other parties, mainly the Congress. By  Friday, we will get a clear picture whether leaders from other parties will join the party or not,” the source said, adding that the final list may be released by Friday.Since there are weak candidates in some seats, the BJP is negotiating with leaders from other parties and has promised them tickets, said a leader. The BJP is also working on whom to field in case Chief Minister Siddaramaiah contests from Badami in Bagalkot.
