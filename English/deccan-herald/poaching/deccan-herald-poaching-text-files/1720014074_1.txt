ADVERTISEMENTThe editor, Sunil K Poolani, has done well by collecting this interesting blend of perspectives, from the many authors who now dot the Indian writing horizon. 

Each piece of writing follows a line of thought that is both original and imaginative and all the featured authors need to be commended for their brilliant contributions.This anthology is unusual in that it features essays, fictional pieces, translations, as well as poetry. Whilst some of the writers come from a journalistic background, all of them are well-known names in contemporary Indian writing. Word constraints limit the scope of this review, which may not be able to focus on all the writers’ writings. 

Whilst Ramachandra Guha tries to give a name to the Maoists and suggests that “social banditry” is what they indulge in, Shashi Warrier speaks of a friendship that develops between him and a boy from Madhya Pradesh whose family has been affected by the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. It is pathetic to hear what the father of an afflicted girl says… “He prays that if anything like this happens in future, some big people must lose what we have lost…”  

Kalpish Ratna, the duo comprising Kalpana Swaminathan and Ishrat Syed write on a burning issue that environmentalists are shouting themselves hoarse about — the illegal poaching of sand by the sand mafia, in this case, from the coastline of Bombay. This essay effectively reveals the fall-out from the “ecological assaults on the coast”, including a dreaded disease like cholera.   

Priya Sarukkai Chabria uses the imagery of the abhisarika nayika, an icon of love in ancient Sanskrit poetry, to understand “The Centrality of Wander in Creative Space,” the title of her essay. Chabria’s style is both lyrical and intellectual, as she suggests that “we consistently live with simultaneous and multiple inconsistencies and hypocrisy.” 

“Gone Away” by Kankana Basu touches on the plight of old parents, abandoned by NRI children, who have made a life for themselves in another part of the world. It also traces the plight of children who walk the tightrope in offering care to their old parents, even as they hold down demanding jobs and other responsibilities in India. 

The essay highlights the disturbing trend of parent-child estrangement that occurs when “thousands of graduates leave for foreign lands in search of greener pastures.” For some years, these parents are perhaps indulged with a yearly vacation to the foreign land but all this stops, as the “daunting prospect of footing medical bills,” becomes a reason to dissuade them from further visits. Basu’s essay poignantly reveals the tragedy of children standing “poised to inherit every asset garnered by their parents over a lifetime, while parents stand doomed to an inheritance of loss”.  
 
The short story, “Freedom” by Shreekumar Varma, eloquently brings out the sense of betrayal that culminates in violence and a jail term for a young man. The story unfolds in a perfect understanding of how an idol can have clay feet. “Many great men succumb to ordinariness once their provocations are done, when they reach an age that doesn’t support their rage.” But even harder to understand is one’s idol “playing the role of a hero to earn his keep”.   

Anjana Basu’s “Lives of the Wise” is a brilliant piece, delving into the lives of those who earn fame and recognition with their involvement in the arts. Basu speaks of the aura around an art creator whose success “implies a superior kind of grey matter” which has always garnered respect in a country like India. 

Anjana takes an incisive look at the power, money and recognition that comes to such a person, and uses Arundhati Roy as one example, as also the budhijibis (wise ones) whom Mamata Banerjee used as her advisors after their support of the Nandigram agitation. The piece clearly warns of the danger of getting too carried away with one’s talent and being sucked into the system that one has become famous criticising! 

“The Ugly Indian Middle-Class” by Aakar Patel brings out what is lacking in India’s middle class society. He critiques the middle-class tendency to “think and approach life in a foreign language, one they have not mastered.” He also places India’s inability to produce good literature behind the fact that the Indian middle-class does not own a language properly. 

Manu Joseph’s “Bullshit as a Cultural Force” is a subversive but nail-on-the head piece about what ails India and the propensity of Indian citizens to permit themselves to be taken for a ride.

While the pieces selected in this compilation are a class apart, they could have benefited from tighter editing. For instance, it is unforgivable to pass off something as relevant as an SEZ to be expanded as Social Economic Zones. This apart, the book is a must-read for anybody who wants to have a deeper insight and understanding of urban India.
