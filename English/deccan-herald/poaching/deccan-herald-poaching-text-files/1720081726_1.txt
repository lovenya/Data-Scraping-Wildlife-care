Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday alleged that the BJP was trying to poach newly-elected AAP councillors and asserted that none of them will fall prey to their "game".ADVERTISEMENTHe said the newly elected councillors have been instructed to record "such phone calls" in case they receive one.Sisodia's allegations come after the Aam Aadmi Party won the MCD polls with 134 seats, ending the 15-year rule of the BJP in the prestigious municipal corporation and reducing the Congress to just nine seats in a house of 250.The BJP, which was predicted to suffer a massive defeat in exit polls, put up a spirited fight, winning 104 municipal wards.Read | MCD polls: AAP candidates record biggest, narrowest victory margins"BJP's game has begun.
