The navy Saturday arrested 26 Indian fishermen who were in Sri Lankan waters, a navy spokesman said. ADVERTISEMENTThe navy said that the Indians were on five trawlers when they were detected and arrested for entering Sri Lankans waters illegally. Navy spokesman Kosala Warnakulasuriya told Xinhua that the Indian fishermen were to be brought to Kayts islands in the north. Fishermen from both countries often stray into each other's territory as both countries are divided by a small strip of sea. 

Last month, Colombo released a group of Indian fishermen who were arrested for poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
