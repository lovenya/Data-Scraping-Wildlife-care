Aiming for stricter enforcement of laws to protect wildlife, the Centre on Monday introduced a bill in Rajya Sabha having provision of imprisonment up to seven years for poaching or hunting of wild animals. The Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2013, introduced by Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan, seeks to further amend the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

ADVERTISEMENTThe bill provides the legal framework for the protection of various species of wild animals, management of their habitat and also for the regulation and control of trade in the products derived from them.

The bill seeks to confer power of entry, search, arrest and detention on any officer authorised by the Management Authority or any customs officer not below the rank of an inspector or any officer of the coast guard not below the rank of an Assistant Commandant.

The bill seeks to deal with the serious of wildlife crime such as the offence related to any animal specified in Schedule I or Part II of Schedule II or the meat of such animal or animal article, trophy, or uncured trophy derived from such animal. 

If a crime of this sort is committed, the bill seeks to punish the culprits with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years, but may extend to seven years and also with fine which shall not be less than Rs 1 lakh but may extend to Rs 25 lakh.

In the case of a second or subsequent offence of the same nature, the terms of imprisonment shall not be less than seven years and also with fine which shall not be less than Rs 5 lakh but may extend to Rs 50 lakh. 

The bill proposes to insert new definitions in view of the amendments proposed in the Act.
