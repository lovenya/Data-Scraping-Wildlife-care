He also denied speculation about him having joined other disgruntled MLAs in Mumbai. About half-a-dozen disgruntled legislators, including former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, are said to be holed up in Mumbai. The BJP is hoping they will resign in the coming days.Siddaramaiah is learnt to have advised Patil not to fall prey to any poaching attempt by the BJP. “Don’t end up spoiling your political future,” a source quoted Siddaramaiah as having told Patil.The cop-turned-actor-turned-politician has not attended the ongoing budget session so far. He even skipped Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy’s budget presentation on Friday. “Kumaraswamy has neglected my district. I’m not happy with the budget,” Patil told reporters. “But I didn’t go to Mumbai to meet disgruntled MLAs. I met Siddaramaiah to express my disappointment. It is because I’m disappointed that I’ve not attended the budget session,” he said.
