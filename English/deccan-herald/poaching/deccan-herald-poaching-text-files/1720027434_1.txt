Wildlife activists have expressed concerns over 750 tiger deaths between 2012 and 2019 and supported stricter wildlife provisions to punish the guilty.“It is a matter of grave concern that tigers in such a large numbers have died due to poaching and other reasons. There is a need for stricter penal provisions for those found guilty of wildlife crimes,” said Bhopal-based wildlife activist Ajay Dubey.He said conservation efforts need to be expedited to save the big cats from poachers.“Much attention is paid on tiger tourism by state governments concerned which is affecting their natural habitat. There is a need to speed up the efforts to conserve tiger. Government must make harsher punishment for wildlife related crimes,” Dubey said.Echoing his views, Simrat Sandhu, member of Rajasthan wildlife board, said conviction rate for wildlife crimes is quite low.“There has to be a provision of life imprisonment at least for grave wildlife related crimes like poaching of tigers. Also, the state governments must take the case of missing tigers seriously and trace them so that poaching of these big cats can be avoided,” Sandhu said.
