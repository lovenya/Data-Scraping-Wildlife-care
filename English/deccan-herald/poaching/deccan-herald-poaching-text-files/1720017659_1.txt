The Delhi state unit of the BJP has called an urgent meeting here Tuesday afternoon, a day after a video alleging poaching of an AAP MLA by the party vice president surfaced, sources said.

ADVERTISEMENTThe meeting would be presided over by the party's Delhi unit president Satish Upadhyay, who would first meet the office bearers at around 3 p.m. followed by discussions with the district presidents around 5 p.m., a source said.

"The leaders will take stock of the situation," said the source, adding that the leaders will discuss ways to not let the video damage its prospects in case Delhi goes to polls soon.

A covertly shot video released by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Monday showed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit vice president Sher Singh Dagar making the bribe offer to AAP MLA Dinesh Mohaniya whose resignation would have brought down the effective strength of the hung Delhi assembly.

Dagar made an angry rebuttal to the disclosure but the party distanced itself from the incident. The BJP has sought an explanation from him while one leader advised him to resign from his post until proven innocent.

The BJP now has 28 members in the 70-seat Delhi legislature after three of its MLAs got elected to the Lok Sabha. The AAP has 27 members and the Congress only eight. There are four other members in the house.

Delhi has been under president's rule after Kejriwal quit as chief minister in February this year.
