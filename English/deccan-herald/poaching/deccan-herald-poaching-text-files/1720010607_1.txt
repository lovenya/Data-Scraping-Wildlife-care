The experiment that will provide some vital information about the behavioural pattern and other allied habits of the creature is intended to find out and analyse reasons behind occasional straying of the big cats into the neighbouring fringes of the mangrove forest, a senior forest department official said. The seven-year-old tigress, which had entered Satjelia village under the Gosaba block of the Sundarbans delta a few days ago, was trapped on July 2. The sensitive microchip, fixed on an ear of tigress, will be monitored remotely. 

“The movement of the tigress will be studied which will give us a sort of warning before its straying,” he pointed out. 

DNA test

The forest department has also ordered DNA test of another trapped tiger, he informed. The DNA test is to study the difference of the species from those in other parts of India and the world.

“The test will enable us to have a genetic mapping of tigers in the Sunderbans. Once we get the test results, it will be used to compare the features of the Royal Bengal Tiger with those in other parts of the globe,” the official explained.

India has half of the world’s surviving tigers, but conservationists say the country is losing the battle to save the big cats. There were about 40,000 tigers in India a century ago, but decades of poaching have slashed their numbers to about 3,700, according to a count conducted in 2001 and 2002. This count slipped further in recent times as experts have apprehended that the original count might reveal a far less number than what is being projected.
