Taking a dig at the coalition government, BJP leader R Ashoka on Thursday claimed that the Congress would soon sever ties with the JD(S).ADVERTISEMENTAshoka also said that the BJP had no need to engage in Operation Lotus (poaching of MLAs) as the government was busy “digging its own grave.”‘Cong to divorce JD(S)’“The Congress is all set to divorce the JD(S) - it is going to say talaq, talaq, talaq. I’m sure the ‘soda cheeti’ (divorce) will soon go Kumaraswamy’s way. This government will not last very long. The Congress has no intentions of going ahead with the Cabinet expansion on December 22. The party is going to put it off again,” the BJP leader said.
