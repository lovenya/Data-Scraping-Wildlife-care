Conservation of these species is very important as they play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of the Western Ghats,” said conservation biologist Dr Sachin Punekar.He has played a vital role in setting up the orchidarium and training frontline staff of the forest department in collecting orchids that fall off trees.In a unique collaboration, forest guards and deputy range forest officers were trained in identifying and sustainably collecting and transplanting wild orchids.KTR field director Maria Christu Raj said, with the financial assistance of Kaiga Nuclear Power Plant Corporation, and funds from KTR Foundation, the department is transforming an old nursery into an orchidarium.The orchidarium will serve two main purposes; one ex-situ conservation of orchids found in the landscape in a scientific manner and two, reintroducing them in the forest and also as part of eco-tourism, where the public will be informed about the importance of orchids.“A small nursery is also planned where the public can buy some generic orchids which are widely distributed,” he said.They are working on the interpretation framework to present these orchids.Castlerock deputy RFO Parasappa Jajappagol said within 45 days after being trained by Punekar, they started identifying 42 species of orchids in their ranges and started collecting fallen orchids.They later planted them within their anti-poaching camp. “A majority of the collected orchids have started flowering and fruiting now,” he said.
