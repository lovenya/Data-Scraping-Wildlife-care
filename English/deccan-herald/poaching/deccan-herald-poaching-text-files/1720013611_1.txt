Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, Moily termed Operation Lotus as “open call for defection” and accused the BJP of murdering the democracy through poaching. 

“Its a black spot on politics. All attempts are being made to subvert the law and the BJP will be in trouble if it continues the operation,” he said.

Refusing to comment on the Karnataka High Court verdict upholding the Speaker’s decision to disqualify the rebel legislators, Moily said the MLAs, if unhappy with the judgement, can appeal in the Supreme Court. He attributed the political chaos in the State to the ‘vertical split’ in the BJP owing to differences between the national and state functionaries.

Gram Nyayalaya

Moily said the Union Law Ministry was committed to bring in a revolution in the justice delivery system through Gram Nyayalayas (rural courts). “Civil and criminal cases should be disposed of within six months through rural courts. Two such courts have been set up in Chikkaballapur. The government has been neglecting to establish rural courts across the State,” he said.

 The Minister revealed that funds have been earmarked under the 13th Finance Commission for appointment of 15,000 judges.
