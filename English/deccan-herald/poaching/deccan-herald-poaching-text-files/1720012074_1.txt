The task force, which was also headed by Khanna, had proposed integrated solution to incorporate modern technology for enhancing conservation efficiency, he said. The task force has proposed to use GPS-based system for surveillance tracking, animal tracking and also tracking of vehicles coming inside the Gir Sanctuary.

It is envisaged that all field level subordinates (foresters), supervisory staff and senior officers would be equipped with hand-held devices capable of voice, data and geo-coordinate transmission. Such devices would be networked to a central server.

Regarding animal surveillance through GPS tracking, the task force has proposed that approximately 10 per cent of the lion population covering its entire geographical spread should be fitted with GPS collars capable of transmission of signals.ADVERTISEMENT
