The Aam Aadmi Party will dispatch the CD of the sting video allegedly showing a BJP attempt to poach a party MLA to President Pranab Mukherjee and launch a campaign to expose the saffron party, said AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday, launching a fresh salvo a day after going public with the sting.

ADVERTISEMENT“If the BJP tries to form a government, we will make more disclosures at an appropriate time,” said Kejriwal, alleging that the saffron party was in touch with 15 AAP MLAs to explore the possibility of government formation in the national capital.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted the Centre time till October 10 to respond to Aam Aadmi Party’s petition challenging President’s rule in Delhi.

But the court refused to consider an affidavit submitted by the party on the sting released on Monday, which implicated Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sher Singh Dagar for trying to bribe a party legislator to resign from his position.

‘FIR against BJP’

The party said it will file an FIR against the BJP leader and meet the Delhi Police Commissioner. AAP has also hit out at the Delhi Lieutenant Najeeb Jung, accusing him of ‘batting’ for BJP.

“The LG has made it clear that he wants the BJP to form its government. He even went ahead and mentioned how much time he intends to give BJP to prove its majority in the House,” the party said, while referring to the Jung’s September 4 letter to the President on the possibility of having a ‘popular government’ before recommending dissolution of Delhi Assembly.

The party said it will urge the President not to pay heed to the LG’s advice of inviting BJP to form a government. 

“We will also make an appeal to the LG and ask him to revise the letter, and tell the President that he should not invite BJP to form the government in Delhi,” the AAP chief said.
