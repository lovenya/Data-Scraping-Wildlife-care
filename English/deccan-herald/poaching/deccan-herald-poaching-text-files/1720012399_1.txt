Big cats of Bandipur Tiger Reserve can now prowl about in peace.  The Karnataka government has decided to speed up its 2008 plans to set up a unique task force to protect tigers of the reserve. 

But before that, they got an earful from New Delhi-based National Tiger Conservation (NCTA) and even Union Minister for Environment, Jairam Ramesh, for the deaths of eight tigers since 2009 in the reserve. Four of these deaths occurred since January this year.

In a letter to the State government, the NCTA threatened to cut funding for the tiger reserves in Karnataka if they did not take steps to care for the big cats. The State has been directed to review the monitoring and security of the tiger reserves. Such a letter was also sent to other states that had tiger reserves.  Top forest officials, however, denied getting any such letter. 

Nevertheless, the State government is moving fast to set up the Special Tiger Protection Force  (STPF) by 2011 and plans to set aside Rs 4 crore for it. To be formed as per NCTA guidelines, it will be the first of its kind in South India.

The STPF will be entrusted with keeping a watch on tigers within the State as well as monitor the porous borders of Karnataka adjoining Kerala, where poaching has been reported of late. 

The squad will be headed by an assistant conservator of forests and will comprise three range forest officers, 18 foresters and 90 guards, who will be divided into three groups. Each group will be provided a vehicle, arms and other equipment by the NTCA. Even the salary and other perks of the task force will be per the NTCA. 

The recruitment process for the STPF would begin from June 13, B K Singh, Principal Chief Conservator and Chief Wildlife Warden, told Deccan Herald.  “Those selected after examinations will undergo six months’ rigorous training at Yelahanka Police Training centre,” he said. It will also have a member from NCTA.
