A group of fishermen from Sri Lanka and India clashed in Sri Lankan waters early Sunday, a navy spokesman said.ADVERTISEMENTThe clash occurred along the international maritime boundary which divides both countries in the northwestern seas of Mannar, said Sri Lankan navy spokesman Kosala Warnakulasuriya.Warnakulasuriya told Xinhua that they had received information about the clash and had sent a navy boat to make inquiries and defuse the situation.Several clashes between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen have been reported, with Colombo accusing Indian fishermen of poaching by crossing into their territory near Katchatheevu, known for its rich fish wealth.Katchatheevu is an islet ceded by India to Sri Lanka in 1974.

Due to the increasing number of incidents, India and Sri Lanka are close to clinching an agreement on drawing a fishing boundary in the Palk Strait that would put an end to recurring attacks.
