Inspired by reality shows, young children are taking over the kitchen and cooking up a storm. Kanchana Banerjee thinks it’s a trend that needs to be encouraged

Where have you kept the basil?” Ayan calls out to his mother. “I need to sprinkle it on the tomato gravy that I’ll roll the chicken in.” Ayan’s mom is one lucky mother who has a son who helps her in the kitchen. Big deal, do I hear you say? Please stand corrected. For, it’s not mere ‘helping in the kitchen’ that Ayan does. He takes over the kitchen every Friday night, and often on weekends too to make breakfast and lunch. He whips up the most amazing chicken in tomato puree with lemon zest! Yes the boy knows what lemon zest is and how to scrape a lemon rind without getting it bitter. And, oh! Did I mention...Ayan just turned 14 last month? And his best dish is beef steak with mushroom sauce. Simply wowlicious!

Rohan makes the most perfect scrambled eggs you’ve ever had. Yes. They are almost five-star-hotel quality. To get it right, you need just the right amount of milk, and the eggs have to be beaten to a frothy consistency. The most difficult part? Controlling the heat so that scrambled doesn’t become desi egg bhurji! He also makes amazing pepper chicken with capsicum and has been driving his mother mad to help him make a caramel pudding. Rohan turns 14 in July this year.  

Surbhi (12) simply loves to make different types of kebabs. Her mother, Anita, says, “She has always been very keen on helping me in the kitchen. I love cooking and so does she. She loves making Moglai and Tandori dishes.” Her kebabs are succulent and will melt in your mouth.

Welcome to the brave new world of little chefs. Kids who just can’t be kept out of the kitchen — this time, not to grab a bite but to whip up a meal. And we aren’t talking about omelettes or two-minute Maggi. These are young boys and girls ranging between 10 and 15 years of age, who can cook up whole meals, and sumptuous ones at that. 

Kaveri, Rohan’s mother says, “It began with Masterchef Australia. I love cooking and followed Masterchef avidly and surprisingly, so did my son. He got hooked onto the show from the last season and this year, he told me he wanted to cook!” Kuhu, Ayan’s mother adds, “He always liked to potter around in the kitchen but now he is serious about cooking. I find recipes for him from the Net and come Friday night, Ayan dons the chef’s hat and gets busy in the kitchen.”

Both mothers say in unison that while their respective sons cook, they insist on being at home to supervise the basic prep like chopping, mincing and cutting. This is because they don’t want to leave the boys unsupervised when they handle knives. But the actual cooking, the boys do on their own while the moms chill in front of the TV or with a book!
That Masterchef Australia had a huge fan following in India is a known fact. Men, women and children sat glued to their TV sets as 12 contestants battled to win. But even the organisers wouldn’t have bargained  that the show would inspire young boys and girls to actually start cooking. 

The children got to see and learn various cooking techniques, ingredients and recipes presented beautifully on the show. Rohan says, “I learnt the difference between poaching and boiling. I saw how macaroons were made, understood how a pasta maker operates, and learnt about different types of cheese.” So, what is it about cooking that he likes so much? “I think it’s so creative. You have the raw ingredients and you put them all together to make a beautiful dish that others can relish. I like that.” Ayan adds, “My mom always downloads a lot of recipes from the Net and cooks interesting stuff. I like that.” Ayan stores his recipes in a folder called ‘Food Yeah!!” in his computer.

Surbhi says, “I just experiment with different kinds of meat and marinades. Sometimes after I’ve made something that everyone liked, I am unable to repeat the same recipe as I had made it all up. Then I feel really sad that I couldn’t remember what I had put in the marinade.” I took a leaf out of the recipe book (in her mind): A marinade of curds and lots of whole pepper roughly crushed, a dash of garlic mince and salt. Soak the chicken in this overnight and you’ll have the most tender and yummy chicken kebabs you’ve ever tasted.

Anjali Vellody is an artist who is starting a cookery class for kids in a posh suburb of Mumbai. “I’ve been running an art class for kids and my love affair with food isn’t new.” Author of over 20 cookery books, numerous cookery articles and columns, Anjali found that numerous kids in her art class were very enthusiastic about joining a cookery class when she mentioned it. “Children as young as eight and nine responded enthusiastically.” She plans to teach interesting recipes, both traditionally Indian as well as international, in her cookery workshop.

She adds, “I conceived the idea of a cookery class for kids with a different purpose. I firmly believe that children should be made self reliant in today’s world. As they grow older they may have to live and study in a different country, or work somewhere across the globe, where they would have to fend for themselves. In such a scenario knowing how to cook can come in handy. Also, it inculcates good eating habits. A person who knows how to cook will be less likely to reach out for junk food!” Starting off with this thought, she was prepared to debate, discuss and convince mothers on why such a workshop would be such a value add. “But I didn’t have to explain anything to anybody. Kids today are eager to learn cooking!”  

An article in a leading newspaper reported that in Japan mothers are eagerly introducing their kids, as young as six and seven, to the kitchen. According to the article, when Etsuko Mizukoshi, a researcher of cooking for children, explained Chinese-style rice with red beans and salad-stuffed cabbage rolls to 11 second-graders, the kids got hold of their favourite knives after adjusting their chairs to the height of the cooking tables. The mothers later confided in the researcher that the kids who worked in the kitchen became better eaters. “Once they saw how much time and effort it took to cook a meal, especially if they had prepared it themselves, they didn’t fuss about it!!”

So if you have a fussy eater who pushes his or her food around the plate and drives you crazy, then get him or her to join you in the kitchen. And don’t be surprised if you don’t have to coax them at all. For, the kitchen, that has for long been mama’s bastion, is now being enthusiastically breached by her children!
