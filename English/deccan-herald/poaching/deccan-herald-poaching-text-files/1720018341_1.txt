A day after a tape surfaced in which Arvind Kejriwal is purportedly talking of poaching on Congress MLAs to form government in Delhi, another audio tape emerged today in which he allegedly talks of Muslims having no option other than AAP to stop the Narendra Modi wave.

ADVERTISEMENTIn the audio--recorded before Delhi assembly polls--Kejriwal is heard as having said that Muslims don't expect AAP to field many candidates from their community but wants the party to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"If the party thinks that we field 11 Muslim candidates, then forget it.  The question is not that AAP is giving 11 seats to people from the Muslim community. Muslims are looking at us in a way that if anyone can stop the Modi rath, then it is only Aam Aadmi Party.

"This is the hope that Muslims have from us. They don’t have any hope that more Muslim candidates will be fielded. Do a survey of 2000, 3000 and 5000 people. Do a survey of Muslims. What is the priority?

"Today, no one is able to stop the Modi rath in the country. They are forming governments in states one after the other. Today, Muslims are looking at us...if anyone can stop the Modi rath. Congress is over. It has given up. It is not contesting polls. They are asking us to field 11 seats," Kejriwal is heard saying in the tape believed to have been released by a dissident AAP leader.

In a tape that had surfaced yesterday, Kejriwal is purpotedly heard as talking of poaching six Congress MLAs to form government in Delhi last year.
