In a first of its kind operation, 19 endangered sloth bears, rescued from their lives as ‘dancing’ bears, underwent dental surgeries to remove tumors caused by broken teeth.

The bears were rescued by Delhi-based NGO Wildlife SOS which has been working to end the brutal practice of dancing bears across India. 

The bears underwent the three-hour-long surgery at the NGO’s bear rescue facility in Agra. The bears were poached from the wild as cubs and abused by captors. When rescued, their teeth were found to be in bad shape due to abuse. 

In the century-old practice by the ‘Kalandar’ community, a cub of a sloth bear is captured, its muzzle pierced with a hot iron rod to make a hole to put a rope inside it, and make it perform on the streets to earn money. 

When the ‘master’ pulls the rope, the bear jumps out of pain and fear and people enjoy watching it ‘dance’. This gives the animals the name — ‘dancing’ bears. 

The bears were treated by veterinarians from Wildlife SOS with support and guidance from a team of four veterinary dentists from the United Kingdom. 

“The health of these bears was severely compromised as dental infection had set in. This poisons the blood stream with bacteria causing significant amount of pain and severe discomfort to the bear. Veterinary dentistry is a specialisation that’s badly needed in India, with a handful of specialists working in this area,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS. 

“The bears are showing good signs of recovery after the successful surgeries. I anticipate that the bears should recover from the treatment in the next two weeks, during which time the diet will be fed soft mashed fruits, with supplements and painkillers. We can already see a considerable positive change in the bears. The dental treatment has brought significant improvement in their overall health,” said  Arun A Sha, Wildlife SOS veterinary director.
