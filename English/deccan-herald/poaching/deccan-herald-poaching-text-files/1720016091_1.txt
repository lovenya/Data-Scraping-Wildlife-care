Two elephants and a wild boar were found electrocuted in the cashew jungle along the Lambei-Karadabani border in Odisha's Ganjam district.

ADVERTISEMENTThe carcasses were recovered yesterday. The age of the female elephant was about 30 years, while the calf was about one year old, forest officials said. 

The wild animals were electrocuted after they got entangled in the live electric wires apparently laid by poachers inside the jungle, divisional forest officer, Ghumusar (North) K Ch Mishra said.

Forest personnel also seized the electric wires from the spot. The poachers were suspected to have laid the wires to kill small animals like wild boar and deer, the DFO said.

It was the second such incident in Ganjam district in last ten days, where at least three elephants were found dead due to electrocution. A tusker was electrocuted after it came in contact with the live wires laid by poachers at Karchuli jungle under Buguda forest range on September 26 last.

The poachers had looted a portion of its tusk, which was recovered by the forest officials later.

Mishra said the elephants were suspected to have come in contact with wires on Friday night, while a herd of animal were moving from Jagannath Prasad to Gallery forest area.

ForestÂ officials said no one was arrested in the latest incident. They had arrested one of the four persons, allegedly involved in poaching the tusker at Karchuli jungle on September 26. The accused person was identified as Lambodar Nayak of Samalei village for killing the elephant, sources said.
