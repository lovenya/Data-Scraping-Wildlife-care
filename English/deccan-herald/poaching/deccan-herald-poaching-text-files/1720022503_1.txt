Seats reserved for women in BMTC buses will soon turn pink to deter male passengers from occupying them. The government took the decision  following complaints from women,  Transport Minister H M Revanna said on Tuesday.  ADVERTISEMENT"Men occupying women's seats has led to quarrels. We think seats of a  different colour will send out a message and deter men," he added.To begin with, women's seats in the new  BMTC buses that are yet to be delivered will be painted pink.  "The remaining buses will have their seats changed when they go for repair. This will be extended to the KSRTC and other corporations in the coming days," the minister said.This apart, the BMTC and the BBMP have come together to open a health clinic each  at Yashwantpur and Kempegowda (Majestic) bus stations at a cost of Rs 15 lakh each. The BMTC will provide land and the BBMP will be responsible for infrastructure and equipment. "The clinic will cater to the  public as well as BMTC employees. Services will begin on December 2," Revanna said.Indira Sarige and Indira PassThe minister said a committee comprising the heads of finance, labour and transport departments as well as the managing directors of KSRTC and BMTC was looking into a proposal to provide bus passes to women construction workers.
