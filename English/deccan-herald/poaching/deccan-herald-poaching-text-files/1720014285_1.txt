According to the recommendation, “E-8 countries will lead the effort in respective regions to bring together the regional range states to embark upon collaborative efforts on elephant conservation, management and welfare by sharing knowledge, information, experience, skills and resources to eradicate poaching, smuggling, and illegal trade of elephant ivory and other parts, and derivatives, and control wildlife crime within our own countries and in the region.”

Long-term programmes

It is said the countries would pursue and encourage long-term national and global programmes and actions to create awareness of the value of elephants and their habitats, and also share knowledge and experiences to reduce and mitigate human-elephant conflict.

“We would engage with indigenous peoples, local communities and other stakeholders to secure their support and participation in scientific conservation and management of elephants and their habitats,” the recommendation said.

The recommendation said the countries would encourage use of the indigenous knowledge as well as improved scientific management incorporating the application of modern and innovative tools, standards, and technologies in monitoring elephants and their habitats.

To achieve these goals, the E-8 countries decided to actively pursue a common agenda to ensure long-term welfare and survival of all species of elephants in all range countries.

The countries also decided to “call upon all range countries to join hands under the umbrella of ‘Elephant-50:50 Forum’ or the shared vision of 50 states to promote conservation, management and welfare of elephants in the next 50 years.”ADVERTISEMENT
