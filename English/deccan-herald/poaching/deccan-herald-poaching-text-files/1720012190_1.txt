"We recovered the carcass Sunday evening from Phandanasi area along the Chilika coast. A fishing hook used could have led to its death as the carcass had a hook in it," District Forest Officer Bimal Acharya said.
According to wildlife officials, this is the sixth dolphin that has died in the last one year. Five have died in Parikud and Kalijai areas of the lake, which is Asia's largest brackish water lagoon. Chilika is home to 146 Irrawaddy dolphins.

"We have two squads to keep a tab on poaching. Most of the deaths have been reported in Kalijai area," Acharya added.
Wildlife officials have sent the carcass for post mortem examination Monday to determine the cause of death.
