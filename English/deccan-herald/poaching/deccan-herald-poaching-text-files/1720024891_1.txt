The famous British character was a farmer named Roger Godberd, according to a retired lecturer of the University of Leicester, the Daily Express reports. David Baldwin, 64, said he has managed to "unmask" the outlaw after decades of research.

His book - "Robin Hood: The English Outlaw Unmasked" - reveals how Godberd was finally pardoned and died at his farm in the 1290s. Godberd had led a band of men who robbed travellers. He was even captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham, he said.

The outlaw was also accused of poaching deer in Sherwood Forest along with his companion Walter Devyas - believed to be the "Little John" of the popular legend.

"There are probably several outlaws whose deeds have contributed to the modern-day legends of Robin Hood. But I believe there is one man whose career underpins the stories," said Baldwin.ADVERTISEMENT
