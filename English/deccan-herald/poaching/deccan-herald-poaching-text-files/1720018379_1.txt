Premier League strugglers Queens Park Rangers splashed out on strikers Bobby Zamora and Djibril Cisse on deadline day, while there was a flurry of action at Tottenham Hotspur and in Italy, but generally the January transfer window ended up a damp squib. 

ADVERTISEMENTZamora signed from Fulham and Cisse from Lazio as England again outshone the rest of Europe in terms of spending, even if there was nothing remotely as big as last year's late Fernando Torres and Andy Carroll drama. 

Premier League high-fliers Spurs, always busy on deadline day, surprisingly took injury-prone Louis Saha from Everton and let fellow striker Roman Pavlyuchenko talk to Lokomotiv Moscow. 

Qatari-backed French league leaders Paris St Germain continued their spending from August with the purchase of Thiago Motta from Inter Milan, who let Sulley Muntari join rivals AC Milan on loan amid other deals at Claudio Ranieriâ€™s side. Global economic woes may have been a factor in the slowdown this January, especially in Spain where many cash-strapped clubs have barely made any signings in the window, but experts doubt it had a major impact on the Premier League. 

Premier League title contenders Manchester City drafted in David Pizarro from AS Roma on loan but Carlos Tevez, the most talked about man in the window having burned his bridges at City, ended up going nowhere and remains an outcast. 

In Germany, Hoffenheim signed Wolfsburg striker Srdjan Lakic on loan until the end of the season.
