Detailing preparations of the party in the meeting, Kashyap said that the party is poised to win as many as 40 seats in the 68-member Assembly. On the other hand, within the Congress the rebel problem was meant to cause least headache, with there being as many as 10 rebels of the party contesting the polls, there is now a bigger headache in front of them — the spectre of poaching. Sources said that senior party leaders, including General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, were keeping a tight eye on the situation, in a bid to stop the party’s MLAs from being poached. Exit polls have predicted a close fight in the hill state, which traditionally alternates between parties. While India Today-My Axis predicted the Congress’s win with 30-40 seats as opposed to BJP’s 28-33, News24-Today’s Chanakya predicted a hung assembly giving both Congress and BJP 33 (+/-7) seats. To win the state, either party has to win as much as 35 seats.
