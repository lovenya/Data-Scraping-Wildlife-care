But that has not fizzled out the veteran actress’ passion for films. After a long time, Zeenat is making a comeback on the big screen with Sunjay Sharma’s Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyun. Zeenie plays the role of Rebecca, a beautiful and charming lady who is in her late 40s. 

To make it more interesting, Rebecca sure knows how to play her cards well in order to cater to the needs of her family, for whom she can do anything. 

Rebecca also works hard to remain in shape because she fears that the day she loses her charm, the men who are crazy about her will be gone too.

Knowing that the role demands a glamourous persona, and also that all eyes would be on her as she makes a comeback, Zeenie made sure that she looks every inch the diva that she is. 

According to sources, “She worked on her body for three months before commencing the shoot. So it was yoga, workout regimens and a strict diet that she stuck to for the desired result.” 

“An example of her seriousness is the fact that on the day of her look test, Zeenie didn’t eat a morsel.” 

“Only after completing the entire day’s shoot did she have steamed idli.”
What's more! All the clothes that were stitched for her before the shoot had become too big for her after just two schedules. 

During the gap between the schedules, which spanned a few months, she lost 12 kgs. So the makers had to stitch a few new dresses for her.  But no one was complaining as they could experiment with her clothes and even make her wear short skirts with leggings! So everyone can look forward to a younger and more gorgeous Zeenat when she appears on the screen after all these years.The ‘Idiots’ reunite  The standard edition DVD and VCD of 3 Idiots was launched recently. The launch function, hosted by Reliance Big Home video at a popular hotel, turned out to be an interactive and lively session with stars Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Sharman Joshi and director Raju Hirani being welcomed by Reliance BIG Home Video. 

Sweta Agnihotri, chief operating officer, declared that the 3 Idiots premium DVD has become the fastest selling DVD in Indian history. 

Aamir quipped, “It is a film which I’d like to keep with us after we watch it in the theatre as well as on TV once. Even today, Mukesh Ambani told me that he watches the DVD of 3 Idiots everyday.” 

“All my films are close to my heart and I make it a point to keep the clapboard after the last scene is shot of each of my films. If only Vidhu Vinod was here today, I am 100 per cent sure that he would have been on the 9’o clock news tonight,” he adds.
Raju emphatically declared that he had absolutely no plans of making a sequel to 3 Idiots. 

Aamir said that he is emotional about all his films and would like to keep even the film in which he has given his worst performance ever. Aamir startled the audience by confessing that he does not have the scientific mind of Rancho since he is not comfortable in real life with any electronic item. 

He even said that he faces problems operating simple items like the air conditioner and seeks the help of his kids to run them at home.  Enough of experimentingLooks like Yash Raj Films has learnt a few hard lessons in the past few years. After the debacle of many of their recent films, Yash Raj Films is keen to have more hits in its kitty. Many films made by the production house, like Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Tara Rum Pum, Aaja Nachle, Laaga Chunri Mein Daag, Pyaar Impossible, Lafangey Parindey, failed to set the cash registers ringing. Net result? Yash Raj Films is bent on changing its policy. So debutant directors will not be a part of any of their projects in 2011.A Tamil film on SalmanSalman Khan’s fan following in the South is so strong that a Tamil film producer is making a film on the star. B R Krishnan of B R K Films is apparently making a film on the life of Salman. Tentatively titled Anna Salman or Brother Salman, the film is inspired by the 
ups-and-downs in the life of Salman Khan, including his relationships and love life. 

Mumbai-based actress and model Ritu Sachdeva, who has done lead roles in South films like the recently-released Kannada film Srimoksha, has been signed on to play the main lead. 

Says producer B R Krishnan, “I am still looking for a hero to play Salman’s role. The film is not based on Sallu bhai’s life, it is only vaguely inspired by it.” Ritu, who herself is a great fan of Salman Khan, was earlier seen in singer Alka Yagnik’s music videos — Chahat and Rahbar, which were released in July by Venus Music. 

The film will include incidents like the Bandra Bakery accident and the black buck poaching case. However, the hero is shown as a good character, who ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time and messes up his life. The hero also has a torrid relationship with a young actress (played by Ritu Sachdeva) — an apparent reference to Salman Khan’s troubled relationship with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.
