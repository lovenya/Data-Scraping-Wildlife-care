The BJP campaign managers had offered huge sums of money to persuade several Congress candidates to withdraw their nomination papers. Several party candidates in Tumkur and Bangalore urban districts have been offered up to Rs 50 lakh each to withdraw from the fray. 

Parameshwara alleged that the ruling party is tampering with the voters’ list in places where the Congress party is strong. Names of a large number of voters have been deleted in such places, depriving people of their voting rights. 

Although the party has lodged many complaints with the State Election Commission in this regard, no action had been taken.The Congress leader, however, expressed confidence that his party would win maximum number of seats in the polls. “People across the State are talking about rampant corruption in the Government,” he stated.

Power for polls
Parameshwara further alleged that the Government is supplying 24/7 power only to districts that are going to polls in the second phase. People who have voted in the first phase of the elections, are already facing the problem of power cuts. “The Government is waiting for the elections to get over so that it can impose power cuts all over the State,” he said.
