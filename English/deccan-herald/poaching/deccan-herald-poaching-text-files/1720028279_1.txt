Agriculture Minister N H Shivashankar Reddy said on Wednesday that H D Kumaraswamy was Chief Minister for all in the coalition government.ADVERTISEMENT“A few Congress legislators may have termed Siddaramaiah as their Chief Minister even today due to pride for him. These are purely individual opinions. In the coalition government, Kumaraswamy is Chief Minister for all,” he told reporters.“The Congress legislators wanted Siddaramaiah to be the Chief Minister before the Assembly election last year. However, the Congress party did not get absolute majority due to various reasons. Hence, the High Command directed Siddaramaiah to volunteer for the formation of the coalition government,” Reddy said.He said that BJP’s attempts to poach MLAs wouldn’t succeed. Congress and JD(S) were capable to finding solution to the problems of the coalition set up.
