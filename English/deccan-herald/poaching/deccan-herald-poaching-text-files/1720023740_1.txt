Actor Salman Khan will have to spend at least another night in Jodhpur's Central Jail after a Sessions Court adjourned a hearing on his bail plea in the blackbuck poaching case till Saturday.ADVERTISEMENTDistrict and Sessions Court Judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi heard arguments on the suspension of sentence and bail application before deferring the matter till Saturday. Salman's sisters Alvira and Arpita were present in the court.  Moreover, the court heard the defence counsel's arguments and the prosecution will present their arguments on Saturday.In his arguments, defence counsel Mahesh Bora said there were various loopholes in the investigation. He argued that no probe in any of the cases of poaching proved that Salman used firearms."The court has asked us to present records on Saturday. After hearing the public prosecutor's arguments, it will deliver its order on the actor's bail plea. We are ready with a 51-page bail plea, which raises 54 grounds on which the superstar can be granted bail", Mahesh Bora, the actor's counsel for the sessions court, told DH.  Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Joshi also sought a record of the case from the lower court."We have argued that the eyewitness in the case was not reliable," Bora added.A trial court in Jodhpur on Thursday convicted Salman in the two-decade-old blackbuck poaching case and sent him to five years in prison.
