Soon after the trial court sentenced Salman Khan to five years in jail in the blackbuck poaching case, the actor was shifted to the Central Jail in Jodhpur.ADVERTISEMENTThe barrack that was allotted to Salman was next to that of self-styled godman Asaram Bapu, who is housed in the same jail after his conviction in a rape case.The actor was brought to jail in a white police van, which was stopped midway at the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital for his medical examination. 

Speaking to DH, Jodhpur Central Jail Superintendent Vikram Singh said, "No special arrangements have been made for the actor. We have allotted him a barrack that was cleaned on Wednesday. It's adjacent to Asaram's barrack".The actor's lawyer will apply for bail on Friday, and till it is granted to him, the 52-year-old superstar will have to stay in a barrack that has neither air conditioner or cooler. The actor will be using a common toilet, which according to the jailer, is "clean enough".When asked about the internal security in the jail, as it houses a few aides of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi who had threatened to harm Salman, Singh said, "We will provide him extra security inside the jail in case it is needed".Same jailIn August 2007, Salman Khan had spent a week in the same jail after the Rajasthan High Court sentenced him to five years in prison under the Arms Act, which was suspended a week later on his appeal.Apart from Bapu, the Jodhpur Central Jail houses former MLA Mahipal Maderna, convict in the Bhanwari Devi sex scandal, and Shambulal Regar, infamous for the murder of Muslim labourer Afrazul which he had video-recorded. The central jail was recently in the news for a major security breach after Regar posted hate videos online from the jail premises.
