He cut a huge cake brought by some of his supporters to mark the celebrations.  

Later speaking to reporters, he criticised the BJP for poaching MLAs of the Opposition parties by offering huge amount of money in the name of ‘Operation Lotus’. The BJP is setting the bad precedent which will be detrimental to democracy, he added.

Bangarappa said there is a need for making certain amendments in the anti-defection law in the wake of some MLAs switching loyalty by resigning from their posts. 

The law is being misused by the BJP to remain in power. Appropriate amendments should be made to the law to ensure that nobody misuses it, he added.ADVERTISEMENT
