Here is some good news for those who want to enjoy wilderness on a trek. For, the first phase of the much awaited Great Canara trails will be thrown open for trekking from August, post monsoons. 

The Forest and Tourism departments along with Jungle Lodges and Resorts will open the 108-km trekking route from Ulvi to Castle Rock (near Dudhsagar waterfalls). 

Kali Tiger Reserve (KTR) Director Srinivasulu Krishnamurthy told Deccan Herald that this 108-km-stretch is just one part of the 270-km long Great Canara trails from Jog Falls to Castle Rock. 

The first league is being opened from August and the second one will be launched later. KTR and other forest patches already have small trek routes. All these will be made a part of the Great Canara trails. 

Srinivasalu said the aim of trekking is to make people aware of forest and conservation as a whole and not limit it to tigers. 

The brochures of the trek routes are getting ready and will soon be made public. While trek routes have been identified, resting and amenity sites will be in make-shift tents.   

The route lists 24 places, which includes Ulvi temple, Anshi Green Camp, Samanth Mathkarni anti-poaching camp, Madhumale village, Munne cross, Karwar-Joida road, Siddeshwara temple, Shridi village, Panasgali anti-poaching camp, Kali river bank, Kindala anti-poaching camp, Tadki anti-poaching camp, Vajra falls and Kungini anti-poaching camp. 

The trekking terrains are mixed: easy, mid segment and difficult. It covers water holes, rocky terrains and plain lands. Trained guides will be accompanying trekkers all through the routes. 

Based on the carrying capacity study conducted by the Forest department, the number of people per segment per day is restricted to 30. 

This is being done to restrict crowding. The 108 kms can be covered in 10-12 days and on an average a person could cover 12-14 kms a day. The whole 270-km trek will be of 20-24 days duration.
