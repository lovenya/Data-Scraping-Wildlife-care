This only shows that the charges levelled by the Delhi chief minister and his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders were 'completely baseless', Sachdeva said.Kejriwal and other AAP leaders last week claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was trying to poach MLAs of the ruling party in Delhi by offering them money and election tickets.Also Read:Kejriwal joins I.N.D.I.A partners in slamming Nitish for switch to NDAAlso Read:Kejriwal joins I.N.D.I.A partners in slamming Nitish for switch to NDAKejriwal had charged that seven AAP MLAs were contacted and offered Rs 25 crore each to defect. He had also alleged that a conspiracy was being hatched to arrest him in the alleged liquor scam and topple his government in Delhi."It is an old habit of Kejriwal to level allegations against BJP leaders and then apologise. But this time we have decided to take action against him," Sachdeva said. In their complaint submitted to the police commissioner, the Delhi BJP delegation also sought action against Kejriwal and other AAP leaders, including minister Atishi, and MLAs Dilip Pandey and Durgesh Pathak.Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the BJP MLAs will also raise the issue in the Budget Session of the Assembly in February.
