"The tigers are doing pretty well and we hope that they will soon go the family way. The project signifies our commitment towards wildlife conservation including tiger preservation which is enlisted as endangered species and tops the chart of the ecology system," Ramesh added.

SAARC countries like Bhutan, China and Bangladesh have tigers in the wild but the count is too low when compared to India which has around 1,400 big cats in the forests.

China is already facing flak for continuing with tiger-farming to meet the local demand for tiger parts, one of the main reasons for poaching of big cats in the wild.
Re-introduction of tigers in Sariska was aimed at reviving the big cat population in the region which lost all of them by 2005 to poachers and man-animal conflict.
Two more tigers are planned to be relocated in the coming months to the Sariska reserve spread over around 800 sq km.ADVERTISEMENT
