A section of students in Patna have appealed to Anand to release the names of all those 30 students whom he had been grooming for the JEE-2011  before the result is declared in May.

Bring transparency in work by releasing  the names, addresses and photographs of all  students in advance “so that no one can  charge you with manipulation”, said the students of Bal Adalat organised by Students Oxygen Movement, a Patna-based NGO . 

Ever since Super 30 was formed in 2002, it has helped 212 poor students clear the IIT-JEE in the last eight years. For the last three years, all the 30 students of the institute have made it to the IITs, drawing worldwide attention.

But, of late, some coaching institutes have questioned the authenticity of Anand’s claim. 
 “All this is a ploy to defame me by one person who was earlier associated with this initiative,” Anand said.

“Once in 2007, I had released the names in advance. But then, some of my students were kidnapped, others were offered laptops and asked to name coaching institutes other than Super 30. So its my personal experience that if I make the names of my students public, the coaching people will indulge in all sorts of poaching,” argued Anand. He, however, asked this correspondent to come over to his institute four hours before the IIT result is out.
