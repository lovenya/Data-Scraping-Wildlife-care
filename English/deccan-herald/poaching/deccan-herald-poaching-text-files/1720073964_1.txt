I can say this with guarantee," he said.The BJP leader alleged that the Siddaramaiah-led previous Congress government in the State had withdrawn 175 cases and had released 1,600 people who were Popular Front of India (PFI) and Karnataka Forum for Dignity (KFD) activists, involved in anti-national activities and had taken law and order into their hands."This was with an intention to create division in the society. There is vote bank politics and politics of convenience behind this," he said, as he charged Siddaramaiah with conspiring to disturb peace in the State. "Siddaramaiah is squarely responsible for it," he added.Also questioning the rationale behind Siddaramaiah government's move to close Lokayukta by making it weak, Nadda said it was because the Congress government deeply indulged in corruption, and were "part and parcel of commission and corruption"."Division of the people, division of society, corruption, incompetence, non-governance, divide-and-rule, all these are the basic traits of the Congress, I'm saying this with responsibility and am ready to substantiate," he said, as he urged people to support the "double engine" government to take Karnataka forward.BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, national general secretaries C T Ravi and Arun Singh, Union Minister Shobha Karandlaje were among others present at these events.Later in the evening, Nadda addressed the arecanut growers convention in Chikkamagaluru, where he listed out various farmer-friendly initiatives taken by the Centre and those by the state government.He said, whatever good has been done for the benefit of the arecanut growers in the country, it has been done only by the "double engine" BJP governments at state and Centre, he said.Nadda is scheduled to visit Sharadamba Temple in Sringeri established by Hindu scholar Adi Shankaracharya and offer prayers there later tonight.
