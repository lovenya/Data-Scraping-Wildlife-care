Chilika lake in Odisha, one of the topmost winter homes of migratory birds from across the globe, has already recorded arrival of first batch of the winged visitors. The inflow of the avian guests is expected to increase in the next few weeks.

ADVERTISEMENTThe authorities in charge of the picturesque water body, considered to be the biggest brackish water lagoon in Asia, have already initiated steps to provide birds a safe and peaceful stay.

“Despite Phailin and Hud Hud, lakhs of migratory birds had thronged into lake to have their annual sojourn last year as well as the year before. The weather conditions have remained fine now. Therefore, we expect congregation of large number of birds this year too. We are ready to play host to our winged guests,” said an official in the State Forest and Environment Department which looks after the maintenance of the lagoon.

While tropical cyclonic storm Phailin had severely affected three Odisha districts of Ganjam, Khurda and Puri that house the Chilika lake, Hud Hud had partly affected these districts as the storm had its landfall in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.

With the arrival of migratory birds, the threat of poaching has also gone up. Chilika was once known as a poachers’ paradise. However, the killing of innocent birds have come down considerably in the last few years because of the pro-active role of the authorities.

But it has not stopped completely. To keep a tight vigil on the poachers and their activities, the forest department has already set up as many as 19 camps in and around the lake. Adequate personnel and a speed boat have been provided to each of the camps.

Besides, a mobile squad has also been placed into service to coordinate the anti-poaching operations. Nearly 160 species of birds congregate in the Odisha lake every winter.
