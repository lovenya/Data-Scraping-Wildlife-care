These hills don’t see ample rainfall with monsoons draining most of its rain over the lofty mountains in the west. 

The hills are thus bedecked not with evergreen rain forests but with dry deciduous jungles, grasslands with intermittent patches of sholas which are quite suitable for most of the fauna. The varieties of tree and plant species are also diverse enough with some rare and endemic ones. As the Ghats of the west and east merge in the south eastern part of the state, a rich wildlife corridor has taken shape naturally.  

Second largest elephant corridor

The BRT wildlife sanctuary sits snugly in this landscape of rolling grassy hills and shrub land and is the home of the wild, particularly the elephant. The sanctuary, named after the temple of Biligiri Ranganathaswamy on the highest point, is said to be the second largest corridor for elephants with the movement of over 1,000 elephants through it. This was reason enough for poachers led by forest brigand Veerappan to make hay by killing the pachyderms mercilessly for their valuable tusks till recent years. 

The decline of tuskers set an imbalance in the male–female ratio thereby jeopardising their survival. Gladly now it is a thing of the past and the elephants seem to have earned a respite. Incidentally, the forests have also become a rather safe destination for those who wish to wander in them be it for research, relaxation or adventure. For the trekkers though, the Forest Department has devised the specific trekking routes that go by the name of Mystery Trails . 

Our team of four embarked on a trekking outing along the Jodigere–Bylore route that traversed the Punjur and Kollegal ranges. This route, involving a trek of  about 22 kms in two days, is not only rated as a difficult one but offers a good chance of sighting wild elephants.  We drove off from Mysore to Chamarajanagar to get the necessary permission from the forest  officers and proceeded to the Punjur range office. 

As we bought ration and sundries and boarded an afternoon bus for Bedaguli, a forest guard and a Soliga tribesman joined us. Another positive attribute of the Mystery trails idea is that these Soligas who represent the Eco-Development Committee of the area tend to get monetary benefits from trekkers. On the way, we had a glimpse of the Doddahalla waterfalls, also known as Srinivas Falls after the late DFO, P Srinivas, who was slain by Veerappan. 

Jodigere or twin tanks

Bedaguli is a tiny hamlet on the fringes of the forest with a few huts. From here began our journey on foot rather late in the evening. The route is a jeep track that gains altitude gradually. Then, there are open areas interspersed with stunted shola patches. 

While the walk itself was enjoyable, it soon became dark and windy. Before reaching  the Jodigere Anti-Poaching Camp (APC) in fading light, we took a look at the Sharavana Betta hill as Konnur, our Soliga guide narrated its legend. Long ago, a demon called Sharavana lived on this hill and was a terror to all the people in the vicinity. To save the people, Lord Madheshwara appeared here, killed the demon and threw his body on another hill before proceeding to Male Mahadeshwara hill.

The Jodigere APC is a strongly built concrete tower with a couple of rooms to stay. Though the day’s task looked arduous because of 13 kms, a couple of Gaurs (Indian bison) grazing on distant slopes stirred our senses. Initially, the path went up a moderate hill to reach two tanks. 

That is why this place is called Jodigere meaning twin tanks. The prominent landmark here is the cairn that marks the boundary between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  As we were about to step ahead, the guide alerted us to the presence of elephants. We froze and watched excitedly as four of them with a baby in between slipped into the shola hardly a hundred metres away. We gave them sufficient time to move away. Thrilled by the sight, we resumed the brisk walk to come to an edge with a deep chasm right below. 

The valley with a rich spread of bushy jungles and hills in the horizon crowned with a line of clouds was breathtaking! From here on, it was an endless descent as the guide cleared the path ahead for us. We were duly treated to a generous share of the leech bites on the damp floor of the jungle.

By the end of the walk, we were at Bylore APC with no soul around. Having come down by 4,000 ft we  rested a while and took the easy stretch of a few kms more to catch a bus back. 

Getting there 

Chamarajanagar is 185 kms from Bangalore via Mysore along SH 17. It can also be reached via Kanakapura & Kollegal. Permission from the Forest Department at Chamarajanagar is required.ADVERTISEMENT
