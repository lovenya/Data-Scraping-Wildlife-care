Illiteracy is the main cause for the rise in child marriages and sexual atrocities, opined Kripa Amar Alva, chairperson, State Child Protection Commission.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing media persons in the town recently, Kripa said, the campaign ‘Shaale Kade Namma Nade’ had been launched by the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently, to protect child rights.

“The campaign will end on June 10. Its objective is to identify children who have been denied education and admit them to schools. I am touring the state in this regard and have visited eight districts so far,” Kripa said.

Social evils like child marriage, child labour, sexual atrocities against children, and female foeticide are due to illiteracy. The need of the hour is to create awareness among illiterate parents, she stressed.

If education is denied to children between six and 10 years, it is like snatching their rights. Hence, minor changes have been effected by the commission and a statewide campaign is being conducted to provide education to children between three to 18 years. The campaign concentrates on identifying school dropouts and admitting them to schools again.

Kripa said, “According to 2011 census, for every 1,000 boys there are only 911 girls. The ratio was 1000:924 in the census conducted in 2001.”

About 23,000 children in the age group of six to 14 years are out of school. As per the data available, there are 193 school dropouts in the district for the year 2016-17. The Education department has been advised to take measures to attract the students, she added. Child Protection Commission member Chandrashekar and others were present.
