After a brief argument with the driver, she and Sohan got out of the cab. While deboarding the cab, Agrawal slammed the door shut. The driver became angry and picked a fight with her. He then hit her in the face and also beat up Sohan when he tried to save his mother, a police officer who's part of the investigation said. Hearing Agrawal's screams for help, apartment residents rushed to her rescue but the cabbie drove off by then. Acting on a complaint filed by Agrawal, Bellandur police tracked down the cab driver, who has been identified as Basavaraju Ramappa, 25. He is a native of Shantigere village, Gajendragad taluk, Gadag district, and lives in Malleswaram. "Regardless of why the fight happened, the cab driver made a mistake by assaulting the woman," the officer said. Baavaraju was booked for wrongful restraint, voluntarily causing hurt and international insult with intent to breach of peace.
