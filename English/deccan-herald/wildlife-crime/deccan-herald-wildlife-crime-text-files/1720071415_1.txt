Anna Roberts, executive director of the Burma Campaign UK, said it was a way of keeping up economic pressure."The EU must now also look at creative ways to stop oil and gas revenue reaching the military. It is vital to continue to systematically identify and cut sources of revenue to the military," she added.The London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which probes transnational wildlife crime, illegal logging and deforestation, also applauded the move."There is now no legal source for timber, including precious teak, to be imported from Myanmar into the EU," said EIA forests campaign leader Faith Doherty."With these targeted sanctions, we will be able to stop the flow of hard currency to those who profit individually."
