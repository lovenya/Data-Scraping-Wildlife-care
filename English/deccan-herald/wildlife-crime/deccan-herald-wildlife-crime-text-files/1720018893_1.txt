During the investigation, it was also observed that some real diamonds were imported but replaced with synthetic diamonds and smuggled outside the SEZ, it said. Investigations also indicated that the inflow of money into importing entity's bank account took place through bank transactions by various dummy firms in India and then the said money was transferred (laundered) from this single bank account to overseas suppliers in Hong Kong; under the pretext of payment towards import of 'diamonds'. The gathered evidence also indicates that the mastermind of this trade-based money laundering was based in Hong Kong, it added. Further investigations resulted in the arrest of four persons in India under the provisions of the Section 104 of the Customs Act, 1962. The Indian Customs issued Show Cause Notice (SCN) for seized goods, wherein Hong Kong-based entities were also made notices, who, however, refused to respond and present themselves in front of Indian Customs, it added.
