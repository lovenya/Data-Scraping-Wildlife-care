Crime against women has shot up by 17 % in the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh.
 
The revelation was made by the UP Women's Commission in reply to a query filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
 
In reply to the query filed by RTI activist Sanjay Sharma, the panel furnished the statistics pertaining to the complaint received by it as well as their disposal during the Mayawati regime from 2007 to 2012 and also during the Akhilesh Yadav government from 2012 to March 2017.
 
It said that over 97 thousand complaints had been received by the Commission from May 13, 2007, to March 14, 2012 (Mayawati government). All the complaints had been disposed of by the Commission, the RTI reply revealed.
 
In reply to another question, the Panel said that around 1.80 lakh complaints had been received from March 15, 2012, to March 18, 2017 (Akhilesh Yadav government). Around 1.63 lakh complaints were disposed of by the Commission.
 
In the first three months of the BJP rule, over 10 thousand complaints were received by the Commission of which only 2800 were disposed of, the RTI revealed. ''It means only 27 % complaints were disposed of by the Commission,'' Sharma said.
 
The figures also show that crime against the women has registered an increase of 17 % in comparison to the Akhilesh Yadav government, he said. The average month's complaints stood at 2996 under Akhilesh but under Yogi Adityanath the number has shot up to 3506, he added.
 
''The Commission's reply clearly proves that the BJP government has failed to ensure the safety of the women...the chief minister should take the figures seriously and start taking corrective measures,'' he said.
 
The Adityanath government has come under attack over alleged deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
