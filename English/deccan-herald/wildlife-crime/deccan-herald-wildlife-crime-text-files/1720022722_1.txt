A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped by her neighbour in Jharkhand's Palamu district, police said on Saturday.ADVERTISEMENTThe incident happened on Tuesday, but the complaint was filed on Saturday as the local panchayat was allegedly preventing the woman and her husband from going to the police station because the accused is the brother-in-law of the 'mukhiya' or village head, they said.The accused, a 36-year-old man, took the woman's husband to a programme on Tuesday night and returned to the village a while later alone, leaving him there. On returning to the village, he went to the woman's house, gagged her and took her to an isolated place, where he allegedly raped her, police said.Also Read | 10-year-old boy killed in maoist-planted IED explosion in JharkhandIn the meantime, the husband returned, and not finding his wife at home, he started searching for her.
