The Centre has come up with a guide for parents on how to raise their children in order to prevent them from committing any crime.ADVERTISEMENTThe guide, titled—'Raising Happy Children and Providing Safe Childhood'—also seeks to offer tips to teachers and community members on how to prevent crime and violence by juveniles in the country.“It provides advisory guidelines to parents, teachers and community to protect children from being involved in delinquent behaviour through early detection, counselling and positive engagement,” the Women and Child Development Ministry, which has developed the manual, said in a statement on Wednesday.The contents of the manual draws upon basic principles laid down in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 which provides a “strong formal framework” for dealing with children in conflict with the law throughout the criminal justice process, it added.“Young children experience their world through their relationships with parents, teachers, peers and other caregivers. Therefore, there is a need to create a warm, loving and nurturing environment where their physical, emotional and spiritual needs are recognized and honoured by their family, school and community so as to allow them to reach their full potential, “ the Ministry said.The manual brought out by the Ministry aims to serve as “a guide” for parents, teachers and community members on how to prevent crime and violence by children.“Parents, teachers, and community leaders can use these questions, suggestions to help them guide their thinking, planning, action, and create a more protective and caring environment for children in society,” the Ministry said.The Manual is divided into three parts. The Part I of the manual is meant for parents while Part II and part III are for teachers and community members respectively.“Each part in this section briefly discusses few major problems that can push children on the wrong side of law, the early signs of risk, what can be done to strengthen protection or intervene to reduce risks,” the Ministry said.
