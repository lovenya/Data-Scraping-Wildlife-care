Sydney: Violence against women is an "epidemic" in Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Saturday, as thousands attended rallies in Sydney and other major Australian cities urging tougher laws on gendered violence.ADVERTISEMENTThe rallies were spurred by a wave of violence against women that the government says has seen a woman killed every four days this year. The rallies also followed a mass stabbing in Sydney this month that killed six people, including five women.Protesters demanding stronger criminal laws gathered in Sydney, capital of New South Wales state, for a rally and then a march that closed city streets. Some protesters carried signs that read "Respect" and "No More Violence".In South Australia's capital Adelaide, it was estimated around 3,000 people rallied at the city's parliament building.Prime Minister Albanese said he would be part of a rally in the national capital Canberra on Sunday."I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough," Albanese said on social media platform X.A woman has been killed every four days so far this year.
