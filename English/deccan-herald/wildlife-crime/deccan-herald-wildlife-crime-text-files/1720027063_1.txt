Congress means loot, corruption and misgovernance," he claimed, addressing a public meeting in Sawai Madhopur on the launch of the BJP's 'Parivartan Yatra'."They do not care for the peace and happiness of Rajasthan.

Nadda also named leaders of other opposition parties and alleged that they were only bothered about saving their families."They say remove Modi because they are worried about their families.
