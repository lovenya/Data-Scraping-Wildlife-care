From dousing forest fires in summer to helping out the researchers in camera-trapping of tigers and to going after poachers at Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Tiger (BRT) Reserve, he has done it all. 

And the good work of G S Pramod, a forest guard at BRT (in pic), didn’t go unnoticed. The gritty forest guard has been rewarded with the prestigious 'Wildlife Services Award-2016' in recognition of his service towards wildlife conservation. 

Pramod joined the Punajanur wildlife range in BRT Reserve in 2010. And since then, he has been working tirelessly in conserving wildlife.  

Cricketers for Tiger Conservation movement, gave away the award to Pramod, that carried a citation and a purse of Rs one lakh, at the awards ceremony held on the concluding day of  'Save the Tiger Cup', an inter-school cricket tournament.

The tournament was organised to create awareness on tiger conservation.  

Pramod, who hails from Brahmadevarahalli village in Mandya, said: "I was a primary school teacher before I joined the Forest department as guard in 2010. The biggest challenge I faced was tackling the poachers, who are believed to be the forest brigand Veerappan’s men. They were smuggling elephant tusks, tiger skins among others at BRT. Till date, I, along with colleagues, have handled more than 20 such cases."

Pramod, has a masters degree in Political Science from Karnataka State Open University, Mysuru, said the award has motivated him further to give his best.
