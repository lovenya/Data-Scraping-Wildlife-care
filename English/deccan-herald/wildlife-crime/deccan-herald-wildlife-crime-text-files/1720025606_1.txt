It is a sign of the poor law-and-order situation... that women and young girls are not safe in Delhi. Criminals committing violent crimes against women and children have no fear of quick and strong action by the Delhi Police."  	 "Today I am writing to you not just as a minister, but as a woman who lives in Delhi. Article 239AA of the Constitution gives you the responsibility of police and public order. Kindly ensure that swift and strongest possible action is taken against the perpetrators of this horrendous crime," she said. Atishi also urged him to ensure that Delhi becomes safe for women. "The women of Delhi are looking towards you to fulfil your constitutional obligation to provide them a safe city," she wrote.  	 Addressing a press conference, Kuldeep Kumar, AAP's Lok Sabha candidate from East Delhi, said the law and order situation in the national capital is deteriorating and that women did not feel safe in Delhi. He also sought time on behalf of the party to meet Saxena the discuss the matter.
