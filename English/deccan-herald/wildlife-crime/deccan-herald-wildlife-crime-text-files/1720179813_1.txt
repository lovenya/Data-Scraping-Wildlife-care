The Enforcement Directorate has arrested the MD of Lava International mobile company, a Chinese national, a Chartered Accountant and another person as part of its ongoing money-laundering probe against Chinese smartphone-maker Vivo, official sources said on Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTThe four were taken into custody under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).They are expected to be produced before a court here where the ED will seek their custody.The agency had raided the company and its linked persons in July last year, claiming to have busted a major money laundering racket involving Chinese nationals and multiple Indian companies.The ED had then alleged that a whopping Rs 62,476 crore was 'illegally' transferred by Vivo to China in order to avoid payment of taxes in India.
