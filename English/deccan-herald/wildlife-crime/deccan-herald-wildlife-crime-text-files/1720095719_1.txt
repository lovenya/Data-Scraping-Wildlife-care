Hubballi: Condemning the daylight murder of Neha Hiremath on a college campus, District Minister Santosh Lad on Friday stressed the need for bringing in laws to eliminate perpetrators of such heinous crimes through police encounters. ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of his visit to KIMS mortuary to express his heartfelt sympathies to parents of slain Neha Hiremath, the minister said, “I strongly condemn the cold-blooded murder (of Neha Hiremath) in public view. There is a need to bring in legislation to encounter those involved in such heinous crime.”“Such incidents have occurred in the past too. This is not the time to answer such questions or give counter to the opposition. BJP is politicising Neha Hiremath murder case. We should understand sensitivity (of the case) before making any statements,” Lad said.Also Read:Hubballi girl student's murder on college campus sparks protests; 'jilted lover' heldAlso Read:Hubballi girl student's murder on college campus sparks protests; 'jilted lover' heldReacting to a question, Lad said there a drug mafia is thriving in the city for a long time.“Drugs are being supplied to city from different states.
