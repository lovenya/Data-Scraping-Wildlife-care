He argued in the court that granting parole would bring the accused face-to-face with the victim, whose residence is just adjacent to the convict-petitioner's house."It will have adverse social and psychological effects on the victim, as the accused is the neighbour of the victim," he argued.The court ordered the release of Sahi Ram on his first parole for 20 days on a private bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of Rs 5,000 each and imposed a condition that he will not go to the victim's village, even if it means he has a house or family there.The convict's counsel gave an assurance to the court that he will not go to the victim's village.The high court ruled that the convict will have to serve parole outside the victim's village.
