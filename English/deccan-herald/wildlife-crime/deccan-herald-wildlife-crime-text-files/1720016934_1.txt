A report from The Indian Express said that no significant assets were found in her baggage but two dozen gold bars, allegedly in her jacket, leggings, kneecaps and waist belt. Wardak could not produce any documents to support her carrying these valuables.Wardak announced her resignation on X and stated the "attacks" on her are organised and have affected her ability to work in the role. She extended her statement saying the attacks "demonstrated the challenges faced by women in Afghan society who strive to modernise and bring positive change amidst ongoing propaganda campaigns."“It has become increasingly clear that the public narrative is unfairly targeting the only female representative within this system, rather than focussing on constructive assistance and support,” her statement reads. As per the Customs Act, 1962, an individual smuggling gold above the value of ₹1 crore is to be arrested and criminally prosecuted.
