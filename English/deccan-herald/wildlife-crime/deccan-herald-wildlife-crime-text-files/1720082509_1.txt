Wildlife expert Sanjay Gubbi urged that the Bukkapatna forest, which is the district’s largest forest area, be declared a wildlife reserve. He was speaking at a photography exhibition ‘Nisarganubhava’ organised by the Bhavalaya Trust in the city recently.

“The chinkaras, belonging to the family of antelopes, only live in the Bukkapatna forest other than in Bagalkot. Other than the chinkaras, black bucks, leopards, bears and hyenas also live in Bukkapatna forest,” he said. 

Not only does the forest house wildlife, but is also beneficial to humans as well. The forest produces rain that feeds the Boranakanive and Marikanive dams, he explained.

No tigers
There are no tigers in the district anymore. Till the 1950s, the population of tigers were high. Now only in the Devarayanadurga forest area leopards are seen. “Cameras have been installed at nine places in the district including Nidagal hill, Devarayanadurga, Pavagad, Madhugiri hill, Bukkapatna, Maidanahalli and Ramasagara,” Gubbi said. 

Swami Veereshananda Saraswathi of Ramakrishna Vivekananda Ashrama said, “In the ancient times, Indian saints played an important role in protecting animals. However, now, due to people’s indifference, animals are being killed.”

“The farmers and tribals are not destroying forests. It is the educated people who are destroying them. IF man protects a tiger, the animal will protect the forest,” he said. 

The eye-catching photographs of various wild animals and forests drew words of appreciation from the viewers. T C Suma of the Agricultural University, deputy conservator of forests Y Chakrapani, Head of Agricultural Science Centre N Loganandan, Bapuji Educational Institutions secretary M Basavaiah and others were present on the occasion.
