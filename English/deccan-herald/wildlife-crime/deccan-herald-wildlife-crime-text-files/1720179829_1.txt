The indefinite ban on university education for Afghan girls is a "disaster," according to Nilofar Bayat, a former captain of Afghanistan's wheelchair basketball team and a two-time war victim as a result of Taliban action who fled the capital Kabul after Taliban came to power in August 2021. She also added that given the restrictions Taliban have placed on women so far, the next step will be for women to not breathe or even exist in society. Afghan girls were previously forbidden from attending school, but now the terrorist group has also forbidden the girls from enrolling in universities.ADVERTISEMENT
