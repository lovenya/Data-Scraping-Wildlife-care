Dehradun-based music band 'Womaniya' has a mission -- to create awareness on crimes against women in this country. The band hopes to bring about a change through their songs.ADVERTISEMENTThese talented young musicians, through their music, are creating awareness about violence, consoling victims of rape and asking people to respect women. They are indeed a beacon of hope to women and children who fall prey to such crimes.Swati, the lead vocalist of the band, says,  'Through our music, we want to tell the authorities that action on all the crimes against women should be resolved quickly' (sic).

There seems to be no end to violence against women and children in spite of stricter punishments enforced by courts. From infants to senior citizens, no one is spared from such ghastly acts. The recent Kathua and Unnao rapes are only some of these incidents. Though this musical initiative is just a beginning, the voices of these youngsters are going to echo till a change is made.
