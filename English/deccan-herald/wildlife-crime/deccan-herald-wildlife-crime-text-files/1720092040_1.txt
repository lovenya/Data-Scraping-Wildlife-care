The press covers major crimes until arrests are made and then takes the focus off. Sometimes, even the investigation officer (IO) doesn't focus on the case. It is the responsibility of the IO to keep track of the case until the trial gets over, he explained. Citing the recent acid attack on a woman in Sunkadakatte, Reddy said that now that the suspect, Nagesh Babu, had been arrested, they would focus on filing the charge sheet at the earliest. "We will also take steps to appoint a special public prosecutor in the case and request a fast-track court for a speedy trial to punish the accused," he added. Reddy promised to carry forward the many initiatives undertaken by his predecessor, Kamal Pant, and improve their workings. During the day, Reddy also held a quick meeting with DCPs and police officers ranked above, reviewing the progress of the investigation of major crimes.
