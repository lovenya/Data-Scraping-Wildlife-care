Adam Purinton, a US Navy veteran accused of killing Indian techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla and injuring two others at a suburban Kansas City bar, has been indicted on federal hate crime and firearms charges.

The indictment of Purinton (51) of Olathe, Kansas, by a federal grand jury comes after the February 22 shooting at the city bar.

The indictment announced by the Department of Justice has accused Purinton of shooting and killing Kuchibhotla, and attempting to kill Alok Madasani, also an Indian national, because of their actual and perceived race, colour, religion and national origin.

Witnesses said Purinton yelled at the two Indian men to “get out of my country” before pulling the trigger.
Ian Grillot, a 24-year-old American man, was also injured while intervening in the shooting. 

The announcement of the indictment was made by Acting Assistant Attorney General Thomas E Wheeler, II, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and United States Attorney Thomas E Beall of the District of Kansas.

Purinton faces a maximum penalty of death or life in prison. 

The justice department will determine at a later date whether, in this particular case, it will seek the death penalty, a statement said.   

A third count in the indictment charges Purinton with violating a federal firearms statute by discharging a firearm at Kuchibhotla, Madasani and Grillot.
