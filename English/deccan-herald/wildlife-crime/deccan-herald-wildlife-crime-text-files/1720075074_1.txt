If the pilot project is successful, it will be extended to the entire state," Popli said.He said an early warning system will also be in place to caution people about the movement of elephants in their areas. There will be red light and siren to inform people about the presence of elephants in the human habitation area, he said.Under the Gajabandhu programme, five people from each village will be appointed as volunteers who will inform the forest department about the elephant movements. So far 1,200 villages have been brought under the Gajabandhu programme and another 2,000 villages will be added to the list soon, he said.The state government has also decided to set up solar power fences in Bantal of Angul district which has been identified as most prone to man-elephant conflict. Already 43 villages have been identified for the purpose, Popli said.
