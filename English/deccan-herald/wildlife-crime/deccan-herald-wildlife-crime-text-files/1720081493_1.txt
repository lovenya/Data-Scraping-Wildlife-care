Apparently wary of the negative fallout of the recent incidents of crimes in the state, especially against women, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday told police officials that he wanted “results” to “change the perception” about the law and order in the state. 

ADVERTISEMENT“Quick and effective action in cases of land grabbing and crimes against women will improve the perception among the people about the law and order in the state”, Akhilesh said, while speaking at a meeting of senior police officials to review the law and order.

“I want results... district officials must reach the spot whenever any crime takes place. They will be held responsible for any flare up”, the chief minister said, asking the police officials to gear up for the forthcoming festive season and next year’s assembly elections.

Akhilesh said that the state government was taking steps to effectively implement the ‘Dial 100’ project to ensure that the police reached the spot quickly. 

The chief minister also asked the police officials to act against the guilty without succumbing to any kind of political pressure and without discriminating against any section of the population.

It was the fourth such meeting since Akhilesh took over reins of the state after the 2012 assembly elections in the state.

Criticism over gang-rape

 Akhilesh has come under attack from different quarters in the wake of recent incidents, including the gang-rape of a minor and her mother on a highway in Bulandshahar, and lynching of a muslim man at Dadri over rumors of cooking beef, in the state.

The opposition parties, however, said that Akhilesh’s instruction to the police had come “too late”. “Akhilesh should have realized the need early, its too late now, the people of the state have already made up their mind for a change”, said BJP leader Vijay Bahadur Pathak here.
