These charges appear to be nothing more than a political conspiracy aimed at tarnishing his unblemished and non-corrupt reputation,' Lokesh said in a representation to the President. Naidu's 'illegal arrest is a culmination of vindictive politics and misuse of power that was observed right from the time YSRCP came to power', he claimed. He alleged that there has been a consistent erosion of democratic principles under current chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and his YSRCP administration in the state. 'I humbly request you to intervene in this matter and ask for your support in denouncing the baseless allegations against Chandrababu Naidu. Your support can help bring attention to the injustice that is being perpetrated against an innocent man and contribute to the greater cause of safeguarding the integrity of our political system,' Lokesh said. He also requested the President to stand by the people of Andhra Pradesh and ensure that their constitutional rights are protected and upheld. A few other TDP leaders were also present in the meeting.
