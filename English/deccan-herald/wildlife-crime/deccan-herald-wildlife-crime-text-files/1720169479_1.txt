Moreover, due to heavy rains, the leopard was in a hypothermic state.“The leopard is estimated to be around 10-12 years old. In order to increase its body temperature, we used room heaters. The blood samples have also been collected and we are waiting for the reports before deciding our course of action and what kind of diagnosis has to be provided. Currently, we have not found any physical injury, inflammation or swelling, and the leopard is able to bear weight on its legs,” Dr Chandan Sawne, Veterinary Officer, Wildlife SOS.Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder & CEO, Wildlife SOS said, “We thank the Forest Department who acted swiftly in bringing the leopard to our rescue centre. Leopards are an inherent part of the ecosystem in Maharashtra, but these big cats are facing severe anthropogenic threats such as encroachment and degradation of their natural habitat, causing them to appear in human habitations. Therefore it is crucial to save every leopard possible. Our veterinary team is highly trained and efficient in handling such delicate situations.”
