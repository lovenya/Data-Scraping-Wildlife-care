In what is seen as an attempt not to hold court proceedings, a new bill that has been proposed to replace the CrPC allows incumbent officers to appear as witnesses in place of officers and experts who actually prepared documents and reports as part of investigations into cases.ADVERTISEMENTThe existing Code of Criminal Procedure Code mandates the officers and experts who prepared documents and reports to appear as witnesses in cases even if they are moved out of the case or transferred from the position they held when the crime was committed. The new bill was introduced in Lok Sabha by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday.Officials said the new provisions, once cleared, would help personnel, as it would not bog them down. It would also speed up proceedings in courts where the presence of a particular officer is needed.According to Section 336 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Bill, 2023, the court can summon a  public servant, scientific expert, medical officer or investigating officer who has prepared a document or report related to the case during trial and other proceedings.

However, the Magistrate who has commenced a summary trial could recall any witnesses who may have been examined and proceed to re-hear the case if the court feels that the nature of the case is such that it is "undesirable" to try it summarily.
