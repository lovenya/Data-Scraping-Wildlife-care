BJP MP Locket Chatterjee broke down on Friday recounting cases of atrocities against women, including them being allegedly disrobed, in West Bengal and asked if such incidents will get attention only if their videos go viral.ADVERTISEMENTThe BJP also highlighted cases of similar crimes in Rajasthan as it amped up its campaign against opposition parties over the issue of atrocities against women, amid its rivals targeting it over a video of two women being paraded naked by a mob in strife-hit Manipur.Alleging that a "Manipur-like" situation prevails in West Bengal, state BJP president Sukanta Majumdar, who was joined by Chatterjee at a press conference, claimed that a woman was paraded naked in South Panchla for daring to contest the recent panchayat polls in West Bengal.Both the leaders, who are members of Lok Sabha, also mentioned cases of atrocities against women in Alipurduar and Birbhum to hit out at Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Also read | Manipuris treat women as their mother, incident tarnished state: CMOver 57 people have been killed in violence during and after the polls in the state, Majumdar claimed.An emotional Chatterjee was moved to tears as she spoke about these incidents."The West Bengal chief minister is silent despite being a woman. You tell us where we will go. We also want our daughters to be saved," she said crying."We are also daughters of the country. West Bengal is also part of the country," Chatterjee said, trying to compose herself.Both leaders condemned the incident in Manipur but asked if videos of similar crimes in West Bengal needed to go viral for people to pay attention to the situation there.

Rajasthan is in the number one position when it comes to crime against women, crime against children and atrocities on Dalits," Shekhawat told the press conference at the BJP headquarters here.Rajasthan is also in the number one position in corruption and the state's economy is in a "miserable" condition, he said.
