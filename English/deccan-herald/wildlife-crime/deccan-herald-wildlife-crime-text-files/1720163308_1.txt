The government is committed to protecting and upholding the rights of women, and the inquiry into the incident will be impartial, the minister said. On the police drive against illegal activities in pubs at Manipal, Hebbalkar said the government is not targeting anyone while taking action. The clubs and pubs are allowed to operate under licences and they are bound to work as per the prescribed regulations. Legitimate business activities will be allowed while action will be taken against violators. The government does not harbour any bias against specific institutions, she said.
