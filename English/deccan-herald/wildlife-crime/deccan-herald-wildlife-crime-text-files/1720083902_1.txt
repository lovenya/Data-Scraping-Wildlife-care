A Cabinet minister in Nitish Kumar's regime, Vijay Sinha, created ripples on Tuesday when he said he favoured police encounter to halt the rising crime graph of the State.ADVERTISEMENTThe minister was reacting to the charge of spiralling crime, which includes incidents of abduction, loot and murder."We have given full freedom to the police to check the rise in crime. However, if required, we are ready to give orders for police encounter too," said Sinha, who is Labour Minister in the JD(U)-led NDA government in Bihar.To buttress his point, the minister came out with the statistics of 2005 and dwelt at length how the Nitish regime had then established the rule of law through 'extraordinary' steps, 13 years ago. "The NDA Government in 2005 was able to establish the rule of law through 'tough police action' followed by speedy trial. Such was the terror of police then, that many of the hardened criminals fled the State after some of the gangsters were killed in encounter," argued Sinha."If the worsening law and order situation does not improve now, we will have no inhibitions in giving similar orders for encounter," the minister added.Unlawful, cries OppnThe Opposition RJD and the Congress reacted sharply to the minister's assertion. "In a democratic set-up, it's a very dangerous sign to issue such orders. You can't resort to unlawful methods to establish the rule of law," said RJD legislator Bhai Virendra.Congress MLA Tunna Singh suggested that "the Government should modernise police, equip cops with sophisticated weapons, increase surveillance and sharpen intelligence network rather than resorting to police encounter."
