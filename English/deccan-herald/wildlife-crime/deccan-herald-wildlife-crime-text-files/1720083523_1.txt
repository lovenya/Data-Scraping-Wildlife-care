Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said on Saturday that the government was committed to the welfare of policemen and their families. 

Siddaramaiah was speaking at the police commemoration day celebrations at KSRP grounds at Koramangala here. 

“The government is committed to the welfare of policemen and their families as cops are constantly on duty, before and after untoward incidents. In the last two years, the government has redressed pay disparity grievance of the policemen, besides providing housing facilities to them. The government has provided canteen facility and promoted a large number of lower rung staff,” he said. 

The chief minister said that a permanent venue would be allotted to organise the police commemoration day celebrations from next year.

“The government has also decided to construct a stadium for sporting activities for the policemen,” he said.

Siddaramaiah paid homage to 370 policemen and soldiers who laid down their lives while on duty. As many as 12 policemen from the state had sacrificed their lives while serving. He stressed the need to use the latest technology for prevention and detection of crimes.

“The trend of using the latest technology to commit crimes is on the rise. It will be difficult to prevent such crimes if the policemen fail to use technology. Cops should concentrate on tackling organised crimes and bust rackets,” he said. The chief minister requested the media to cooperate with the investigating agencies.

“Media wants to report instant developments, follow-ups and alerts. Probe agencies refuse to share investigation details as it affects the probe. Media houses should understand this difficulty and cooperate with the police,” he said.

Home Minister R Ramalinga Reddy, DG&IGP RK Dutta, ADGP (KSRP) Bhaskar Rao and other senior officers were present.
