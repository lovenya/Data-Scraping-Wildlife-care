The court has also ordered emergent notice to the respondents and posted the matter to October 21.Sridhar Rao, the petitioner, and another person were arrested in 2018 and were subsequently charge-sheeted in the murder case.Rao alleged that the police authorised the firm Minnow Films to make a video recording of him and interview several police officials.The petitioner was allegedly forced to give his custodial statement without authorisation or permission. He said the police forcibly took his signature on a paper given by Minnow Films when he was in their custody.On September 22, 2021, the petitioner noticed that the OTT platform released a web series documentary titled ‘Crime Stories’. In the first episode, titled ‘A Murdered Mother’, the OTT platform streamed the petitioner’s custodial investigation, interrogation and statements. It also contains a video of a purported confession.The petitioner claimed that the content severely prejudiced his right to a free and fair trial, adding, besides violation of privacy, his personal life has been shown as a commodity and he was used for a commercial story.The petitioner filed an original suit seeking permanent injunction restraining the OTT platform from streaming the documentary.He moved the high court as the civil court only issued an emergency notice and not considered the interlocutory application seeking temporary injunction.Check out DH's latest videos
