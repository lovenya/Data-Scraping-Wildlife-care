Former Kosovo president Hashim Thaci pleaded not guilty to war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 1990s conflict with Serbia as he appeared at a court in The Hague on Monday.ADVERTISEMENT"The indictment is completely without basis, and I plead not guilty to all the charges in the indictment," Thaci told the court after the judge at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers asked him how he wished to plead.
