What took it so long?Prasad exploited his position and conspired with two separate Apple vendors to defraud Apple by taking kickbacks, stealing parts, inflating invoices, and causing Apple to pay for items and services it never received – resulting in a loss to Apple of more than $17,000,000, the statement said.According to DOJ, apart from engaging in two separate criminal conspiracies with Apple vendors, Prasad also acknowledged that he evaded tax on the proceeds of his schemes.It said that by virtue of his position at Apple, Prasad was given substantial discretion to make autonomous decisions to benefit his employer. Prasad abused his power to enrich himself at his employer’s expense – all while accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of compensation from Apple in the form of salary and bonuses.Moreover, Prasad used his insider information regarding the company’s fraud-detection techniques to design his criminal schemes to avoid detection. In addition to the three-year prison sentence, a federal judge ordered Prasad to forfeit over $5,491,713 worth of assets already seized by the government.He was also ordered to pay restitution of $17,398,104 to Apple and $1,872,579 to the Internal Revenue Service, the statement added.
