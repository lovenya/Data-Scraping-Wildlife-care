When he entered the house on the night of April 24, he found chilli powder scattered across the kitchen floor and boxes torn open.   A complaint was registered at the Kengeri police station. Police questioned the neighbours, but they were not of much help. They did not find anything on the CCTV cameras around the house, too. "We learnt that the door was locked when the relative entered the house. We did not find fingerprints at the crime scene while searching for spot evidence. From this, we understood that someone known to the family has committed the crime,” an investigating officer said. The complainant mentioned to the police that Uma visited her sister often. Following this lead, the Kengeri police detained Uma and grilled her for two days, but she did not confess. "However, she eventually broke down. She made a duplicate set of the house keys before the family went to Tumakuru and used it to break in,” the police said. Police have recovered all the valuables and cash from the suspect. A court has sent Uma to judicial custody.
