'The family is very scared for him." 	Though he refused treatment at the scene, Singh says the victim was injured badly enough that he won't be able to work for the next few days."I watched the video and I was angry, I was outraged, and just moved by what happened to the victim," said Shanifah Rieara, MTA's Acting Chief Customer Officer. "New York City is a melting pot and it's from my understanding that this gentleman has only been here for about a year, and this is not how we welcome people to our city."
