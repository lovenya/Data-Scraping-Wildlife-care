It said that Punjab, Rajasthan, Goa, and Assam do not have even a single cybercrime cell, while in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, only one or two have been set up.Taking note of this, the Committee recommended that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) may advise states to set up cyber cells in all the districts.The states should map the cybercrime hotspots which will help in quick detection of the crimes and take proactive measures to prevent them.The Committee observed that these crimes are mainly related to financial transactions and criminals not only target the innocent and vulnerable, especially elderly people, and dupe them of their savings, but also well-known persons and celebrities."The Committee is of the view that specialized training is required to deal with the increasing cyber crimes in the country. The Committee recommends that the SVPNPA, NEPA should coordinate with state training academies to train police personnel with requisite knowledge of cyber laws, cybercrime investigation, and digital forensics and upgrade them from time to time on new technological tools to deal with cybercrimes," the report said."The Committee observed that the states are facing constraints of manpower and resources in managing cybercrime investigations. It recommended that the MHA should consider creating volunteer help groups of IT experts from civil society who can contribute in devising methods to track cyber thieves and bring them to justice."The State/UT police should create a cyber crime help desk for immediate reporting of the cyber crimes leading to an early investigation by them. Timely intervention could lead to the prevention of such crimes as well as relief to the victims," it added.The Committee recommended that the MHA may allocate adequate funds and extend necessary resources for the establishment of cyber training labs and to strengthen/upgrade existing cyber training infrastructure in all the states and union territories.It observed that traditional training of the police personnel is not sufficient to deal with cybercrimes as these criminals are tech-savvy and are following new modus-operandi on a regular basis.
