In Srinagar, the cases of molestation and kidnapping have been on a rise as well, compared to other districts.The increase in cases of rape, abduction, molestation and domestic violence has created a cause for concern among the civil society members and women. However, the authorities claim that several steps have been taken to curb crime against women and in 2017, six all-women police stations were established. But on ground, there has not been much change.Regional National Conference, Women Wing President, Shameema Firdous, alleges that the incumbent administration has failed to mitigate the problems concerning women in the state.“There has been a steep increase in crimes against women and the administration has failed to address the issue,” she said.People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Women Wing President, Safeena Beigh believes the number of violence cases had increased because women hesitate to come forward.“There are cases that are not reported due to the stigma attached to it. There is a need to address them to strengthen the institutions that deal with it. Everyone should come forward and the media should highlight it,” she said.
