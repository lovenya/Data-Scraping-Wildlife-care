The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Saturday held a protest against what it claimed was a steady rise in the number of crimes against Dalits and tribals under the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state. However, the plan by the protesting Madhya Pradesh Congress Scheduled Tribe Cell (MPCTC) to march to New Market area here and set afire an effigy of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was foiled by police.ADVERTISEMENTThe protest comes amid national outrage after a video showing a man, identified as Pravesh Shukla, urinating on a tribal youth in Sidhi went viral on Tuesday. MP Assembly polls are likely to be held at the end of the year.
