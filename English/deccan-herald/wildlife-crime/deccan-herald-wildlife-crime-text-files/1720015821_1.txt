Yadav is said to have made the controversial remarks while commenting on reports that Interpol had removed fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi from the list of Red Corner Notice in March. Mehta has stated in his complaint that being the Deputy CM, Yadav should not have uttered those words. Mehta has sought registration of criminal case against Yadav under sections 499 and 500 of Indian Penal Code.  Mehta has claimed in the application that he is a businessman and vice-president of All India Anti-Corruption and Crime Preventive Council (Gujarat state).
