A day after a police official Dinesh Ram was gunned down by illicit liquor traders in Sitamarhi district, Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday put Nitish Kumar regime in the dock over the sharp rise in crime. “According to a recent report of National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), there has been 101.02 % increase in crime compared to the previous RJD regime,” tweeted Tejashwi.ADVERTISEMENT“The present Government which blows its own trumpet and spreads falsehood about good governance has been thoroughly exposed,” tweeted the RJD leader in Hindi.In a separate tweet, Tejashwi, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, questioned Nitish how the liquor mafia dared to kill a police official and injure his colleague. “These liquor mafia, who have direct access to you, have shown the audacity to kill a police officer. Where and how do they get so much of strength that they kill a cop in an encounter?” blasted Tejashwi in another Hindi tweet.Tejashwi quoted NCRB report to buttress his point that those who have accused the previous RJD regime as ‘Jungle Raj’ have been presently presiding over ‘Maha Jungle Raj’ as crime figure (97,850 cases in 2005) has doubled (1,96,911) by 2018.“Nowadays, elected representatives and journalists who question the Government are also harassed by officials,” said Tejashwi, while speaking to mediamen on the Assembly premises. He cited the case of CPI-ML Mehboob Alam who had a scuffle with a police official.
