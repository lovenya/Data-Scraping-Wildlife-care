Bengalruu: Police have arrested a 41-year-old man over the brutal attack on an RSS activist nearly four years ago in Kalasipalya, West Bengaluru. ADVERTISEMENTAzhar, a native of Kolar’s Bangarpet, is the seventh person to be arrested in the case. On December 22, 2019, six armed men came on two bikes and intercepted Varun Bhopala, an RSS activist, near Kumbaragundi Road and attacked him with deadly arms. At the time, Bhopala was returning home after participating in a pro-CAA event in front of Town Hall. Police believe that the assailants initially planned to kill the prominent leaders who took part in the event, but later targeted a random person, who happened to be Bhopala. Also Read:To understand Sangh, heart is needed more than mind, says RSS leader Dattatreya HosabaleAlso Read:To understand Sangh, heart is needed more than mind, says RSS leader Dattatreya HosabaleBangalore South MP L S Tejasvi Surya and Yuva Brigade founder Chakravarthy Sulibele had taken part in the event. Following the case, Kalasipalya police opened a case of attempted murder. Azhar allegedly absconded after the attack and eventually fled to Dubai.
