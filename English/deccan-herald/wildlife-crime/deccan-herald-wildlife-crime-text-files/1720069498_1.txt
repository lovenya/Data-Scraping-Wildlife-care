Brussels/Tokyo: The European Union has said it will be "very difficult" for countries to agree on a new global treaty to tackle plastic pollution by the end of this year as planned.ADVERTISEMENTIt is the clearest sign yet that the talks, which began in 2022 and have been beset by division over whether the treaty should limit plastic production, may fail to reach a resolution by the final meeting in Busan, South Korea in late November.Around 60 countries, including EU members, have demanded production caps in the treaty but some countries including Saudi Arabia and China, which are big manufacturers of the petrochemicals that make plastics, have opposed such measures.

That could sap global enthusiasm for future treaty negotiations, said the official, who declined to be named.Graham Forbes, the head of delegation for environmental pressure group Greenpeace in the talks, said extending negotiations was better than agreeing to a weak deal."We need a framework that starts to set us on a trajectory towards a much more sustainable relationship to petrochemicals and plastics," he said."Trump or no Trump, we need an agreement that covers the full lifecycle (of plastics)."
