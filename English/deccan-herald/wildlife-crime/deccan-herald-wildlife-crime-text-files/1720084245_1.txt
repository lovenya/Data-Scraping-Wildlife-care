China believes the Lankan government and people will properly handle problems concerning its civil war and urge the international community not to complicate the issue, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said reacting to the UN report.

He said Colombo has already set up its own panel to investigate relevant issues. "The Chinese side is confident that Sri Lankan government and people are able to properly address all relevant issues," Hong said in a statement.

"We hope that the international community could help develop a favourable external environment for the Sri Lankan government to stabilise the country's internal situation and accelerate economic growth, and avoid taking measures that could further complicate the issue," Hong said.

The UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka published a report on armed conflicts in the country on Monday.

It said the activities by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the government in the final months of civil war might amount to war crimes.

Lanka's External Affairs Ministry denounced the report, saying it was fundamentally flawed in many aspects and has divisive influence on the country that has just ended its decades old conflict.

Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the three decades civil war that erupted in 1983 between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE, who had launched a separatist insurgency for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east before they were defeated in May 2009.ADVERTISEMENT
