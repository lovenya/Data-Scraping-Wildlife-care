Union Minister Maneka Gandhi today said the Supreme Court verdict in the December 16 gangrape case will act as a "deterrent" against such heinous crimes.

"It has been five years, but in this country getting justice takes decades. So justice definitely has been done. I am happy. The whole country is happy," she told reporters.

Asked about the juvenile convict who was released earlier, she said the law did not permit enhanced punishment in his case. A judgement like this was necessary to send a stern message to people who commit such heinous crimes, the Minister said.ADVERTISEMENT
