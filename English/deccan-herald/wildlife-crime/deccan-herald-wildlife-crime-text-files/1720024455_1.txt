Haveri SP and the state Home Minister G Parameshwara are not ready to accept it but now they themselves have suspended some policemen in Hangal, which is an admission of omission by the police,” Bommai said in a statement.Alleging that the Hangal police did not act according to law, Bommai said the victim is not getting proper treatment.“The CM is also ignoring this case. His refusal to set up an SIT is like giving strength to the perpetrators. Therefore, we have decided to protest in front of the Haveri SP office on January 20, demanding an investigation by SIT,” the BJP leader said.
