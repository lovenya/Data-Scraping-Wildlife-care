Sanjay then bought a litre of petrol from a nearby petrol pump and handed it to her following her threat. The situation escalated when she allegedly poured the petrol on him and ignited it. Realising the severity of her actions, she attempted to extinguish the flames by dousing Sanjay with water and then took him to the hospital.An investigating officer told DH that Sanjay initially claimed the incident was an accident. However, he revised his statement on December 19, leading to the current developments in the investigation.
