DGGI has unravelled cases using data analysis aided by advanced technical tools, leading to the arrest of tax evaders. These tax syndicates often use gullible persons and enticed them with jobs/commission/bank loan, etc, to extract their Know Your Customers (KYC) documents, which were then used to create fake/shell firms/companies without their knowledge and consent. In some cases, KYC method was used with the knowledge of the person concerned by paying them small pecuniary benefits, the ministry added.
