Pune: Pune police on Thursday rejected former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s claim that attempts are being made to show that the Porsche crash victims were drunk, asserting that their conduct is immaterial in this case.ADVERTISEMENTIn a post on X, Deshmukh said the blood samples of the juvenile allegedly involved in the accident were first swapped to project that he was not drunk.

He added that the viscera report is pending.Also Read:Pune Porsche crash: CCTV footage shows bribe exchanging handsAlso Read:Pune Porsche crash: CCTV footage shows bribe exchanging handsTechies Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, who were returning from a party at a hotel in Pune’s Kalyani Nagar, died after the Porsche rammed into their bike in the early hours of May 19.The teenager is currently in an observation home till June 25.
