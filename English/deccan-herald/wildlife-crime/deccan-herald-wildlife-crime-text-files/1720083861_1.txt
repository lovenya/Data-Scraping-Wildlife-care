Chikkanna, playing a cop, weaves comedy into a serious investigation.Director and writer Guru Deshpande says he set out to make a film that would not only entertain people but also offer food for thought. Deshpande has earlier directed Yash in 'Raja Huli' (2013) and Yogesh in 'John Jani Janardhan' (2016).   "Four characters throw light on socially relevant issues in the course of a revenge drama. Every character undergoes a transformation,"  he explains.  The director hopes the blend of action, comedy and romance will make 'Samhaara' an interesting watch.Chiranjeevi Sarja  
says, "In the first half, I portray a visually  impaired chef. He  undergoes a transformation  in the second half after his vision  is restored. I enjoyed
playing a chef because  I love cooking in real  life. So cutting, slicing  and cooking came  naturally to me. The  challenging part was  dealing with the fight
sequences as a visually  impaired person.  I had to tweak my  expression and body language."Kavya Shetty
says, "I play a journalist.  I come across  as an extremely  playful, happy-go lucky  girl. I didn't  have to take any  extra effort to play  my part. There's
comedy, romance  and a suspense  element smuggled  into the film. It's a
gripping story."Hariprriya says, "I am  the heroine and the  villain. I thoroughly  enjoyed playing the bad  girl. My transformation  from an innocent-looking  girl to someone
with an agenda wasn't  easy. I had to work on  my expressions. I felt  one with my character  only after I got a hang  of how to go about it."Nina C George
