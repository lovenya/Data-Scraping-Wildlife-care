They told Prasad that his debit card was about to expire.In his complaint at the cyber crime police station on Tuesday, the senior official said he was in a hurry and shared the bank details with the caller, and another call was made.But when he received a text message, reporting the withdrawal of Rs 2 lakh from two of his bank accounts, he realised he was defrauded and called his bank to block the debit cards. Prasad also confirmed that he lost the money.In 2015, the then Director General of Police Om Prakash also fell victim to the trickeries of cyber criminals and lost Rs 10,000.
