Kashmir-based women’s rights activist Ezabir Ali fears that the silence by the society on such brutal atrocities will only increase the violence.“Indifferent behavior of the society towards crimes against women will shrink the spaces for women in society. This will certainly restrict the mobility of women and girls and they will not be allowed by their families to step out alone,” she explains.In 2015, Valley’s head priest Mirwaiz Umar Farooq had called for boycotting the households demanding dowry and abetting married women to suicide. He had also appealed to the women facing the brunt of domestic violence to show strength by informing their local Masjid management and the concerned organizations or rights bodies about what they were being subjected to.However, seven years down the line the situation has only worsened in Kashmir and women have been suffering silently.
