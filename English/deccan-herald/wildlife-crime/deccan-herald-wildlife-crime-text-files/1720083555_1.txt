The gruesome murder of 7-year-old Pradyumn continues to haunt Gurgaon. Almost two months after Pradyumn was found dead with a slashed throat in a bloody bathroom of Ryan International School, and the police were nowhere near closing the case, despite clear evidence, CCTV footage and a confession from the bus driver. However, recently, a new development came to light: the actual murderer was not the one the police was claiming to be, but a boy from Class XI.

Now, the CBI is attempting to reconstruct the events leading to the crime by taking the accused to knife shops and his school to learn first-hand how he did what he did. The CBI is allowed to take custody of the boy from 10 AM to 6 PM, following which he is returned to an observation home in Delhi.

Meanwhile, the Gurgaon police are in hot water for "uncovering" the murder weapon and taking the bus conductor as a suspect in the murder. The real murder weapon has been recovered from the commode of one of the toilets in the washroom. The conductor, Ashok Kumar, has declared his intention to sue the police for defamation and torture, while his counsel says that Ashok was made a scapegoat to protect the real accused of the murder.

The boy allegedly killed Pradyumn because he wanted to postpone the exam and the parents-teacher meet, and since the day he slashed his junior's life away, spoke not a word of what he had done and did not show even a shred of remorse when the police brought him in for initial questioning right after the murder, but contradictions in his statements to the police and CBI led them to get suspicious and take him in.
