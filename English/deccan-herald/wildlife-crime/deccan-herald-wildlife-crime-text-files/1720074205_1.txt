Speaking to the publication, Perth-based entomologist and curator of Entomology at the Western Australian Museum, Nikolai Tatarnic, identified the creature as "a walking stick insect in the family Phasmatidae”."We think the insect in the clip is the genus Paronchestus, probably P cornutus, as it closely resembles a specimen in our collection, which was collected from Laverton," he said. “While most people are aware of their camouflage (ie, looking like a stick), some species also engage in threat or startle displays (also called ‘deimatic behaviour’) to ward off potential predators," he added.Phasmids are found all across Australia, but because of their amazing camouflage, they mostly go unseen, the expert added.
