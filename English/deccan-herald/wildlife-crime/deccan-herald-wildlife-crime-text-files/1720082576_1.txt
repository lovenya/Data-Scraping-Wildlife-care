Home Minister G Parameshwara on Monday called upon media professionals to be sensitive while reporting crimes involving women and children.

ADVERTISEMENTDelivering a key note address during  a two-day workshop ‘Gender Sensitive Best Practice, Implementation and Capacity Building of Police Officials’ at the Police Commissioner’s office here, he said: “There was an incident on December 31, 2016, in the city. It came to light on January 2, 2017, while a section of media blew it out of proportion as an incident of mass molestation. But, what had happened on that night was totally different. 

Police Commissioner Praveen Sood himself verified footage of as many as 80 CCTV cameras, but there was no incident of mass molestation. The incident brought disrepute to Bengaluru and the police department.” “Media should be sensitive especially while dealing with crimes involving women and children. Damage will be done by the time truth comes to light due to insensitivity while highlighting issues,” he said. He also announced a new state-of-the-art forensic science laboratory. 

False rape claims may invite action

The police may take action against women lodging false complaint of molestation and uploading false posts of molestation on social media platforms.

“False complaints of molestation are increasing in Bengaluru. The government will address such issues within legal framework to prevent misuse of law,” Home Minister G Parameshwara said.
