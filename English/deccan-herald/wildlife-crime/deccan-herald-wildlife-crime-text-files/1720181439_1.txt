A 25-year-old youth was allegedly stabbed to death in Nangloi area of Delhi on February 14. The deceased has been identified as Sahil Malik. Sahil was allegedly stabbed to death over a brawl with a RTV bus driver. ADVERTISEMENT“My nephew Vishal Malik was returning from a gym when he had an argument with an RTV bus driver over some issue. They were 8-10 people and they thrashed him. He left his bike there and managed to escape. He went to Nangloi PS and sought help but police didn't help him. Later, he called his brother Sahil and asked him to bring the bike. When Sahil went there, they attacked him with a knife and he died on spot,” said Khaleel Malik, uncle of the deceased.
