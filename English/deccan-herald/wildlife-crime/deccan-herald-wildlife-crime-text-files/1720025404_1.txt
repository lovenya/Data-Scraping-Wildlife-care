They alleged that the accused had raped their daughter, who was 15 years old at the time of the crime, on the promise of marriage. After the victim became pregnant, the accused refused to marry her. On October 13, 2017, the special court at Davangere acquitted the accused, holding that the victim was major and it was consensual sex. The high court government pleader argued that the evidence of the victim was not discarded and since she was a minor at that time, the question of consent didn't arise. It was also stated that the victim had delivered a baby boy who died within two days after birth. The division bench noted that the prosecution evidence about the age of the victim revealed that she was a minor. The court also said it cannot be said that the victim had consented to sexual intercourse merely because she did not file a police complaint immediately after the incident.
