Turkey said on Thursday it had captured Hakan Ayik, a fugitive wanted in Australia for drug smuggling, among 36 others involved in an "international armed organised crime organisation" also pursued by U.S. and New Zealand authorities.ADVERTISEMENTTurkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the detentions in Istanbul targeted the organisation that was allegedly involved in drug trafficking, manslaughter, armed looting and money laundering globally.Yerlikaya said that Ayik, also known as Reis, and Duax Arif Tavukcu, have led the crime ring since last year. Ayik is wanted by U.S. and Australian authorities while Tavukcu is wanted in New Zealand, he said.Ayik - dubbed the "Facebook gangster" in Australian media - has been on the most wanted list in New South Wales state for a decade, sought for the "supply of large commercial quantities of drugs".In 2010, Australian police arrested associates of Ayik in relation to a large drug shipment. Ayik did not return from a trip to Hong Kong. Interpol issued a warrant for his arrest.A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation indictment unsealed in 2021 says that Ayik was one of three administrators and four influencers identified in establishing and popularising the An0m app among criminal networks.Users thought the app was encrypted but it was actually controlled by the FBI who could monitor their conversations.
