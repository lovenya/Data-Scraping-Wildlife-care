Bengaluru: A 20-year-old college girl was found with her throat and wrist slit in the bathroom of her house in southern Bengaluru’s Subramanyapura on Wednesday, police said. ADVERTISEMENTPrabudhya, a second-year BBA student at a private women's college in southern Bengaluru, is suspected to have died between 4.30 pm and 5.30 pm when no one was home. Her mother was away at work and her brother had stepped out to play, police said. Police were notified about the incident around 7.30 pm, shortly after Prabudhya's mother came home and found the front door locked and back door open. While the police found a small knife at the crime scene and believe it was used to slit the throat and the wrist, they are not certain if it's a case of murder or suicide. The mother, however, suspects foul play and has filed a police complaint, a senior police officer said. Also Read:Bengaluru BTech student suicide: Cops file Unnatural Death ReportAlso Read:Bengaluru BTech student suicide: Cops file Unnatural Death ReportLokesh Jagalasar, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South), told DH that a death note and a small knife were found at the scene. Police are waiting for the post-mortem report and will launch an investigation based on that.
