Mysuru: Dasara jumbo Arjuna had assisted the team in capturing six out of nine elephants in the operations held at Aalur, Belur, Sakleshpur and Yesalur ranges within Hassan Wildlife Division, before his death in a wild elephant attack. ADVERTISEMENTNagarahole Tiger Reserve Veterinarian Dr H Ramesha who has participated in 65 elephant capture operations and has darted 45 elephants, seven tigers, 50 leopards and 10 sloth bears in the past five years, described the 11th day operation at KFDC grove near Dabballi Katte in Yesalur range of Hassan division as one of the most complicated operations which he has ever had to undertake. "In fact, Arjuna has attained 'veera marana', and it is only because of him the lives of seven to eight people who were there at the time could be saved," he said in an exclusive interview with DH.

But he had to be taken along for the operation at Hassan to put radio collars on nine elephants. We left on November 24 with six elephants including Arjuna, DRFO of Dubaare Elephant camp and a sharpshooter named Ranjan," he said. "We were supposed to capture nine elephants and put radio collar on three female elephants. We had already captured and put radio collar on three female elephants and three tuskers (out of which one was relocated to Bandipur and two to Nagarahole)," he added. "As per the SOP, an elephant in 'musth' can be used for an operation when its mahout has confidence in its fitness and capability. Also, it is an added advantage to use an elephant in musth for the operation, as wild elephants tend to move away due to the smell (of the elephant in musth). Also, an elephant which has crossed 60 years of age, should not carry heavy weight but can be used for such operations," Dr Ramesha said.
