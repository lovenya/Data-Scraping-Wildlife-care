The counsel also submitted the police sent notices to lawyers who produced a "fact-finding" report.The plea claimed alleged hate crimes, perpetrated by organised mobs, included damage to mosques, burning of business establishments owned by Muslims, organising rallies, shouting Islamophobic and genocidal hate slogans and delivering hate speeches targeting Muslims in various parts of Tripura."Despite the gravity and sheer magnitude of the incidents, no concrete steps have been taken against the miscreants and rioters. It is pertinent to note that no arrests have been made of persons, responsible for desecrating mosques or vandalising shops and delivering hate speeches targeting the Muslim community," the plea contended.It accused the state government authorities and the police of being hand in glove with the perpetrators of the alleged hate crimes and initially denying reports of any mosque being set ablaze. "Eventually police protection was extended to several mosques; orders were issued under Section 144 IPC; and compensation was also announced for the victims of the violence," it pointed out.The petitioner asked the court to issue direction to ensure that an independent, credible and impartial investigation is conducted into the incidents of violence against the Muslim community as noted by the fact-finding report titled 'Humanity Under Attack in Tripura' by SIT.Check out DH's latest videos:
