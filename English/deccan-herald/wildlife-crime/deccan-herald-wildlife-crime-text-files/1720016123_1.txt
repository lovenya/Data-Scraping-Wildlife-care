Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Police on Saturday registered a case against noted Mohiniyattam dancer Kalamandalam Satyabhama over her controversial remarks allegedly against a fellow artiste.ADVERTISEMENT The Cantonment police here registered the case based on a complaint filed by noted Mohiniyattam dancer RLV Ramakrishnan. As a video clip of Satyabhama's remarks made on a YouTube channel went viral on social media and was aired on news channels last week, Ramakrishnan had alleged that her comments were directed at him and threatened to initiate legal action against her. The video and her subsequent statements defending what she had said were severely criticised by many on social media, cutting across political lines."We have received the complaint here today and a case was registered against Satyabhama under various sections of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act," a police officer told PTI. Further proceedings in the case would be decided later, he added. In the purported interview, Sathyabhama had said, "The person who performs Mohiniyattam should be 'mohini' (enchanting). He has the colour of a crow. This is an art form that requires a stance that keeps the legs wide apart. There is nothing more repulsive than a man who performs with his legs wide apart in this manner." 	 "In my opinion, men should perform Mohiniyattam only if they are that good looking...But his looks are unbearable," she added.Also Read:Man booked for abusing Kerala CM through microphoneAlso Read:Man booked for abusing Kerala CM through microphone Satyabhama, however, had not specified whom she was referring to.
