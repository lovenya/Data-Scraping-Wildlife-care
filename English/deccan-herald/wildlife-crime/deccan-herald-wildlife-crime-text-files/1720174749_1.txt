Panic moments prevailed as an eight-year-old male leopard which had entered a house and injured a couple had hidden at the same house on Wednesday night around 3 am at Moodanahalli of KRPet taluk of Mandya district.ADVERTISEMENTUnaware of leopard hiding in the house, the forest officials who went inside the house for spot inspection, were shocked to realise the presence of leopard in the house. Surprisingly it had sat quietly amid the cows and goats at the home after killing one goat. They immediately came out and locked the house. After an operation by a team of 30 members they rescued the leopard around 12.15pm on Thursday, according to KRPet Range Forest Officer H S Gangadhar. Gangadhar explained, "The incident occurred, when the couple who had the cattle shed at their home with few cows and goats, had slept without closing the door. As the leopard walked inside the home, it has attacked and injured both hands of 58 year old Gauramma. Later, it has attacked and injured face of her husband 71 year old Ningegowda who came to Gauramma's rescue. Gauramma has hit on the leopard's head with a stick, and the couple have rushed out of the house."  Read | Leopard sighting?
