After spending a couple of days there, she told the staff of the serviced apartment that she needed to travel to Bengaluru for work and insisted on a taxi despite them telling her that a flight would be cheaper. On January 8, she left for Bengaluru and the staff came across blood stains on a towel in the room when they went in to clean up after her. They immediately informed the police and shared that her son was not with her when Suchana left, adding that the bag she was carrying was unusually heavy, The Hindustan Times reported. When the police contacted her, Suchana attributed the bloodstains to her period and said her son was with a friend in South Goa, going so far as to providing an address. The police verified and found the address to be fake. The cops then contacted the taxi driver who was supposed to take her to Bengaluru, and instructed him to take her to the nearest police station instead. The cabbie took her to the station in Chitradurga where Goa cops arrived with a transit remand. Her husband, who is reportedly in Jakarta at present, has been informed of the situation, the police told HT.
