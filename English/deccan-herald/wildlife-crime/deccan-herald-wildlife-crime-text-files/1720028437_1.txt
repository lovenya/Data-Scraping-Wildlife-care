According to the prosecution, the woman left her husband, who was mentally unstable and was living with Shishupalan, who had also molested the elder daughter of the woman. "A case was registered in that case too and the trial has started," Mohan said.  The incident came to light after the grandmother of the children lodged a complaint with the authorities.  The children are currently residing in a Children's home. The court examined 22 witnesses and 33 documents for convicting and sentencing the accused.
