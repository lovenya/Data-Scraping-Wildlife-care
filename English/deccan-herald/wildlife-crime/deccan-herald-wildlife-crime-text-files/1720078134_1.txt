Manas National Park, another home of the rhinos in Assam, however, reported rhino poaching cases in 2023. With 2,613 rhinos, the 1,300sq km Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve is the biggest habitat of the famous one-horned rhinos and is a Unesco World Heritage Site. Kaziranga is also one of the biggest tourist centres in the country. But the threat of poaching has still remained a concern. Rhino horns are smuggled by an international gang of wildlife parts traders to Southeast Asian nations, mainly to China. The parts are used in preparation of traditional medicines and for decorative items.
