They are also more likely to experience violence and sexual exploitation in multiple forms and degrees," said Mahara.Emphasising on the emerging need of a strong child protection mechanism, Mahara said over the past few years, some progress has indeed been made in terms of girls' education and strengthening child protection systems, but the pandemic has derailed the growth.Since the vulnerability has now increased multifold, chances of girls dropping out of the education system and falling from the protection safety-net has correspondingly increased, she added.Mahara said girls, particularly the ones in their adolescence, face many protection risks during and after any humanitarian crisis."Given the immediate and long-term risks arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the need of the hour is therefore to reinforce gender responsive protection interventions and ensure that these are implemented to the fullest,” she said.Check out DH's latest videos:
