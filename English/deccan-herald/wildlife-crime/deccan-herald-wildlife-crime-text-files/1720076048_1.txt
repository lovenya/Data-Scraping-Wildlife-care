After getting information, wildlife watchers and villagers have recovered the body.'.Proposals will be submitted to the state government for fencing of vulnerable villages located inside the wildlife sanctuary and setting up solar street lights so that the villagers can watch the movement of wild animals, he said.The deceasedâ€™s family will get a compensation of Rs 6 lakh. An amount of Rs 60,000 will be given to the family immediately for performing last rites, the forest ranger said."We have earlier noticed movement of only one leopard inside the sanctuary. Now, the villagers are saying two leopards are there. We will examine," said Mahadev Badaik, divisional forest officer (DFO), Nuapada.The repeated attack of the leopard in human habitation also indicates that it might not be able to get sufficient food (prey animals) inside the jungle, he said.
