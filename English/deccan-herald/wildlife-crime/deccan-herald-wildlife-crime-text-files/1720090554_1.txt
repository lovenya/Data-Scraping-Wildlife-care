Shocked by the Sakinaka murder-rape in Mumbai that bore similarity to the Nirbhaya incident, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has swung into action and a team visited Mumbai on Sunday.ADVERTISEMENTThe NCW has also taken objection to Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale’s statement, who had said, “Police reached the spot within ten minutes. It can't be present at every crime location. They will reach only after getting information. Police worked to the best of their capability.”“The statement is extremely unfortunate. Police can't run away from their responsibility,” NCW member Chandramukhi Devi stated.
