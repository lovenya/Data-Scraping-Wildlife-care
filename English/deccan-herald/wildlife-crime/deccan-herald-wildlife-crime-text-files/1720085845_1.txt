Amidst mounting pressure and criticism, the Maharashtra government on Thursday handed over the investigations of the case involving suicide of Dr. Payal Tadvi to the Mumbai Crime Branch-CID.

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the home portfolio, had taken series cognizance of the incident.

The Agripada police station will be handing over the case papers to the Crime Branch.

Three lady doctors - Dr. Bhakti Meher, Dr. Hema Ahuja, and Dr. Ankita Khandelwal - who are under arrest, will be produced in the Mumbai sessions court on Friday on expiry of the three-day police remand.

"The case has been handed over to the Crime Branch, as we demanded," advocate Nitin Satpute, who represents the Tadvi family said.ADVERTISEMENT
