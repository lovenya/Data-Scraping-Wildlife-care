Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday expressed hope that the Congress' Bharat Jodo Yatra would bring about a change in atmosphere in the country.ADVERTISEMENT"Rahul Gandhi started the Bharat Jodo Yatra in protest against rising inflation, unemployment, hatred and violence in the country. In many states, the situation is such that criticising the government has become a crime. Seeing the success of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, even the statements of BJP, RSS leaders have started changing," Gehlot said in a tweet in Hindi.श्री राहुल गांधी ने देश में बढ़ रही महंगाई, बेरोजगारी, नफरत और हिंसा के माहौल के विरोध में भारत जोड़ो यात्रा शुरू की थी।कई राज्यों में तो ऐसी स्थिति बन गई है कि सरकार की आलोचना करना एक अपराध बन गया हो।भारत जोड़ो यात्रा की सफलता को देखकर BJP,RSS नेताओं तक के बयान भी बदलने लगे हैं।— Ashok Gehlot (@ashokgehlot51) October 22, 2022The Congress' 3,570-km long Bharat Jodo Yatra began from Kanyakumari on September 8.
