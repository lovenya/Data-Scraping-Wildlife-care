That it provides relief to Delhiites from tiresome drudgery is well known, what is not is that the National Zoological park here has also branched into research, offering internship and field training in wild life and environment conservation.

ADVERTISEMENT“Delhi zoo is providing internship training to Bachelor of Veterinary Science (B.V.Sc) students from Haryana Agricultural & Veterinary University, Hissar. The Indian Forest Service probationers from Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), Dehradun, and trainee officers of Diploma in Wild life Management from Wild Life Institute Of India also visit the zoo for their field training,” Riyaz Khan, zoo curator said.

“We are calling for entries to our research programme. All interested students and research scholars can write to nzpnewdelhi@gmail.com with the details of their project,” he said.

The official said the zoo was an ideal destination for a range of environment and conservation studies as it houses around 1,355 species of birds and animals.

“Many research studies are being undertaken at the zoo. For example, we have the rare species of black kites and the largest number of brow antlered deer at the zoo. Research enthusiasts from all over the country visit the zoo, given the variety of flora and fauna here,” Khan said.

Delhi zoo is also a part of the conservation breeding programmes of the Central Zoo Authority for the Royal Bengal tiger, Indian rhinoceros, swamp deer, Asiatic lion, brow antlered deer and red jungle fowl. An official of the zoo’s research department said trainee officers of various forestry colleges and institutions are imparted field training there.

“The training workshops are also organised for capacity building of zoo personnel from time to time,” he said.
