The cub was identified as a male and was estimated to be 45 days old. Once declared fit for the reunion, the cub was taken back to the location from where he was discovered.The team placed the cub in a safe box and for the reunion to be a success, the box was lined with the cubs’ urine drops. After a few hours, camera traps set up by the team captured the heartwarming moment of the female leopard finding her cub and carrying him away to a safer location.Dr Chandan Sawane, Veterinary Officer, Wildlife SOS said, “Lining the box with the cub’s urine acts as a scent marking to assist the mother leopard in locating him more easily. The leopard’s mother cautiously approached the safety box as seen in the camera trap footage. After scanning the area for any danger, she cleverly used her paw to tip the box over, and safely carried away her cub to a safe location.”Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS said, “It is remarkable to think that this was our 100th successful leopard cub reunion. Since 2009, Wildlife SOS has been proactively involved in every harvesting season to protect and conserve the Indian Leopard through reunion operations. Over a decade of rescue, awareness and sensitisation efforts have led to this milestone. As a result, the farmers and villagers sharing space with leopards have become more tolerant and responsible as well.”
