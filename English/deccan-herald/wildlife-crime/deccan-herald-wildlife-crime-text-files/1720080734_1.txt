The state government has opposed the PU leak suspects’ petition for quashing of the FIR against them and against invoking of the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act, 2000, saying they ran an “organised crime syndicate”. 

In its statement of objections before the High Court, the government said that prime suspect Shivakumaraiah, his nephew Kumaraswamy alias Kiran and another suspect Eramallappa were involved in several cases of paper leak.

They were booked for common offences in several cases and had formed an “organised crime syndicate” for pecuniary benefits. The statement said Shivakumaraiah had been booked in five different cases. He was acquitted in three and is being tried in two. 

Kumaraswamy has been booked in three cases and was acquitted in two. Eramallappa was booked in two cases and acquitted in one. “Rs one lakh was recovered from Eramallappa during investigation. Police booked them under the KCOC Act after due application of mind and diligence,” the statement said. 

Agony of students
The II PUC Chemistry exam was cancelled twice in March this year after the paper leaked, putting lakhs of students and parents through tremendous agony and hardship, it said. 

“It caused tremendous setback to meritorious students who were preparing to appear in various competitive entrance examinations at state level and all-India level like CET, COMEDK and JEE etc. (sic)” 

The suspects had bribed Santosh Parshuram Agasimani, a Second Division Assistant (SDA) at Hangal sub-treasury in Haveri district, gained access to the strongroom where the question papers were stored, took photographs of the paper and later sold its photocopies to students and parents. 

The suspects have approached the High Court seeking quashing of the FIR and against invoking the KCOC Act against them. 

Justice H Billappa adjourned the next hearing until Wednesday for dictating the orders.
