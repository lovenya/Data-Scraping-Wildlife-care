A team of three to five officials will count the elephants in each block with an area of four to six square kilometre each. In Kerala there are 610 blocks in the four elephant reserves. On day two dung based counting will be carried out and on day three water hole counting in which elephants visiting water bodies will be counted. The data from states will be compiled and a draft report will be prepared by June and the final report will be ready by July.A water hole counting done last year estimated the number of wild elephants at 2386.
