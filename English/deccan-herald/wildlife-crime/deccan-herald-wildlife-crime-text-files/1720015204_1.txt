He urged for collaborative efforts to maintain peace and security in the state. 	He claimed that there was a deeper connection between Noronha and top Sena (UBT) leaders. He also showed what he claimed were clippings from Sena (UBT) mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ carrying photos of Noronha with leaders from the Thackeray-led party. 	Samant countered Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut’s claim that Noronha had met Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde a few days ago, calling it a mischief. 	Referring to the conversation between Ghosalkar and Noronha, Samant said, “When two leaders of the (Sena) UBT are discussing their plans, how does Shiv Sena come into the picture?”  	He also called for a thorough investigation into the circumstances leading up to the murder. 	Responding to queries about the demand for President’s Rule in the state, Samant said no such calls were made after the Palghar incident, referring to the lynching of two sadhus on the suspicion of being child stealers in 2020.
