Delhi Police Commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi on Thursday launched an online complaint lodging system for economic and cyber offences. This aims to further digitise police procedures. 
Currently, police have an applications for e-FIR of theft victims. “It would provide easy and 24X7 accessibility for remotely lodging complaints. We will also provide prompt status update to the complainants and help senior officers monitor the complaints,” Bassi said.
The project has been developed under the supervision of Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) Satish Golchha and Deputy Commissioner of Police (EOW) B K Singh.
In view of the spurt in cybercrimes in recent years, dedicated investigating teams referred to as ‘cyber teams’ have also been constituted at all police stations.
The police station cyber teams will each comprise two sub-inspectors and two juniors. They will work under the supervision of inspector (investigation) of the police station.
In addition, a specialised and dedicated ‘district cyber cell’ has also been established in all the districts. 
They will be equipped with gadgets needed for forensic analysis of hard disks and mobile phones.
The police station cyber teams will investigate complaints and cases related to social networking websites, hacking and unauthorised access into e-mails and bank accounts. “Training has been provided to the members of these teams by the cyber crime cell of EOW,” Bassi said.
