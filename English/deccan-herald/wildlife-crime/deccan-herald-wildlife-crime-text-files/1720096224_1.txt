Therefore, since it is being cryptic and since it suffers from the vice of non-application of mind, the same cannot be sustained in the eye of law. It is accordingly quashed.”The petitioners had contended that the Hesaraghatta region situated in Bengaluru "is of ecological significance and requires protection. The region forms a unique ecosystem and supports numerous species of flora and fauna, many of which are endangered." The Chief Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru had filed a detailed report with the Board to consider and declare Hesaraghatta Grasslands as Greater Hesaraghatta Grasslands Conserve Reserve citing that it was the only remaining grassland region in Bengaluru.
