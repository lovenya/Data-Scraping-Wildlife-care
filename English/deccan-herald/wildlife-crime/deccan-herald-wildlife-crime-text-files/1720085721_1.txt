As a way to preserve wildlife habitats impacted by the Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg project, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India.

Under the MoU, a study will be conducted on wildlife habitats affected by the project's Nagpur Mumbai Super Communication Expressway and steps will be initiated to protect them. Post-construction, one of the focus areas will be to ensure unrestricted movement of wildlife.

The institute will submit a recommendation report to the MSRDC. When the construction of the expressway is complete, measures will be taken to ensure that there are no threats to wildlife.

The Wildlife Institute of India, under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, will partner with the MSRDC till the completion of the Maharashtra Samrudhi Mahamarg.ADVERTISEMENTâ€œMSRDC is sensitive to the issue of conserving wildlife and committed to maintain their habitat," said Radheshyam Mopalwar, MSRDC Vice Chairman and Managing Director. "We are determined that Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg will serve as a model project for the protection of wildlife. Therefore, we are extremely keen to develop the interests of wildlife in the sanctuaries falling along the expressway." Two wildlife sanctuaries fall within 26 talukas and 390 villages that will be connected through the expressway, in addition to three major cities of Nagpur, Aurangabad and Mumbai. The MSRDC will take help from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, to ensure that the wildlife is not threatened by vehicular traffic on the expressway.READ MORE: Mumbai-Nagpur expressway: 8 lakh trees to be planted
