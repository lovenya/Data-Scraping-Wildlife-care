Police have registered an FIR against drunk revellers for causing a nuisance near a restaurant on Queen's Road in central Bengaluru on Sunday night. A group of four drunk men tried to enter the restaurant, which has a couple-only entry policy. When a restaurant guard tried to stop the group, the drunk men hurled abuses at him and pushed him away. They also started abusing passersby and others who tried to intervene. The group eventually left by hailing a cab, police said. ADVERTISEMENTThe restaurant owner filed a police complaint on Monday morning. Vidhana Soudha police registered a case under IPC sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 504 (punishment for intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 268 (punishment for causing a public nuisance), but are yet to make any arrests, an officer said.
