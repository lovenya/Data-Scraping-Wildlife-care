Funding under corporate social responsibility (CSR) in wildlife areas is a problem because corporates prefer locations closer to their work place and visibility becomes a challenge, according to Vinay Lutra, executive committee chairman of Karnataka Eco-Tourism Development Board (KETDB).

“But this mindset is gradually changing now,’’ he said on Tuesday, during a day-long workshop on “Support the Tiger’’, organised by KETDB. In the last three years, KETDB has managed to get donations worth Rs 35 crore under CSR for installing camera traps, funding school books and education of staff children, providing vehicles, setting up interpretation centres or funding wildlife films.

Presentations and ideas were exchanged between forest department officials and around 50 company delegates during the workshop. Ideas worth Rs 730 crore were exchanged and many companies decided to come up with concrete proposals. The department said corporates could also adopt and conserve over 20,000 hectares of forests in and around Bengaluru urban and rural or improve infrastructure.

“We want to involve people and inculcate in them a sense of ownership. Earlier, people would prefer to fund projects in Bandipur and Nagarhole tiger reserves. Funds have poured in for projects in Dandeli, Bhadra, Bheemgad, Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and Daroji Sloth bear sanctuary,” Lutra said.
