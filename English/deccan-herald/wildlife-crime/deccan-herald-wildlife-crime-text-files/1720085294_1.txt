Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the latest allegations in connection with the war within CBI are part of the latest episode of a "crime thriller 'Chowkidar is thief' playing out" in the capital.ADVERTISEMENTOpposition leaders like CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, LJD's Sharad Yadavm too targeted the Modi government.Gandhi's remarks came a day after senior CBI official M K Sinha claimed in a petition before Supreme Court that Minister of State Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief Vigilance Commissioner K V Chowdhury and Law Secretary Satish Chandra attempted to interfere in the probe against CBI Special Director Rakesh Asthana.In a tweet Gandhi said, "A crime thriller titled 'chowkidar is thief' is playing out in Delhi. In the new episode, a CBI DIG has levelled serious charges against a Minister, the NSA, Law Secretary and Cabinet Secretary.""On the other hand, his partner from Gujarat is busy collecting crores. Officers are tired, trust is broken and democracy is crying," he added.The Minister and the Law Secretary had denied any wrongdoing and described the allegations as baseless. The CVC did not find it appropriate to comment as the case was before Supreme Court while there was no comment from Doval so far.On Monday, Congress demanded an independent probe into the corruption allegations made by Sinha, saying they have raised questions on the functioning of Prime Minister's Office and the Modi government. It also said the party MPs would raise the issue in Parliament.Yechury tweeted on Tuesday, "NSA's name has now surfaced in connection with the CBI fiasco and earlier as the lead negotiator in the corrupt Rafale deal. Is there still any doubt that the strings of the deals do not stop at the NSA but lead directly to his boss?"Earlier he said, "the NSA, CVC, Cabinet Secretary, MoS close to Modi, Law Secretary and other higher-ups ganged up to protect the corrupt and criminal by trying to subvert the CBI? There must be a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry into this."Yadav tweeted, "Very very unfortunate that credibility of these institutions built in number of years being lost...One more officer of CBI jumped into the war who has alleged role of high functionaries in the government. Never seen in the past destroying of the credible institutions by the government in the country.It is unfortunate and will be very difficult for the next government at Centre to correct and restore credibility."
