During the investigation, it also found the involvement of another 82 officials who had colluded in running the syndicate from the prison.Chandrashekhar, who is currently in Mandoli jail here, is accused of cheating many people, including high-profile individuals such as former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh's wife Aditi Singh of Rs 200 crore.
