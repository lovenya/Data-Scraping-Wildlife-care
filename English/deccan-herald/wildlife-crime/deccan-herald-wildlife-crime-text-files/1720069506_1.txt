This approach will help the peacocks access essential resources, without being exposed to sunlight directly, thereby mitigating their vulnerability to heat stress," the official added.The department has dispatched samples for virology tests to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, aiming at ascertaining any underlying viral causes contributing to the peacock deaths.Post-mortem examinations have already commenced and the reports are awaited.
