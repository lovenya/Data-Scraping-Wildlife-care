The suicide case of ex-serviceman Ram Kishan Grewal which triggered a political row has been handed over to the Crime Branch of Delhi Police, considering "the sensitivity of the matter".

ADVERTISEMENTSpecial Commissioner of Police (Crime) Taj Hassan confirmed the development and said the Crime Branch has initiated inquest proceedings in the case.

The 70-year-old ex-serviceman from Haryana's Bhiwani district consumed poison in the lawns behind Jawahar Bhavan, which houses some offices of the Ministry of External Affairs, on November 1. He was rushed to RML Hospital where he died later.

Grewal's suicide had yesterday snowballed into a huge political showdown in the capital with Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi being detained twice by Delhi Police amid high drama and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also being detained by the policemen.

"The case has been transferred from New Delhi district to Crime Branch keeping in mind the sensitivity of the matter. District police, especially the New Delhi district police, is usually busy with law and order duties. The New Delhi district is a sensitive area since it houses the residences of MPs and important landmarks," said another senior police officer.

Grewal, along with three of his companions, had come to the city apparently to submit a memorandum to the Defence Ministry over the issue of OROP.
