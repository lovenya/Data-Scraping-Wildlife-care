Movies and media should not glorify horrifying crimes, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said on Tuesday as Congress MP Kumari Selja raised the issue of rising crime against women.ADVERTISEMENTAs Selja expressed concern over the way media is treating certain crime reports, Naidu said the media, cinema and off late, social media also have a greater responsibility in "not glorifying these horrifying incidents and showing those people as if they have done something great"."This is also adding to the problem. I hope everyone concerned would keep that in mind, including the media, the cinema and the social media people also," Naidu said.During her Zero Hour intervention, Selja said one has to keep a watch on how things are being used in media and the kind of things that are posted on websites, those are wrong."What all people are watching on the mobile, we should see. The government should take it seriously. This is also a contributory factor. The way woman are being depicted, they way they are glamourised, the way they are glorified and this inspires criminals," she said.
