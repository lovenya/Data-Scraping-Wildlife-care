Though the port is situated at a considerable distance from the outer periphery of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, lions visit this area at regular intervals, as per officials.The state forest department has erected fences along the track at regular intervals to save the lions from getting hit by trains.In the recent past, the Gujarat High Court, while hearing a suo motu PIL over the death of Asiatic lions due to unnatural causes, had asked the state government and Railways to take concrete steps to save lions from getting hit by the trains.As per the last census conducted in June 2020, Gujarat is home to 674 Asiatic lions.
