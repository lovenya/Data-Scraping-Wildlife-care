Netflix's India Original series "Delhi Crime", helmed by Indian-Canadian director Richie Mehta, has bagged the best drama series honour at the 48th International Emmy Awards.ADVERTISEMENTTold from the perspective of the Delhi Police team investigating the crime that made global headlines, the series deconstructs the case of the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who was abducted and gangraped in a moving bus on the night of December 16, 2012 before she was abandoned on a Delhi road.Her injuries were so grievous that she died in a Singapore hospital a fortnight later.Mehta, in his acceptance speech during the virtual ceremony on Monday, dedicated the honour to all the women who not just endure violence that men inflict on them, "but are also tasked to solve the problem."In a statement later, the director said the award is the collective victory of the cast and crew who worked tirelessly to make the show a reality."I never anticipated getting here - it's the culmination of years of work by hundreds of people, sometimes in total isolation and defiance."'Delhi Crime' is a complete labour of love, born out of sadness, anger, frustration, and ultimately, compassion. The entire team from start to finish should take a bow for giving their all to this vision," Mehta said.The series featured actor Shefali Shah as Vartika Chaturvedi, whose character on "Delhi Crime" was based on former Delhi Police DCP Chaya Sharma who cracked the case of the brutal gang-rape within 72 hours.Shah, who was watching the ceremony live, celebrated the show's win in a post on Instagram."And just like that we made history. So so so proud of DC," she posted alongside the show's poster."Delhi Crime", released in 2019, received massive acclaim for its sensitive retelling of a horrific crime that shook the entire nation.Performances by its ensemble cast, including Shah, Rasika Dugal, Adil Hussain and Rajesh Tailang were particularly appreciated by the critics.Dugal, who played idealistic police officer Neeti Singh in the series, said she is particularly happy for Mehta."He's put in so many years of hard work and he had immersed himself in the project in such a special way. I have such deep respect and admiration for him. I'm so happy for him and so grateful that his work has been acknowledged," she told PTI.Hussain and Tailang took to Twitter and congratulated the entire team for the win."Delhi Crime wins the Emmy International Awards for Best Drama.
