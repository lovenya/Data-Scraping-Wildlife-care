Earlier, he visited the house of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to offer condoles on the demise of his father Shrikrishna Birla."At least 4,35,000 cases, including 3,05,000 cases under sections of IPC, were lodged in the state in last 20 months."Over 10 per cent of them were heinous crimes, and crimes against women shot up 14.8 per cent," Punia said."The government has lost the trust of the people. Gehlot has failed to ensure the safety of the daughters of the state and has proved to be a bad father," he said.
