So, we identified these numbers, verified it and got them blocked immediately," he said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Command Centre) Ravindra Gadadi said a single SIM card can be used by a fraudster to cheat many innocent people. So even if that single SIM card gets blocked immediately, then he can't reuse the same SIM to target other victims. This way it helps in reducing the number of victims and also brings down the number of cases.It's an ongoing drive and as and when we identify such suspicious numbers, we will get such SIM cards blocked, he noted. The police are also analysing case files of previous years to identify more such SIM cards which were used for carrying out fraudulent activities so that they could get them blocked too if still in use for the same purpose.
