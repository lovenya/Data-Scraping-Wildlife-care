Cyber crimes witnessed a 69 per cent increase last year with the maximum cases registered under the now-repealed Section 66A of IT Act, which was accused of curbing the spirit of right to free speech.

ADVERTISEMENTPolice registered 9,622 cases of cyber crime in 2014 as against 5,693 in 2013 with Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka together accounting for 48.18 per cent of the cases across the country, the ‘Crime in India 2014’ report published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said.

While Maharashtra topped the list with 1,879 cases, a 107.2 per cent rise from 907 cases the previous year, Uttar Pradesh which came second with 1,737 cases, registered a 154.7 per cent hike from the previous year's figure of 682. Karnataka, the Silicon Valley of India, witnessed 91.4 per cent rise in cyber crime cases from 533 in 2013 to 10,20 last year.

The increase in cases was also reflected in the number of arrests, which reported a 74.3 per cent rise from 3,301 to 5,752. The report showed that the maximum number of cyber crimes were related to Section 66A, which was declared void by Supreme Court in March this year. A total of 4,192 cases or 44 per cent of cyber crimes were registered under this section in UP (898) and Karnataka (603). UP (371) and Karnataka (375) again topped in cases involving publication of obscene or sexually explicit material. Assam registered 377 cases.
