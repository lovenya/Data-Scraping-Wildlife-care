Enforcement Directorate sleuths along with Crime Branch officials on Thursday conducted a series of raids on several premises owned by former chief minister Digambar Kamat and his close relatives in connection with the Louis Berger bribery case.

ADVERTISEMENTThe raids began early Thursday morning at Kamat's residence in Margao, 35 kms from the state capital, his office premises in the city as well as the residential and business premises of his close relative in Panaji.

Two weeks ago, ED had filed a Enforcement Case Information Report under the Prevention of Money Launching act in connection with the Louis Berger international bribery scam, after it was revealed that the money for the bribes was routed through the hawala channel.

An alleged hawala dealer Raichand Soni was also arrested by the Crime Branch in connection with the bribery case in which two former chief ministers, including Kamat and officials are in the dock.
