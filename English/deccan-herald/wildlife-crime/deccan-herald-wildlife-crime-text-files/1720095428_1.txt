Commenting on the low recovery rate, Krishna said that they face three major challenges in getting back the money — late reporting of the crime, mule accounts, and late response from the financial institutions.Krishna said, “Victims usually report the crime late and in addition the average response time of banks is six days. The mule accounts create a layer to the crime and make it even harder to keep track of the money, hence we have such a low return rate.”Speaking specifically about Karnataka, Krishna said that there has been a 183% rise in cyber crimes in the last two years.
