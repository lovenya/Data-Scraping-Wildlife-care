In a 3-hour-long operation, Wildlife SOS and the Maharashtra Forest Department, successfully rescued a Golden jackal from a 25-feet-deep open, dry well in Waghale village, located in the Junnar Range of Pune. ADVERTISEMENTThe jackal was later released back into its natural habitat.The rescue mission was initiated after a distressed farmer placed a rescue call to the forest department, which promptly reached out to Wildlife SOS for assistance.Initially, the team attempted to lure the jackal into a cage placed inside the well. However, the frightened jackal was hesitant to enter the cage.
