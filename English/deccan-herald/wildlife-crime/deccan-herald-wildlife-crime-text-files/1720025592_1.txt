"But as is clear, the prosecutrix and her mother did not support the prosecution case and turned hostile, there is nothing on record to establish the allegations as mentioned in the complaint," she said.Hence, none of the allegations can be held to have been proved against the accused, the court said, while acquitting him of all charges in the case.
