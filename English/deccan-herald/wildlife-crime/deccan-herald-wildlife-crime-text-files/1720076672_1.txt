In an apparent U-turn, a top RSS functionary today said homosexuality is a "socially immoral act" which needs to be treated as a psychological case and demanded a ban on gay marriages.

ADVERTISEMENTA day after he had said that homosexuality is not a crime, RSS joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale made a series of tweets clarifying that it does not mean that it should be glorified.

"Homosexuality is not a crime, but socially immoral act in our society. No need to punish, but to be treated as a psychological case," he said on twitter.

He further said, "Approach to Homosexuality should be 'no criminalisation; no glorification either'. Gay marriage is Institutionalization of homosexuality. It should be prohibited."

Yesterday while participating at an event, Hosabale, when asked whether homosexuality was a crime as considered under Section 377 IPC, had said, "I don't think homosexuality should be considered a criminal offence as long as it does not affect the lives of others in society."

He had also said, "sexual preferences are private and personal. Why should RSS express its views in a public forum? RSS has no view on that. It is for people to have their way. Personal preference of sex is not discussed in RSS and we don't even want to discuss that."

Section 377 of Indian Penal Code terms homosexuality as unnatural and a criminal offence with a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail.

Going by the global trends in this regard, there have been demands within the country to decriminalise homosexuality.

Some BJP leaders have supported such demands for legalising gay marriages. Congress MP and former Minister Shashi Tharoor last week failed to introduce in Lok Sabha a private member's bill to decriminalize homosexuality after members opposed the move.
