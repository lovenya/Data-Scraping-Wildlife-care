The situation in UP has worsened in the last four years. Uttar Pradesh is at the number one spot in terms of farmer suicides and crime against women,” Lallu said.The state unit of the CPI (M-L), in a statement, said during the four years of the Yogi government, maximum damage has been done to civil liberties and constitutional democracy in the state.CPI (M-L) state secretary Sudhakar Yadav said, "The Yogi government has made the entire state an encounter state by considering every encounter as its achievement”.
