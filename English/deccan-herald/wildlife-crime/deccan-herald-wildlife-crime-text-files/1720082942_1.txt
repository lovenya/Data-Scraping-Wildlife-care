A panchayat in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district, about 400 kilometres from here, has come out with a bizarre formula to control crime in its village.
 
The crime control formula of the panchayat in Madora village in the district essentially comprised imposition of monetary penalty on the offenders. What constituted an offense would off course be decided by the panchayat. 
 
As per the formula a fine of Rs. 21 thousand would be imposed on the girl, if she was found to be speaking to someone on her cell phone while walking in the lanes of the village. ''It will help check crimes against women,'' said a panchayat member.
 
Those guilty of slaughtering cow would have to cough up a fine of rs. two lakh while any one, who was found selling liquor, would have to pay rs. 1.11 lakh as fine, reports said.
 
Fines would also be imposed on those roaming in the lanes of the village in inebriated condition or if they committed fraud with someone.
 
A fine of rs. 51 thousand would be imposed on those, who did not heed the advice of the senior members of the panchayat or a reputed person. The panchayat has, however, not defined a reputed person.
 
Village pradhan (chief) Usman said that five committees had been formed in the village to control crimes of different nature. There would be a high powered committee over and above the five committees and its decision would be final.
 
''If the committees and the super committee failed to rein in the offenders then police would be informed,'' Usman said.
 
The 'pradhan' said that the decisions had been taken unanimously in a meeting of the members a couple of days back and expressed confidence that the measures would help check crime in the village.
 
''We hope others will follow us if we succeed,'' he added.ADVERTISEMENT
