Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vasundhara Raje on July 04 in Udaipur, slammed the Ashok Gehlot government over the increasing crime situation in Rajasthan. ADVERTISEMENT“Such a condemnable act, I didn't get to see it in my time. Ashok Gehlot, who is Chief Minister as well as Home Minister of the state has failed completely. In the last 4 years, the crime situation has worsened in the state,” the BJP leader said. “If we cannot provide protection to our people, we have no right to stay in government. They (state government) are only busy in politics, protecting their MLAs, capturing them in hotels,” she added.
