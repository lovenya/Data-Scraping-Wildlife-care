It led Judge Rhys Rowlands to order him to pay the sum of GBP 78,033.Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett told the court that the defendant created false invoices for work apparently charged to his employers."The invoices were then paid out via the company but in fact the company was not going to pay genuine suppliers but it was going to the defendant's bank account. This amount totalled a little over GBP 64,000," he said.The court heard that Gaglani told the company's director, Matthew Porter, that he was in a civil dispute with his former employers. Porter loaned him money to help him pay off his debts, which it turned out he used to try and clear up his previous fraud.
