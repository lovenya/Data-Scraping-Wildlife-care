The Karnataka Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday renewed their partnership for Cyber Crime Investigation Training and Research, located in Bengaluru, (CCITR) with their collaborators for four more years. ADVERTISEMENTIn 2018, the CID signed a MoU with the Infosys Foundation and the Data Security Council of India (DSCI) to set up the CCITR. The collaboration has been renewed for another four years to strengthen the cybercrime investigation capabilities of the Karnataka police. The Infosys Foundation has announced a four-year grant of Rs 33 crore for the same purpose. For the last six years, hundreds of investigators have received cybercrime investigation training through the 
CCITR. This vital collaboration has emerged as the best training ground for cybercrime investigators. Further, it aspires to perform research in digital forensics and foster entrepreneurship for the development of indigenous cyber forensics products and solutions. Also Read:AWAKE empowers women with car driving training Also Read:AWAKE empowers women with car driving training Speaking about the collaboration, M A Saleem, Director General of Police, CID, Economic Offences, and Special Units, said, “The strategic initiatives for capacity enhancement undertaken by the Criminal Investigation Department of Karnataka have been substantially bolstered by the collaborative efforts with the Infosys Foundation and the Data Security Council of India.” “In addition to training police officers, CCITR has also extended its activities to other stakeholders in the criminal justice delivery system, namely, the prosecution and judiciary. With the renewal of the collaboration, we expect more thought leadership in digital forensics that would improve the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime cases,” said the top cop.
