Speaking at a State University foundation stone laying ceremony in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on November 13 said that no one has the courage to commit crime in his government's regime irrespective of previous years. “In 2007, there was an attack on me in Azamgarh. Ajit Rai, a ABVP member was killed inside Shibli National College for demanding to recite 'Vande Mataram' during Republic Day and FIR wasn't registered for a month after the incident. Today, no one can commit such acts,” said CM Yogi.ADVERTISEMENT
