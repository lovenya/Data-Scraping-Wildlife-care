According to newspaper The Press, the introduction of speakers playing Mozart and other classical music in a mall in Christchurch in June 2009 has led to a steep fall in petty crime, the mall's managers said.

Figures reveal the number of anti-social incidents attended by security guards came down from 77 a week in October 2008 to only two per week in October this year and the number of drug and alcohol-related incidents fell from 16 to zero. 

The number of times the guards helped shopkeepers deal with troublesome customers also fell from 35 to zero, the report said. "The music has certainly had an effect during the day. It has created an environment that is conducive to good behaviour," a senior police officer said.ADVERTISEMENT
