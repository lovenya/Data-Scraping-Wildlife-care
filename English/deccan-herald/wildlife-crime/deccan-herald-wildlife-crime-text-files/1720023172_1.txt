A PTI spokesperson termed the use of state machinery against the peaceful protestors as shameful, expressing his surprise that the citizens are being arrested for their sole crime of expressing solidarity and support for the oppressed Palestinians and carrying the PTI flags. He said it is the continuation of the state coercive policy based on political revenge since Khan was ousted from power in April last year."Denying the right of peaceful protests to the most popular party is shameful, reprehensible," he said, lashing out at the authorities for their doubled standards. Since the attack on military installations in different parts of the country by the PTI workers in early May in reaction to the arrest of Khan in a corruption case, the party has not been allowed by the military establishment to take part in any political activity. Over 10,000 PTI workers are reportedly in jail including Imran Khan.
