Still, I was the Chief Minister and also the Home Minister, I understand my responsibility and I have decided to appear before the BKV cyber police station as asked and get my statement recorded,” Fadnavis told a hurriedly-convened news conference on Saturday.With the Budget session of the Maharashtra Legislature currently underway - the development would have its echo on Monday. It may be mentioned, the Maharashtra government had earlier told a Mumbai court that Fadnavis is a witness in the case registered over illegal phone tapping that allegedly took place when IPS officer Rashmi Shukla was Commissioner of the State Intelligence Department.Shukla, an officer of 1988-batch of IPS, is currently on central deputation and posted in Hyderabad as the Additional Director General (South Zone) of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).In August 2020, Shukla drafted a report indicating cash for transfers and promotions in Maharashtra Police which was forwarded by then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal to the then Additional Chief Secretary (home) and later Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte to be shown to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.However, the Chief Minister passed on the report to the then Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and no action was taken.Check out DH's latest videos:
