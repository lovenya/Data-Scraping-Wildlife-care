The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has not only helped to broaden the scope of financial inclusion providing banking services to the remotest corner of the country, but it has also enabled an environment that has reduced the incidence of crime.ADVERTISEMENTAccording to an SBI Ecowrap report, states with higher PMJDY accounts balances have seen a perceptible decline in crime."We also observed that there is both statistically significant and economically meaningful drop in consumption of intoxicants such as alcohol and tobacco products in states where more PMJDY accounts are opened," the report said.Also Read:Jan Dhan initiative forever transformed India's development trajectory, says PM ModiIn India, over the years crimes have been increasing.

As crime data is available till 2020, it took into account 37 states and UTs and 5- years data (2016-2020) to build a panel data model.
