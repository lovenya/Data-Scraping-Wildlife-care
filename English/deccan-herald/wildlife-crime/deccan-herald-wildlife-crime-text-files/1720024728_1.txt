Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday condemned an attack against a mosque in the city of Mississauga in Ontario province, which is being probed as a hate crime and which rights advocates described as being part of a rise in Islamophobia.ADVERTISEMENTPolice said someone threw two rocks through the window of a Mississauga mosque on Sunday, on the eve of the anniversary of a mosque attack in Quebec city that killed six people in 2017.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims said the attack was "part of an alarming rise in Islamophobic hate across the country."In November, authorities in Toronto said the number of antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes in Canada's largest city had spiked significantly since the start of the Gaza conflict.Rights advocates have noted a rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia in many parts of the world since Oct 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel and killed 1,200, according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel has militarily assaulted the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip, killing 27,000, according to Gaza's health ministry, and flattening most of the densely populated enclave where nearly all of the 2.3 million population is displaced.
