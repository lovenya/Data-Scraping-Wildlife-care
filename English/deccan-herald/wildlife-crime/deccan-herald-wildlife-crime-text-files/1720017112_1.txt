As the arguments became heated, the suspect hit the victim on his head with the hammer and when he fell down, he hit him seven to eight times.”At around 6.30 pm, when their parents returned from work, Shivakumar told them he found Pranesh dead in the grove. The Sarjapur police were then informed.“The suspect was the last person to see the victim and the first to discover the body. When the police questioned him, he confessed to the murder,” Mallikarjun Baladandi, superintendent of police, Bengaluru Rural told DH.The family hailed from Adoni in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool district. The boys’ parents and some relatives moved to Bengaluru nearly 20 years ago in search of work. Shivakumar joined them after he dropped out of Class 7, while Pranesh stayed with his grandmother in Adoni for studies and had just finished his Class 7.
