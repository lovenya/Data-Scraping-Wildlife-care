A leopard looking for prey, a deer hopping on the grass, winged beauties flying in all splendour, a scene of cascading waters…

ADVERTISEMENTThe 61st Wildlife Week and Elephant Day was observed by the Forest Department at the Officers’ Club in town on Friday. The painting competition – organised as part of the Wildlife Week – for students from LKG till graduation, witnessed the recreation of a world affixed to Nature.

The paintings of birds, by 30 little artists of LKG and UKG-levels, were visual treats. Birds – in various actions, including sitting on trees, flying, building nests and feeding their young – threw the visitors to the venue in delight.

Thirty-five children in the Class 6 and 7 category drew pictures of deer, while 61 students of Classes 8 and 9 painted pictures of leopards.

Nine undergraduation students depicted the beauty of various famous waterfalls in the Malnad region. Three students captured Nature’s bounty on canvas. There were also pencil sketches, which earned special appreciation from the judges.

One of the judges, R M Kattimani, suggested the Forest Department to bring out the best paintings in the competition in the form of a calendar, to encourage the little artists.

The winners of the competition will be awarded prizes during the valedictory function of the Wildlife Week, which be held on October 8.
