During the procession, a fight broke out between the suspects and Ajith, and both sides threatened each other. "Ajith allegedly stared at the accused while dancing during the procession, provoking them. They confronted Ajith and warned him, only to get a counter-warning from him,” the officer said. The officer noted that after the incident, they all went back without any further exchange of words. However, at 11 pm, when Ajith went to buy alcohol, the suspects waylaid him and attacked him with weapons. The officer said they suspected the involvement of five more people and were planning to detain them for questioning.
