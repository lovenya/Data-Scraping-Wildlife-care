Speaking on newly-elected Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Tirath Singh Rawat’s controversial comments on wearing ripped jeans, Samajwadi Party leader and MP Jaya Bachchan on Thursday said it’s a bad mindset and encourages crimes against women. “Such statements don't befit a CM. Those on higher posts must think & make public statements. You say such things in today's times, you'll decide who's cultured & who's not based on clothes! It's bad mindset & encourages crimes against women,” Jaya told ANI. Rawat had earlier made a controversial statement and said, “Women wearing ripped jeans can’t provide right environment at home for children.”ADVERTISEMENT
