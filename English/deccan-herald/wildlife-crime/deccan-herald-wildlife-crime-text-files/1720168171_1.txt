This is illegal as only police officers not below the rank of a sub-inspector in Bengaluru are allowed to check vehicles for appropriate documentation. "We verified the claims about his actions. Accordingly, I suspended him pending departmental inquiry. We will see what further action needs to be taken based on the inquiry report," Anita added. Additionally, the Bengaluru Traffic Police (BTP) have been instructed to stop random physical checks of vehicles unless there is a special drive taken up for cases such as drink-driving or wrong-side driving.
