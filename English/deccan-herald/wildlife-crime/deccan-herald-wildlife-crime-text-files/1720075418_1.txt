The Kerala High Court on Friday will hear two pleas seeking release of two wild elephants and five tigers captured from Palakkad and Wayanad districts of the state and presently kept in captivity by the Forest department.ADVERTISEMENTThe petitions, listed before Justice Shaji P Chaly, have claimed that the captivity of the two tuskers -- PT 7 and PM 2 -- and the tigers was illegal as it was in violation of the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.The petitioners, Angels Nair -- general secretary of NGO Animal Legal Force Integration -- and Mini Sudhil -- who claims to be an animal welfare enthusiast, have contended that the two tuskers are being subjected to harsh and rigorous training to tame them into becoming 'kumki' elephants.Also Read | Kerala: Locals protest against court's stay on capturing wild elephant'Kumki' elephants are captive pachyderms used in operations for trapping and capturing other elephants.
