Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Friday said the relationship between illicit trade, organised crime and terrorism poses a clear and present danger to global security and made a strong pitch to dismantle the networks that seek to undermine the country's security and prosperity.ADVERTISEMENTAddressing the MASCRADE 2023 conference organised by FICCI, Thakur said the surge in illicit trade is a troubling consequence of globalisation that casts a shadow on India's progress towards achieving the goal of a $5 trillion economy.'Illicit trade, whether conducted through activities like smuggling, counterfeiting or tax evasion, exacts a considerable socio-economic toll. It not only hinders our advancement but also drives up expenses, pushing these crucial goals even further from our reach,' he said.Also Read:Anurag Thakur slams Rajasthan government over cases of crimes against womenAlso Read:Anurag Thakur slams Rajasthan government over cases of crimes against women'Let us join hands in this vital endeavour, working together to dismantle the networks that seek to undermine our security and prosperity.
