India-born Rutgers student Dharun Ravi was today found guilty by a US court of hate crime and invasion of privacy for spying on his roommate's gay sexual encounter with another man in 2010.

ADVERTISEMENTThe sentencing of 20-year old Ravi, who was convicted of hate crime, invasion of privacy for spying on Tyler Clementi, has been set for May 21.

Ravi faces 10 years in prison or possible deportation to India for invading the privacy of Clementi when he used a webcam to watch him kiss another man on September 19, 2010.

Ravi had then sent text messages to some of his other friends inviting them to watch the sexual encounter.

Clementi committed suicide by jumping off the bridge linking New York City and New Jersey just days after the webcam footage became public in September 2010.

The verdict by the New Jersey court was announced by jurors comprising five men and seven women aged between 20 to 70 years who deliberated for a total of about 11 hours over the last three days.

The case generated immense international interest as it threw light on issues of cyber-bullying and treatment of young gays and lesbians.
