Rests are sub-adults and cubs.Since Ranthambore is rich in habitat and prey base, the number of tigers is higher there, another official said.Also Read: Assam re-opens national parks, sanctuaries with focus on domestic touristsIn the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar, the number of tigers is 27 – nine male, 11 female and seven cubs. The Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve (Kota) has one tigress, and the Ramgarh Vishdhari (Bundi) has one tiger and one tigress.The RTR field director said the dispersal of adult tigers is increasing, particularly those who do not have a territory, which is nearly a dozen, and most of such big cats are in the periphery area.Shrinking areas increase the possibility of territorial fights as well as human-animal conflicts."The population of tigers is rising in Ranthambore and they need space. This is one of the reasons behind relocation of big cats from there," another official of the forest department said.Over a dozen tigers in Ranthambore (aged between 3-5 years) are under special monitoring as they do not have their own territories and are moving in the periphery.The department is monitoring their movement and has accordingly placed camera traps.
