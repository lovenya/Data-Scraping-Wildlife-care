Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday condemned the indiscriminate bombing on the hospital in Gaza and residential areas, calling it "unjustifiable and a grave humanitarian tragedy" for which the perpetrators must be held accountable.ADVERTISEMENTFormer party chief Rahul Gandhi too joined in condemning the "killing of thousands of innocent civilians, including children in Gaza" and the "collective punishment of millions" of people by cutting off their food, water and electricity. He called it "crimes against humanity" while also condemning Hamas' killing of innocent Israelis and taking hostages.Also Read:Crypto is a small slice of Hamas’ funding— but it’s deadlyAlso Read:Crypto is a small slice of Hamas’ funding— but it’s deadlyIn a statement, Kharge said the party repeats its call for an immediate cease-fire and for humanitarian assistance to the beleaguered people of Gaza and urged all sides to abandon the path of "senseless violence and war" and begin the process of negotiations and diplomacy so that the aspirations of the Palestinian people are fulfilled and the security concerns of Israel are also ensured.Recalling that on October 8, the Congress had condemned the brutal attacks by Hamas on the people of Israel, he said, "also unacceptable are the indiscriminate actions by Israel’s military forces in civilian areas, that includes a siege of the Gaza Strip and bombings in it."The Congress "reiterates its long-standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people. The aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of dignity, self-respect and equality in a sovereign state of their own is long-standing and perfectly legitimate. These aspirations have been routinely suppressed and denied. Millions of Palestinians have been dispossessed and displaced. They have lived in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation", he said.In a post on 'X', Rahul said that the killing of thousands of innocent civilians, including children in Gaza and the collective punishment of millions of people by cutting off their food, water and electricity are "crimes against humanity".

"Hamas' killing of innocent Israelis and taking hostages is a crime and must also be condemned. The cycle of violence between Israel and Palestine must be brought to an end," he said.The October 8 statement had not gone well with a section of the Congress leaders, who suggested that the party has not unequivocally pledged its support to Palestinian people that echoes Congress' original stand. A subsequent resolution by the Congress Working Committee sought to forcefully reflect the commitment to Palestinian cause.
