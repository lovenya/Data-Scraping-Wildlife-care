He often observes how Deepika Padukone (in films) dresses. Maximum atrocities against women and tribals are taking place in Madhya Pradesh. So, it would be better if the home minister runs his state first," Kumar said.Also Read | BJP forms 26-member election panel for upcoming Madhya Pradesh Assembly pollsKumar, former president of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students' union, also attacked the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government's flagship 'Ladli Behna' scheme, under which women fulfilling certain criteria are given Rs 1,000 per month."BJP leaders are saying this amount would be increased. They should keep this amount with themselves and tells us why a gas cylinder costing Rs 350 is sold at Rs 1,400," he alleged.CM Chouhan recently said the aid under the Ladli Behna scheme would be increased to Rs 3,000 per month soon.Attacking right-wing organizations, Kumar claimed that in order to change the basic identity of the tribals, efforts were being made to describe them as "forest dwellers"."If those living in forests are forest dwellers, then should people living in flats be called flat dwellers," he quipped.
