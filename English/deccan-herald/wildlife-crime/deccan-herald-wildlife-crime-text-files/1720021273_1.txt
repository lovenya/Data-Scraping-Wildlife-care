Our probe found that he is a B.Com. degree holder. When asked about his claims of being a scientist, he said he was a freelancer who had worked on Chandrayaan-3's design at ISRO's Bengaluru office. He even claims to be working with NASA," said the official."As per our preliminary probe, he is not an ISRO scientist. Further probe will be carried out by the crime branch and a First Information Report will be registered against him if he is found to be lying," she added.
