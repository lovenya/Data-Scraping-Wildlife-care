The Assam Forest Department stated on Monday that the Saturday night jeep safari of Sadhguru of Isha Foundation, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and others, inside Kaziranga National Park was not in violation of rules, as they were the department’s invited guests.ADVERTISEMENT“In the Wildlife Protection Act, there are provisions under which the chief wildlife warden can allow someone to visit the park. There is no question of day or night. We had invited Sadhguru, our CM and other officials to visit the park and so the jeep safari was done as per the provision,” Assam’s Chief Wildlife warden M K Yadava told local television channels in Assam on Monday.Also Read | Complaint against Sadhguru, Assam CM for jeep safari in Kaziranga National ParkYadava made the clarification a day after two activists, living near Kaziranga, had lodged a police complaint alleging that the jeep safari inside the park at night was in violation of the provisions of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and sought police action.The chief wildlife warden was also quick to point out this advantage was not for common tourists. “Don’t make the comparison between tourists and our guests.
