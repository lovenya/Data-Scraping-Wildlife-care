RJD Leader Tejashwi Yadav on November 30 slammed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after liquor bottles were recovered from the State Assembly. While addressing mediapersons, he said, “Where did the bottle of liquor come from inside the Bihar Vidhan Sabha? The Chief Minister should inspect himself. We have seen the picture of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar with the liquor mafia. Nitish Kumar's ministers are free to commit crimes. The CM should give his resignation and apologize to the people of Bihar.”ADVERTISEMENT
