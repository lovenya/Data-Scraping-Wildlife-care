One person was killed and five others were injured on Monday in a clash between alleged encroachers and forest guards at the Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary in Sonitpur district of Assam, officials said.ADVERTISEMENTNagaon Wildlife Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Jayanta Deka said that alleged encroachers, who were earlier evicted from the forest, have been trying to occupy land again inside the Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary over the past few days."Today, around 800-900 people armed with machetes, sticks and other sharp objects came to encroach the land. Our people tried to convince them not to do so, but they instead attacked the forest guards," he told PTI.Also Read | Flood situation in Assam remains grim, around 1 lakh affectedAt least three forest guards were injured in the attack by the villagers, who came from various areas of neighbouring Nagaon district on the southern bank of Brahmaputra, Deka said."In self-defence, the forest guards fired in the air to disperse the mob.
