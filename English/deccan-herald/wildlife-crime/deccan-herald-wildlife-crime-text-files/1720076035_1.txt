The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is contemplating opening a cyber crime investigation branch in Mumbai and is in talks with the Maharashtra Government to work out the modalities.   

ADVERTISEMENT“The economic offences and cyber crimes are on the increase,  and Mumbai being the commercial and financial capital of India is an appropriate place to have a cyber investigation facility," CBI Director Anil Singh said speaking to mediapersons  after opening the new CBI office at the Bandra-Kurla Complex here. 

“CBI has investigated over 20 cyber-related cases, but presently the facility is centralised in New Delhi. We are in talks with the Maharashtra Government and the Maharashtra Police to work out the nitty gritties” he added.

Sinha said that though CBI started as an anti-corruption agency, its scope has increased over the last few decades to economic offences, serious frauds and sensational cases under the IPC.  

“CBI is now a federal investigative agency that can investigate most of the offences which affect public life in general and which have a direct bearing on the quality of life of the common man”, he added.
