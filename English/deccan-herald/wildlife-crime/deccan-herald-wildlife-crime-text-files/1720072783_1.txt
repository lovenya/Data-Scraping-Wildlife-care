It is recognised as  one of the important  satellite wetlands for the pink birds. Flamingos come to this wetland when the water level rises during high tide at the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS). Flamingos are comfortable only in 15 cm to 18 cm of water.Kumar has complained to the CM that the tidal water inlets to the DPS Flamingo Lake are choked. In fact, the main inlet from the creek on the southern end of the lake has been buried with the road construction for the unused Nerul jetty.He recalled that the NMMC itself was keen to conserve the wetland as a flamingo abode and tourist attraction and even roped in BNHS for the project. But CIDCO has so far refused to hand over the work to NMMC.CIDCO has transferred about 25 lakes to the civic body but retained the DPS Flamingo Lake, NRI and TS Chanakya wetlands with it. CIDCO has in fact marked the wetland at Sector 52 of Nerul for “future development”.Rekha Sankhala of Save Flamingos and Mangroves forum said vested interests are to blame for the burial of water inlets at DPS Flamingo Lake.
