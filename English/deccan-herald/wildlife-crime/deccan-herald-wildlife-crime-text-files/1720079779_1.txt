An Asian Palm Civet was rescued from a house in Delhi Cantt area by a team of Wildlife SOS.

ADVERTISEMENTOn Monday, three Civet cats found their way into the house of Ambar Bagga, a resident of Arjan Vihar in Delhi Cantt.

Bagga’s children were home alone when they saw the three animals wandering around the house, nibbling fruits placed on the dining table. Scared and confused, they called their parents, who upon arrival managed to chase away two of the civets. Unfortunately, the last one had managed to make its way into their kitchen loft.

 “We rushed back home to help our kids and were able to chase away two of them but the third civet had taken shelter at our loft,” said Bagga, a Commander in the Indian Navy.
The family tried various methods to get it out safely, but the terrified animal refused to leave the loft for the next two days.

“We didn’t want to cause the animal any harm so we let it remain there till we found someone who could help us out,” he said. He called the Wildlife SOS helpline number, following which a two-member team rescued the animal.

“The Asian Palm Civet, also called a toddy cat, is a small mammal that can survive in a wide range of habitats. They can are seen in urban environments, but quite rarely, as it tends to be shy and wary of humans,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder of Wildlife SOS.

The organisation runs the only 24-hour ‘Animal Rescue Cell’ in the NCR.
“Delhi still has a few patches of forest that are home to such unique wildlife and it is essential that we remain sensitive to the presence of wild animals here,” said Geeta Seshamani, co-founder of Wildlife SOS. 

The animal is currently under observation in the Wildlife SOS rescue facility in Gurgaon and will soon be released into the wild, a statement by the organisation said.
