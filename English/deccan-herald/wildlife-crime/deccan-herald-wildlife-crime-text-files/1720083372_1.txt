Reporting crime is now a click away with the government on Monday launching the national criminal tracking system with new facilities.

The launch of digital police portal — www.digitalpolice.gov.in — under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS) — a work in progress since 2009 — by Home Minister Rajnath Singh could also see the speeding up of passport verification process.

In the portal, citizens can lodge a complaint or request for person and address verification of employees, tenants and nurses among others, and also seek permission for hosting public events.

Besides, the portal will enable restricted access to law enforcement agencies on topics such as antecedent verification and make assessment of FIRs.

Launching the portal, Singh said the Interoperable Criminal Justice System will be a useful resource for all stakeholders, including the policy makers.

Elaborating on the plans, Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi said a victim or a witness can report a crime online and this information will reach the police station concerned within seconds. Another service available is person verification, such as tenant or domestic help verification. However, this is subject to consent of the person being verified.
