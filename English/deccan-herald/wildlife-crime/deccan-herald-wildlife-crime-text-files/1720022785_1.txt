While asking all stakeholders to represent the panel if there are any grievances, the NGT said that the committee may meet within two weeks to take stock of the situation and plan a further course of action. The Committee may thereafter meet at least once in a month or at such earlier intervals as found necessary.

Upholding the forest clearance given to the project, the Green Bench said that the Delhi Dehradun Highway including NH-72A is an important highway connecting Delhi, Haryana and Western UP to Dehradun and higher reaches of Himalayas through Dehradun.

The bench said that the travel time between the two cities on the existing Highway (NH-72A) currently is 6-7 hours in the Non-Peak Hours and more than 8 hours during the Peak Hours.

"Longer Travel time of vehicles in forest zones means a longer time of disturbance to wildlife also. Another major reason necessitating the development of the project site is the poor geometrics of the existing road which leads to the occurrence of road accidents in this stretch," the bench said.The NGT said that the committee should monitor including cordoning of elevated roads and other ecological sensitive stretches with proper barriers to absorb light and noise, fitting of cameras at strategic locations to monitor the protection of wildlife movement and their habitats, a mechanism for rescuing animals in case of any accidents, awareness for care and protection of wildlife.Watch the latest DH Videos here:
