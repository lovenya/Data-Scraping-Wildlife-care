After series of killings took place across Bihar, particularly three murders in the Patna and adjoining districts in the last 24 hours, the BJP on Thursday asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to adopt Uttar Pradesh’s ‘encounter model’.ADVERTISEMENT“There is no way out other than to adopt the UP’s ‘encounter model’ if one has to check crime in Bihar which, of late, has shot up. Vehicles need to be ‘overturned' to keep the morale of the police high,” said BJP MLA Pawan Jaiswal.By using the term ‘overturn’, the BJP legislator was referring to the incident related to Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey whose vehicle ‘overturned’ before he was shot dead in an encounter by the UP cops.The BJP’s reaction in Bihar comes close on the heels of the killing of a woman in Patna when she protested the molestation of her daughter. In another incident, a LIC official was beaten to death in Nalanda. Besides, a ward councillor was killed in Saran. Apart from these incidents, two sisters were shot at in Bhojpur in the last 24 hours.“The time has come to give a free hand to the Bihar police. They should adopt the UP model, as criminals are punished in the neighbouring state on the spot,” opined another BJP MLA Vinay Bihari.JD (U) was not impressed with the BJP leaders’ assertions. “Staged encounters often lead to human rights issue,” said Ashok Choudhary, a senior JD (U) minister and key aide of Nitish.“We are aware of the rise in crime incidents. And we are taking all possible steps to stem the rot. Those who are committing crimes will be apprehended and punished as per the law of the land,” the minister added.
