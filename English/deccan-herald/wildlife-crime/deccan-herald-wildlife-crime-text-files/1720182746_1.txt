With schemes like Digital India encouraging rural and urban population to adopt technology, increasing cyber attacks could impair the country’s economic and financial growth, experts say. 

With much of those attacks targeting businesses and, in some cases, triggered their shutdowns, they say it is vital to protect systems and computer installations. “Cybercrime is now a burning issue all over the world and has impacted several businesses,” Dr Daehoon Kim, CEO, IriTech, Inc, USA, said. 

A recent KPMG survey titled “Cybercrime Survey 2015” said over 72 per cent of the 250 top Indian companies reported experiencing cyberattacks in the past one year that could compromise with the overall economic growth.

“Not just that, 64 per cent of those in the positions of directors/manager along with the general staff are prone to cybercrime,” Lalit Mahadeshwar, President, Sateri System, pointed out.  Sateri System’s security product CCure, he said, secures personal computers and smartphones are unharmed by cyber attacks and suffer loss of important data.
