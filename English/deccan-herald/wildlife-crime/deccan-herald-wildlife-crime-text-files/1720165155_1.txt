The recent rape and spate of chain snatching incidents across the City prompted Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to take officials of Home, Police and allied departments to task on Wednesday. 

ADVERTISEMENTHe warned the officials of stringent action if they failed to curb the crimes.
The Chief Minister’s warning came during a review meeting with officials of the Home Department, senior police officers and other officials from allied departments on Wednesday.

Sounding a stern warning, Siddaramaiah said, “If there is failure in preventing chain snatching and other crimes in the City, not only the junior police officers will be held responsible but also the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) will face the music. We will not think twice before suspending them if they fail to curb these crimes.”
The chief minister directed the police officers to initiate all possible measures to curb crimes and ensure that no such barbaric incident is repeated.

He said the private companies, including BPOs, call centres and other IT companies are duty bound to provide adequate security to women employees travelling late at night. If they fail to comply, officers concerned should make sure that the firms take the direction seriously.
