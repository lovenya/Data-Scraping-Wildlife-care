Dhami said it was fostering an atmosphere of mistrust among the Sikh community. He also said the Dera chief was repeatedly being granted temporary release from the jail but governments were not listening to the voice raised by the Sikh community for the release of 'Bandi Singhs' (Sikh prisoners). Previously, the Dera chief had walked out of the Sunaria jail on a 30-day parole on July 30. Earlier, the Dera chief had been granted a 40-day parole in January. In October last year too, he was granted a 40-day parole. Prior to his October parole, he had come out of the prison on a month-long parole in June last year. Besides, he was granted a three weeks' furlough from February 7, 2022. In 2021, the Dera chief, along with four others, was also convicted for hatching a conspiracy to kill Ranjit Singh, a Dera manager. The Dera chief and three others were convicted in 2019 for the murder of a journalist more than 16 years ago.
