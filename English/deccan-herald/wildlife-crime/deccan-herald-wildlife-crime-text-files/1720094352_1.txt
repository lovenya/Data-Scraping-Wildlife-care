The victim also identified the accused,” Chavan said.The accused was allegedly staying in the hostel with his wife, which is not allowed as it is a girls' hostel and he is not an employee of the facility which houses 429 girl students, the official said.The investigation also revealed that hostel superintendent Heena (36) allegedly did not report the matter to senior authorities and police at the appropriate time, in view of which more sections of the IPC and POCSO were included in the FIR and she was also arrested, Chavan said.The SP said he and women police officials have spoken to other girl inmates of the school and enquired with them, but no other such complaint has come to the fore.The hostel's superintendent and assistant superintendent have been suspended for allegedly delaying reporting the matter to the police, a district administration official earlier said.Porta cabins are pre-fabricated structure residential schools set up in Left Wing Extremism-affected villages of the state's Bastar division, which includes the Sukma district.The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Chhattisgarh has slammed the ruling Congress over the incident and claimed the law and order situation has collapsed in the state.The BJP has also constituted a probe team of the party leaders, headed by its woman MLA Ranjana Sahu, that visited the residential school on Wednesday.
