The government is embarking on an ambitious Rs 13.35 crore programme to train around 37,500 policemen and judicial officers in cyber crime in the next two years to strengthen the investigation and prosecution mechanism as well as preventing such incidents.ADVERTISEMENTUnder the programme, 27,500 police personnel and 10,000 judicial officers and prosecutors will be trained in the working of cyber domain, modus operandi of cyber criminals, basic understanding of evidence associated with such crimes, legal provisions, cyber crime identification, crime scene management and investigation procedures.Of the 27,500 police personnel, at least 2,500 will be chosen from women station house officers (SHOs) across the country as they would be the first to interact with victims and record their complaints.Of the 17,500 officers, states can add more women police officers for the training programme.A senior Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) official told DH that the programme is being rolled out as the government feels that the understanding on cyber crimes cannot be limited to a few specialist investigative officers, as increasing use of internet and social media has resulted in a "plethora of varied crimes being committed in the cyber domain".The training is part of Cyber Crime Prevention Against Women and Children scheme under Nirbhaya Fund.The unveiling of the training programme comes weeks after the MHA asked states to set up systems to monitor "deep web", which is often used for planning and execution by cyber criminals.Its advisory on cyber crime prevention and control to the states has insisted on the need for gearing up institutional mechanism to tackle cyber crimes, which pose "technical, administrative as well as legal challenges" in investigations.Three training modules have been designed.Two separate three-day programmes have been devised for 17,000 police personnel that includes at least 2,000 police women, who receive complaints, and judicial officers.A five-day programme has been devised for 10,500 above the rank of sub inspector, including at least 500 women, for those investigating these cases.An MHA concept note shared with states said that most of the crimes now have an element of misuse of computers, smartphones and communication networks and these technologies are being used by criminals in committing conventional crimes.There is a need to evaluate electronic evidences for nailing culprits and the training is aimed at enabling investigators to extract legally tenable evidences for securing conviction in courts.
