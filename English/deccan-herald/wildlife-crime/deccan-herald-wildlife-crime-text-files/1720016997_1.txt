Bengaluru: An inebriated car driver mowed down two people on bikes while attempting to flee from an accident that injured a pedestrian in Bengaluru’s eastern outskirts, police officials said. ADVERTISEMENTThe accident occurred at 12.50 am on Thursday on Hoskote-Chintamani Road when the accused was driving towards Hoskote. The accused was identified as Pragatheesh Rao, a resident of Doddahullur near the Satellite Town Ring Road, aged between 25 and 28 years. Hoskote police told DH that Rao was nearly unconscious when he was found, indicating that he had consumed copious amounts of alcohol. Series of crashes The speeding driver first crashed into a pedestrian named Shami, a staff member at the Sri Krishna Sagar restaurant. He suffered a leg fracture as a result of the crash. The accident drew the attention of passersby and residents of the area, who rushed to the spot and reportedly yelled at the driver to get out. A panicking Rao revved the engine and tried to flee from the spot, crashing into two bikes on the road in front of him. Police said that the trio on the first bike fell on the road due to the impact. “All three were residents of Shivajinagar. An 18-year-old named Mohammad Faiz was killed while his friends Mohammad Abuzar and Abbas Pasha, both 18 years old, sustained injuries,” said an officer attached to the Hoskote police station. The other bike rider, Jagadeesh (28), a resident of Kannurahally, also died after the crash. Absconding driverRao also sustained injuries as a result of the multiple crashes.
