Mumbai: Reacting sharply to the Pune hit-and-run incident, Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi  questioned as to why “preferential treatment” was meted out to the 17-year-old son of businessman Vishal Agarwal. ADVERTISEMENTIn a video statement, he said: “…when any autorickshaw drivers and cabbies or Ola or Uber drivers or bus drivers or truckers kill anybody unintentionally, they are dumped in the jail for 10 years and the keys are thrown away. However, when a teenager kid from a rich family consumes alcohol and kills two people in his Porsche, he is told to pen an ‘essay’. Why are the other bus, truck autorickshaw drivers or cabbies not asked to write such essays.” Also Read:Pune Porsche Accident: Devendra Fadnavis says Juvenile Justice Board took lenient view of a heinous crimeAlso Read:Pune Porsche Accident: Devendra Fadnavis says Juvenile Justice Board took lenient view of a heinous crime Gandhi also took a dig at the Prime Minister by saying: “Narendra Modi is creating two Indias - where even justice is dependent on wealth”. “The question is of justice – the poor and the prosperous. All should be entitled to equal justice. That’s why we are fighting. We are fighting for equality of justice and against injustice,” he said.
