"We would like the Sri Lankan Government to take it's responsibility and establish the kind of accountable system that its people can have confidence it," US State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland told reporters at her daily news conference.

"If that does not happen and does not happen expeditiously, then we reserve the right to discuss international mechanisms," Nuland added in response to a question, but did not specify any time line for this.

"Iâ€™m not going to set artificial timelines from this podium, but we understand the frustration and the concern of Sri Lankan people," she said.

"This is Sri Lankan Government's responsibility that we want to see them take on for the good of their own nation," she added.ADVERTISEMENT
