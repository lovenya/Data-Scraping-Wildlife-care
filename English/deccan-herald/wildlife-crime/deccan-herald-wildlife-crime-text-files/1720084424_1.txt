Pressure mounted on Sri Lanka over its rights record as a British channel broadcast a documentary suggesting that slain LTTE chief V Prabhakaran’s 12-year-old son was killed by army after the boy surrendered, prompting Colombo to reject it as “baseless and unacceptable”.

The programme titled ‘Sri Lanka Killing Fields – War Crimes Unpunished’ was aired in the UK last night.

“We have obtained a sworn affidavit from a senior Sri Lankan officer in which he suggests that the boy was apparently interrogated about his father’s whereabouts, and then killed,” a Channel 4 spokeswoman told the BBC. “Evidence that the shooting of the 12-year-old was an execution rather than a combat injury can be seen in high resolution photographs of his dead body - these stills are examined by respected forensic pathologist Derrick Pounder in the film.”

Pounder describes the killing as homicide. “This is a murder - there’s no doubt about it,” he said.

Pounder said the boy, Balachandran Prabhakaran, had five dead males alongside him “who may well have been killed before he was killed”.

“We have no evidence that he was blindfolded and he’s been shot by someone standing in front of him with the end of the gun within a few feet of his body,” he said.

In Colombo, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence dismissed as “baseless and unacceptable” the documentary by the British Channel 4 television.

The ministry charged that Channel 4 opted to air the documentary despite their inability to verify the authenticity of footage if confronted by a responsible body.

“It is noted that the Channel 4 has come up with the second and similar video at defaming Sri Lanka at the current UN summit for Human Rights held in Geneva.

“The ministry of defence rejects all allegations of human rights violations stating that it is able to prove with valid evidence that it was the LTTE that committed gross violations of human rights over the past three decades,” the ministry said in a statement.

Sri Lanka alleges that Channel 4 was influenced by the pro-LTTE diaspora in Britain who are targeting the government for its action to crush the LTTE.

The documentary was aired at a time when the UN Human Rights Council is expected to debate a US-sponsored resolution against Sri Lanka’s rights accountability.
