PM Narendra Modi addressed the inaugural session of the all India conference of Law Ministers via video conferencing on October 15. "It's important for us to break the shackles of colonialism by removing regressing colonial laws, then only India can progress in the true sense. In the last 8 years, we removed 32,000 compliances to improve ease of living.  In Gujarat, we started evening courts. Cases that were of petty crimes were heard in these courts, thus reducing the burden on courts and allowing speedy resolution of matters. Technology has become an integral part of the judicial system in India. Digital innovations in legal services like virtual hearing and e-filing are already launched in India and 5G services would further strengthen these technologies," he said. ADVERTISEMENT
