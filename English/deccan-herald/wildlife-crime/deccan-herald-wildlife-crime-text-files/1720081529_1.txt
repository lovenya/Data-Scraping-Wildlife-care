A man was brutally murdered allegedly by a group of eight persons for not ceding to their demand of Rs 10 lakh in Gujarat's Bhavnagar city, police said today.

The murder, which took place at about 11.30 PM on Thursday, was captured by the CCTV cameras at a nearby residential apartment, in which the victim is seen being chased and beaten to death, they said.

According to a complaint lodged by Irfan Makwana, the assailants had demanded an extortion sum of Rs 10 lakh from his brother Rafiq Makwana or else to transfer his vegetable shop to their names.

He was first attacked at his vegetable shop near Amba Chowk, and when he fled, the assailants, who were armed with swords, baseball bats, chased him down.

A case has been registered under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 384 (extortion) and 302 (murder) among other sections of IPC.

Six persons -- Sandeep Bharatbhai, Hardik Uluwa, Sajid, Jitubhai Rabadi, Raja Majicwala and Taku -- have been named in the FIR while two are unidentified.

The local crime branch is investigating the case, though nobody has been arrested yet.

"We are studying the CCTV footage," police sub-inspector of the Local Crime Branch, S N Chudasama said. ADVERTISEMENT//
