Truth always wins. He has been jailed because he has been building good schools and the Aam Aadmi Party is getting popular," the AAP supremo said.Making a veiled attack on the BJP, Kejriwal further said, "They want to halt the progress of Delhi's education.""They (BJP) want Delhi's education revolution to come to an end but we will not let that happen. Everyone around the world has the same opinion about government schools in Delhi, that our schools are the best," he claimed.
