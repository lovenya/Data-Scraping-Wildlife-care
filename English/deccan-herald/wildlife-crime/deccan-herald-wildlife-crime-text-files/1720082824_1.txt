Bengaluru got an exclusive cyber crime police station on Saturday. Located at the police commissioner’s office on Infantry Road, the cyber crime police station will be part of the Central Crime Branch (CCB). 

Till now, the city was served by the cyber crime police station that had jurisdiction over the central police range which covers Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Tumakuru, Kolar, Chikkaballapur and Ramanagaram districts. Similar cyber crime police stations were set up in Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Davangere, Mysuru and Mangaluru with jurisdiction over the respective police ranges. These police stations can investigate cyber frauds to the tune of Rs 5 lakh and above. Online frauds to the tune of Rs 50 lakh are investigated by the cyber crime police station which is part of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). 

Bengaluru’s cyber crime police station, however, will not have such restrictions and it can investigate online frauds of any sum. People can file complaints at the cyber crime police station or approach the jurisdictional police station. “Cyber crimes registered at other police stations in the city will be transferred to the cyber crime police station for investigation, if needed,” Bengaluru Police Commissioner Praveen Sood told DH.

The cyber crime police station in Bengaluru will be staffed by two teams headed by inspectors and consist of two sub-inspectors and 16 constables, who will be trained by experts.
