Flocks of migratory birds from many European and other western countries have arrived in the wetlands of Kashmir this season with a message of peace and co-existence as violence in the Valley has ebbed in the recent months after a long time.ADVERTISEMENTThough arrival of such birds in winter is a centuries-old tradition, if the message carried in the cackle and flutter of these migratory birds goes unnoticed, Kashmir may turn a deaf ear to its own legacy of peace and harmony.With an efficiency unmatched even by the best human navigators, the migratory birds travel thousands of miles between their winter and summer homes.The arrival of avian from Siberia and China as well as the Philippines, Eastern Europe and Japan to spend the winter months in the relatively less harsh weather of the Valley has led to a riot of colour and cackle in the wetland reserves of Kashmir.Read | Decoded: Amur falcons' pit stop in NortheastThe wetlands in Kashmir attract the ‘foreign guests’ due to its ecological diversity of flora and fauna and aquatic vegetation.
