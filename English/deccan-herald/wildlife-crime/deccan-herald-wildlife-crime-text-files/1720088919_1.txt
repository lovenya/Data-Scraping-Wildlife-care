The most likely source of the novel coronavirus was a wildlife market in China, Australian Prime Minister said on Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTU.S. President Donald Trump last week said he was confident the coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese virology lab.Morrison, however, said Australia has seen no evidence to change its view that it originated from a wildlife market, though he would not rule out Trump's theory."We can't rule out any of these arrangements that's what I said the other day, but the most likely has been in a wildlife wet market," Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
