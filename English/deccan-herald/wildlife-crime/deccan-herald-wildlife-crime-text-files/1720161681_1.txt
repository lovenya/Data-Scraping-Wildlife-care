Ahead of the Uttarakhand Polls, Defence Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rajnath Singh addressed a public meeting on February 12 at Kapkot village in Bageshwar district. Defence Minister addressing the rally said, “Atal Bihari Vajpayee accorded special status to Uttarakhand. But when Congress came to power in state and Centre, it scrapped the special status of the state. When PM Modi came to power, he reinstated the status. “Congress should be questioned why did they scrap the special status accorded to Uttarakhand by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. What was its crime? Still, people of the state showed your large-heartedness and formed Congress government in the state from time to time,” he added.ADVERTISEMENT
