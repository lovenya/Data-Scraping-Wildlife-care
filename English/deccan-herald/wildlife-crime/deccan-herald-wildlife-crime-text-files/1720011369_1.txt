A man allegedly groped at least four women at Lulu Mall in Rajajinagar on Sunday. cops said. 

An eyewitness shot the video of the man groping a woman from behind and shared it on social media. The suspect appears to be middle-aged. The video showed him approaching the woman from behind and touching her inappropriately even as she remained oblivious to the act.

Yeshwanth Jayaprakash, the man who shot the video, said that the incident occurred between 6 pm and 6.30 pm and he noticed the man touching four to five women before being caught on camera. During that time, Jayaprakash was with his family at the mall, which was crowded on Sunday.  

“My sister noticed the man and told me that he was acting suspicious and had touched a woman,” Jayaprakash, 30, told DH.

“Initially, I thought it must have happened by mistake. But 10 to 15 minutes later, I saw the man move near a group of women and touch them. I understood that something was wrong.”

Before recording the video as proof, Jayaprakash followed the man for a few minutes and understood he was doing it purposely.

Jayaprakash immediately approached the mall security and reported the incident. “By the time the security personnel and I came to the spot and began looking for him, he wasn’t there,” Jayaprakash said.

“We searched the other floors too, but could not find him. Since I was moving around for a few minutes, I believe that he must have noticed me. I then approached the mall management team, explained the situation, and shared the video.”

The city police took note of the video shared on social media and contacted Jayaprakash, who shared the details. An FIR was registered at the Magadi Road police station under IPC Section 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).ADVERTISEMENT
