These cases are pertaining to seeking maintenance under section 125 of CrPC, seeking protection under section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2012 and a case registered under 498A of IPC and Dowry Prohibition Act, all cases filed by his wife. The petitioner had also filed a counter blast case against his wife, invoking extortion, criminal intimidation and other offences. The authorities had cited these cases and did not renew his passport.The central government advocate defended the action stating that proceedings are pending in three cases. The court examined section 6(2)(f) of the Passports Act and the October 10, 2019 office memorandum issued by the Ministry of External Affairs.“In the light of the aforesaid clarification, in cases where the proceedings are pending against the holders of the passports, when they seek renewal or reissuance, it cannot be denied on the ground that the proceedings are pending against those holders of the passports only in cases, where the proceedings are at the stage of crime, and the concerned criminal court has not taken cognizance of the offence. Any other proceeding pending invoking any other law will not become an impediment for the passport authorities for issuance/re-issuance/renewal of passport,” Justice Nagaprasanna said.The court has issued a direction to passport authorities to consider the application of the petitioner within 2 weeks time.
