 Perungalathur has been one of the worst affected areas in the city due to the continuous downpour since Sunday night.  As the video created panic, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department said there was no possibility of harm to humans if animals are left alone and unprovoked.  “Many are tweeting about this video. There are a few mugger crocodiles in several of the water bodies in Chennai. These are shy elusive animals and avoid human contact,”  Supriya Sahu, Additional Chief Secretary (Forests & Environment), said. Many are tweeting about this video.There are a few mugger crocodiles in several of the water bodies in Chennai.

Wildlife division has been alerted and they are on the job to avoid any untoward incident,” the bureaucrat added.
