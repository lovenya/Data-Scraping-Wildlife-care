Officials said Hadzic was detained on Wednesday north of Belgrade near his family home at Fruska Gora mountain.

The arrest is a significant milestone for Serbia, which in May arrested Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander. By capturing Mr. Hadzic, Serbia completed its obligations to the United Nations tribunal and removed another obstacle as it seeks greater access to 
Western money and acceptance by the European Union following decades of isolation.

President Tadic called a news conference to make the announcement of the arrest. “With this, Serbia has now concluded its most difficult chapter in the cooperation with The Hague tribunal,” Tadic said. 

Although Tadic said that Serbian investigators had been “working very hard in the past three years” to capture Mr. Hadzic, lawyers familiar with the case said that his whereabouts had been known and that secret negotiations had been going on for Hadzic to surrender. 

A reward of $1.4 million had been offered for his capture, but it was not clear if anyone was entitled to it.

The court indicted Hadzic in 2004 on 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity, including the massacre of several hundred men in 1991 when Croatian Serb rebels overran the town of Vukovar and deported some 20,000 non-Serbs from the town.ADVERTISEMENT
