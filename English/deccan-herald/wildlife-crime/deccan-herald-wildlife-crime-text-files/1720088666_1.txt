Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on December 09 criticised West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee by saying the state has "highest number" of female domestic crime and rape cases in the country, adding that the TMC government has stopped reporting these numbers to National Crime Records Bureau.

"Bengal has highest numbers for female domestic crime, human trafficking, and rape. Mamata di stopped reporting numbers to Crime Bureau; even refusing to give Covid numbers. Her government for political gains, has kept people from joining mainstream affairs," Nadda said at the inauguration of BJP's state election office in Kolkata. Assembly elections in West Bengal are expected to be held around May next year.ADVERTISEMENT
