The BJP organised a seminar called Karunada Mahila Jagruti Samvada on Saturday, where Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman participated.ADVERTISEMENT"It is not good to discriminate along gender lines while giving tickets to candidates. But all the parties are pushing for a male candidate because the voters have given priority to male candidates," said Nirmala.Nirmala feels only the BJP has given priority to women in politics. "Important ministries like defence and foreign affairs are given to women. This shows the real empowerment of women," she added."There is no protection for women and children in Karnataka. The Congress government has not taken appropriate measures to safeguard women, but is using this sensitive issue in politics," she said."But Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a historic decision to award the death penalty to those who rape children under the age of 12," the minister said. MP Shobha Karandlaje, for her part, said, "Women make up 50% of the voters' list. This percentage should be the same while issuing tickets to candidates, too."
