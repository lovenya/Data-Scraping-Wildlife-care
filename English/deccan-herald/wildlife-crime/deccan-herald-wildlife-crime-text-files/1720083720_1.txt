On the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi was playing host to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu in Gujarat on Wednesday, his one-time ally and Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Pravin Togadia was at his vitriolic best, levelling charges of "conspiracy" involving PM.ADVERTISEMENT"J K Bhatt appears to be hatching conspiracy   and harassing our nationalist worker at the behest of political bosses in Delhiâ€¦In the last 15 days, how many times has Bhatt spoken with PM. Their call details must be made public," Togadia told mediapersons during his discharge from hospital here.Togadia was referring to Joint Commissioner of Police Bhatt, who had on Tuesday debunked Togadia's claims that he was unconscious on his way to the airport and did not know how he landed in hospital. Togadia was also perturbed  by his close associate being picked up by 20 sleuths of Ahmedabad Crime Branch for interrogation at about 2 am on Wednesday.Togadia had gone missing on Monday morning after news broke out that Rajasthan Police had come to arrest him in an old case. It was news of Togadia landing unconscious at a local hospital late on Monday evening that helped calm frayed nerves of VHP workers."I have received communication from Rajasthan this morning that the case in which I was supposed to be arrested was withdrawn in 2015...This raises doubt as to under whose instructions did large posse of policemen come with an arrest warrant?" he said.Togadia, who went on to call PM his "old friend", said that he urged him (PM) not to conspire.
