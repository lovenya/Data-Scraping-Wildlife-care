The issue rocked both the Houses of the Maharashtra Legislature demanding the arrest of Vaze – with Leader of Opposition in Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar leading the charge.In Council, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced that Vaze has been removed from the Crime Branch, in Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab made a similar statement.Also read — Ambani bomb scare case: Hiren's wife suspects Vaze's role in death, seeks probeParab requested Fadnavis to submit documents and papers, if he has any, related to the death.Deshmukh said that Vaze has been removed from the post and the process of investigations is underway. “We will proceed as per law and procedures,” Deshmukh said, adding that an FIR has already been registered into the death of Mansukh Hiran by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ARS), which has been entrusted with the investigations."We will take appropriate action against Vaze if he is involved in his death,” he said.Fadnavis wanted to know why Vaze was being protected. “(Forest Minister) Sanjay Rathod had to resign (as his name came in Pooja Chavan death case) but Vaze is not being suspended...it is because Sanjay Rathod was not aware of secrets of some people in government....who is the government trying to protect,” he said.Meanwhile, Urban Development Minister and senior Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde said: “Maharashtra ATS and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) were probing the case of Mansukh Hiran's death and the recovery of explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence  of Ambani, respectively. The truth will come out after the probe is completed. It will be unfair to take action until the probe is completed. So Vaze will be transferred from his present posting.”
