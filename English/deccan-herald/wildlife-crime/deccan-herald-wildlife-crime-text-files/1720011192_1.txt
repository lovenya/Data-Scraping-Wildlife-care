As per our knowledge, he went to the Ittampar-Uspari area a few days ago on a personal visit to meet his acquaintance and he hasn’t returned home since then,” the SP said.After learning about the press release issued by the Naxalites, Kudiyam’s family and village elders have made an appeal for his safe release, Varshney said.On many occasions, the police have adopted a humanitarian approach in rescuing and saving the lives of Naxals who were injured in exchanges of fire, the SP said. “Hopefully, Shankar should return safely,” he added.Meanwhile, Sarva Adivasi Samaj (SAS), an umbrella body of tribal organisations, has appealed to Naxalites to release Kudiyam.SAS has urged Naxalites to free Kudiyam, if he is in their captivity, on the grounds that he joined the force to earn a livelihood for his family, said Sitaram Manjhi, a tribal leader.
