Besides the mangrove wetlands in Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also home to these species.However, the wild habitats in Bhitarkanika have the highest density and population of saltwater crocodiles.Odisha is the only state in the country which has gharial, mugger and saltwater crocodiles in the wild. The state government launched a conservation programme for these crocodile species in 1975.
