When the train was nearing the destination, they gave them juices laced with sedatives,” an investigator said. "It was a matter of luck, too, as sometimes, the passengers never entertained them."The police recovered the 120 grams of gold that was melted into gold bars.During questioning, the police found out Shaukat’s involvement in three cases registered at railway police stations in Thiruvananthapuram, Nagercoil and Garden Reach in Kolkata.
