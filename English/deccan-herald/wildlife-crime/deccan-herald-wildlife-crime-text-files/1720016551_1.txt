New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday sought a response from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on a plea by former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren seeking interim bail in a money laundering case arising out of an alleged land scam.ADVERTISEMENTA bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta issued notice to the ED and sought its written response on Soren's plea.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Soren, contended the charge sheet related to cheating and forgery. There is no money laundering or any allegation against the petitioner, the counsel claimed.The bench, however, said that the accusations in the case also mentioned proceeds of crime in relation to over several acres of land. Sibal said the Jharkhand High Court has not decided on his petition.The High Court had reserved its order on February 28.Soren was arrested by ED on January 31. Agreeing to examine the matter, the bench clarified that the Jharkhand High Court was free to deliver its judgment in Soren’s petition in the meantime. On April 24, Sibal had mentioned the matter before this bench, pleading to hear Soren’s case immediately in view of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. Soren had contended that the Lok Sabha polls would be over by the time he is out.On February 2, 2024, the Supreme Court had refused to entertain a plea by Soren against his arrest.His plea stated that ED officers abused their powers for extraneous considerations under the dictates of the central government as the petitioner is the leader of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a prominent opposition party and an active constituent of the I.N.D.I.A. bloc.Immediately after his arrest, Soren was taken to the Governor's House where he tendered his resignation as Chief Minister of the state.
