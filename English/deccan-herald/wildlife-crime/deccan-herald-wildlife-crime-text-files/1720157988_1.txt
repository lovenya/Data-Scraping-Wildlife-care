YouTube is monetising such content and has now started removing these videos. We will ask them what is the mechanism in place which vets such videos,” Kanungo told DH. In its letter, the NCPCR has asked Chatt to appear along with a list of all such Internet challenges posted on YouTube and a list of channels on YouTube running such challenges involving minors.Failing to comply, the NCPCR, will invite the invoking of Rule 10 and Rule 12 of Order XVI of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908.
