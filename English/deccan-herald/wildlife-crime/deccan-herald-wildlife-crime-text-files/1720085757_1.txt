A day after the regional transport authority renewed its crackdown on Rapido bike taxis, the cyber-crime police on Friday took up a preliminary inquiry against the company for operating bike through an app without any permission.ADVERTISEMENTDeputy transport commissioner from Bangalore Central Regional Transport Office (RTO) filed a complaint with the police that Roppen Transport Pvt Ltd (Rapido) was using a mobile app to provide bike taxi service illegally.Police, however, said they have not yet filed a first information report.“We have got a complaint but are yet to book the company. We are taking legal opinion on how to proceed,” they said.The complaint said the high court had instructed the transport authority to take strict action against those operating transport services and submit a report in this regard.  “No authority has given permission for the company to provide bike taxis. The service violates the Motor Vehicle Act and threatens the safety of passengers. The investigation has been done and cases have been registered in various RTOs. It is, therefore, requested to ensure the app is taken down,” the complaint read.Meanwhile, RTO officials impounded 18 bikes, in addition to 128 seized till Thursday. “Only a handful of officials are available for enforcement because of election duty. Besides, the company is blocking officials who are trying to monitor their activity.However, we will continue to take action on directions of the state transport authority,” a senior officer told DH.
