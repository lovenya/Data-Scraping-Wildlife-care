"We have set up a separate wing in the CCB to crack down on drug peddling and consumption," Jnanendra said.Speaking in the Assembly, Araga admitted that Kodagu's proximity with Kerala made it difficult to solve crimes as the accused tend to cross the border.According to the minister's written reply to Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan's question on policing in Kodagu, 252 cases are pending in district since 2019.
