Emerging from such a shambolic state will undoubtedly require time. Previously, the Kejriwal government transformed Delhi government schools into exemplars of excellence, and it's committed to doing the same for MCD schools.'  	 She further said that 'the BJP must address the dire situation of schools in its governed states, where essential infrastructure such as buildings, toilets, and classrooms are lacking'.
