He's not someone who will kill. He's a good person. It's just that he's a bit of an irritable person and brash in the way he speaks,” Udaya said about Darshan. The MLA said he and Darshan have been friends for many years. “But I don’t have information on what happened. An investigation is going on. The truth will come out,” he said.

Was this done by someone else and then came upon Darshan? The investigation should make things clear,” he said. On speculation that the government is under pressure to influence the case and bail out Darshan, Udaya denied this. “Law is the same for all. If there was influence, Darshan would not have gone into police custody for 10 days. There’s no question of protecting or fixing someone. What needs to happen will happen as per law,” he said, adding that investigation is happening transparently. Darshan campaigned for Udaya during the Assembly polls last year. The actor campaigned for Congress in Maddur for the recent Lok Sabha election as well.
