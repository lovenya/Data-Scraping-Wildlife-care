Maybe this will force the Modi govt not to press ahead with the widely opposed elephant-unfriendly amendments to the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972."In 2010, the elephant had been declared the national heritage animal, the former environment minister noted.Ramesh had opposed many provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2022, when it was passed in the Rajya Sabha in December last year. He had opposed the bill in the form it was tabled and expressed apprehension over the provision related to transfer or transport of any live elephant "for any other purpose" as it could be misused.The bill sought better management of protected areas and also provides for certain permitted activities like grazing or movement of livestock and bona fide use of drinking and household water by local communities. While Rajya Sabha passed the bill in December, Lok Sabha had cleared the legislation in August last year during the Monsoon session.
