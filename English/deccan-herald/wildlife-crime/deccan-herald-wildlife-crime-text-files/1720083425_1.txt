The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to consider if retweeting a ‘defamatory’ tweet amounted to a criminal offence.

AAP leader Raghav Chadha approached the apex court contending that a criminal defamation case was slapped on him just for retweeting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s tweet against Union minister Arun Jaitley.

A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Amitava Roy and A M Khanwilkar allowed a plea by Chadha, the spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party, for urgent hearing of his petition.

Senior advocate Anand Grover, representing Chadha, submitted that the AAP leader has been made to face the defamation case only because he retweeted certain alleged objectionable tweets of Chief Minister Kejriwal.

“This does not constitute (criminal) defamation,” Grover said. The counsel said he raised the same question before the Delhi High Court, but it was posted for consideration in October. On this, the apex court decided to hear the matter on September 11.

Kejriwal and other AAP leaders — Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh and Deepak Bajpai — faced a criminal defamation complaint as well as Rs 10 crore civil suit after they claimed that Jaitley was reportedly involved in corrupt practices when he was the president of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), a post he had held from 2000 to 2013.ADVERTISEMENT
