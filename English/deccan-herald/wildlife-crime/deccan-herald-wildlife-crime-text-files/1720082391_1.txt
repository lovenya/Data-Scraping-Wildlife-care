For failing to ensure that the terrapins were not suffering unnecessarily, he could be jailed for up to a year, fined up to SGD 10,000, or both.As his charge is amalgamated or groups together all the terrapins involved, he can face up to double this punishment and/or face up to twice the penalties on both counts.He was offered a bail of SGD 35,000 and is set to return to court next month, the report said.
