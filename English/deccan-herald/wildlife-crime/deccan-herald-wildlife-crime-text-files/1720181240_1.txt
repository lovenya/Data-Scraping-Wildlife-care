Officials of the Madhya Pradesh forest department on Friday dismissed as "fake" a media report on felling of trees to make arrangements for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit with around 300 guests for the release of eight cheetahs from Namibia in the Kuno National Park last week.ADVERTISEMENTThe report claimed that the national park had only one guesthouse and therefore, tents were pitched to accommodate the VIPs, which "entailed the cutting of a large number of trees".It also claimed that trees were felled for making helipads.Reacting to the report, a state department official said, "No tree was felled for making helipads at Kuno. The site selected as such was devoid of trees, the news about the felling of trees is absolutely false."Also Read | Project Cheetah or Project Vanity?"Neither there were 300 guests nor any tented accommodation was made for them.
