Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution seeking amendments in wildlife protection laws for efficacy in dealing with human-animal conflicts.ADVERTISEMENTKerala forest minister A K Saseendran moved the resolution that sought measures to regulate and control the population of wild animals such as wild boars that frequently enter human settlements and wreak havoc.It also suggested that wild boars that enter human settlements should be declared vermin, and batted for giving powers to chief conservators of forests to take immediate actions in case of wild animals entering human settlements and causing destruction.Meanwhile, close on the heels of the death of a wild elephant after being tranquilised in Wayanad in Kerala, a tiger that was tranquilised in Kannur died while being translocated. The male tiger was tranquilised after it was trapped in a fence at a human settlement at Kottiyoor in Kannur on Tuesday.
