Hundreds of Afghan women are languishing in prison for so-called “moral crimes”, which include running away from home and having sex outside marriage, campaign group Human Rights Watch said Wednesday.

“It’s shocking that 10 years after the overthrow of the Taliban, women and girls are still imprisoned for running away from domestic violence or forced marriage,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. 

The group estimated there are a total of 400 women in prison and girls in juvenile detention facilities having been accused or convicted of offences including “running away”, which is not a crime under the Afghan penal code.

“Some women and girls have been convicted of “zina” -- sex outside of marriage -- after being raped or forced into prostitution,” it added.

“Judges often convict solely on the basis of ‘confessions’ given in the absence of lawyers and ‘signed’ without having been read to women who cannot read or write. After conviction, women routinely face long prison sentences, in some cases more than 10 years.”

In a deeply conservative society many of the 58 inmates interviewed for the report expressed fears that they could be murdered by their families for reasons of “honour” after they were released.

HRW quoted one 17-year-old inmate named Khalida P, imprisoned for running away with a boy her parents had forbidden her to marry, as saying: “My parents come every week on visiting day. Every time they tell me that very soon they will pay the prison staff to give me to them and then they will kill me.”

The report also cited a woman sentenced to three years in prison after fleeing a father-in-law who raped her and had her brother murdered as saying: “I am happy here. Here I am not afraid because I know no one is coming in the night to kill me.”

Pardons issued

Karzai has regularly issued pardons for women convicted of “moral crimes”, but the HRW researcher Heather Barr said: “It's nice that he does this but it does not make up for something that is an injustice in the first place.
