Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia has written to the National Commission for Women (NCW) and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) seeking directions to the state government for effective prevention of crime against women.ADVERTISEMENTCiting cases of rape and atrocities against women, Poonia said during the tenure of the current government in Rajasthan, more than 8.61 lakh criminal cases have been registered so far, of which over 1.55 lakh cases are related to atrocities on women.“Of them, more than 25,000 cases are of rape and gangrape,” Poonia said.He said recently in Bhilwara district, a case of “sale and purchase of girls on stamp paper” came to the fore. Also, in the districts of Dungarpur, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, etc, cases of forcibly pushing teenage girls into “prostitution” and “trafficking” have also surfaced, he claimed in the letter.The BJP leader said law and order and women's safety has become a big challenge in the state.“The image of Rajasthan state has been tarnished by such incidents. Increasing criminal cases against women in Rajasthan state is very frightening and condemnable. Due to the inaction, insensitivity, laxity, poor law and order of the Rajasthan government, such incidents are continuously increasing,” he wrote in the letter.
