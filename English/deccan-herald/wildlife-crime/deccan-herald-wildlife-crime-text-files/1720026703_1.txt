On Monday, Naidu’s legal team filed a petition to secure an early release for him from the jail and procure house custody. The Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) Court in Vijayawada witnessed elaborate arguments on this petition. The former chief minister’s legal team is awaiting judgment on the house custody petition, which is expected to be pronounced on Tuesday. A team of legal experts led by Supreme Court lawyer Siddarth Luthra in his arguments expressed concerns over the security of Naidu in the prison while the CID opposed it. A local court in Vijayawada remanded Naidu in judicial custody for 14 days on Sunday. Currently, the former chief minister is lodged in the Rajamahendravaram Central Prison in East Godavari district.
