Bangkok: Thai authorities said they have seized 50 million methamphetamine tablets near the country's border with Myanmar - a record haul of meth pills for Thailand and the second-largest in Asia.ADVERTISEMENTThe tablets had been in large sacks at the back of a six-wheeled truck that was intercepted by Thai police officers and soldiers on Tuesday at a security checkpoint in western Kanchanaburi province, police said.A man and a woman who were in the truck have been arrested, they added.In terms of Asia meth drug busts, the seizure was second only to one of more than 55 million meth tablets in Laos near the Golden Triangle region, according to Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia regional representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
