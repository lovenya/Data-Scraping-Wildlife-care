'We are once again encouraging all temple leaders to download the @HinduAmerican temple safety guide...The guide specifically discusses that temple graffiti qualifies as a hate crime and also the importance of installing working security cameras and alarm systems in view of the rising threat from #Khalistan proponents as well as the omnipresent risk from anti-Hindu actors,' the post said.On December 23, the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple was vandalised and the US State Department condemned the vandalism of the Shri Swaminarayan temple in California.
