When a history sheeter exhibits suspicious behaviour or is seen at an unusual hour, the cameras, utilising facial recognition, send signals to the server in the command centre.The system analyses the activity, flags any suspicious behaviour, and notifies patrolling police, who are dispatched to the location promptly.Moreover, C4i maps various crimes based on data such as geographical location, timing, and nature of incidents. The software identifies vulnerable areas, prompting the department to intensify policing in those locations.Predictive PolicingThe Predictive Policing aspect uses algorithms to anticipate potential crimes based on the data it analyses.This enables the deployment of Hoysalas to specific locations where a crime is likely to occur.Unlike Preventive Policing, this system relies on data received through the helpline number calls, ensuring a proactive approach to law enforcement.Traffic supportThe system's algorithms also incorporate traffic-related data, including riding without helmets, congested spots, and hotspots of traffic violations.
