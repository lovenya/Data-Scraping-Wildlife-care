As of now the situation is under control. However, since leopards share common spaces with humans it is important to be alert and aware and follow necessary advisory and instructions from the forest department," said Sharma.He said the leopard that entered the Film City sets appeared to be in search of an easy prey."Dogs are easy to hunt as compared to wild prey. Also, due to increase in the cover of grass and shrubs wild prey species are comparatively difficult to kill," said Sharma.The forest department along with wildlife volunteers will install camera traps to track the movement of big cats, he said."People should walk in groups, must not venture alone in the dark near forested patches, use a torch while walking with mobile radio on so that if there is a wild animal around, it moves away as it's their natural instinct to avoid any conflict," Sharma said.
