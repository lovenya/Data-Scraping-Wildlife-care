Then he got to know that except for a pair of earrings, everything else was not real but 'rolled gold' (gold plated). To hide his crime, he chopped up her body into parts and stuffed it inside a drum at a vacant plot near an abandoned house," the officer said.The deceased, Sushilamma, and her daughter were living in a rented flat in Nisarga Layout in K R Puram. Sushilamma used to go to temples often and sometimes even to her son's house, so the daughter initially did not suspect anything amiss when her mother did not return home on Saturday night, according to the police.The body was found by the police on Sunday evening from a vacant plot near an abandoned house after local residents complained to the police about a foul smell emanating from the spot.
