But 18 per cent of the attacks were serious assaults and 22 homicides were motivated by hate.The latter figure is lower than the 52 murders recorded in 2019, a year of mourning for the El Paso shooting on the border with Mexico which killed 23 victims, mostly Hispanics.In the United States, "hate-motivated crime" usually refers to an act directed against a person because of certain characteristics of their identity.This aggravating circumstance automatically results in a heavier sentence, but it is difficult to prove in court.
