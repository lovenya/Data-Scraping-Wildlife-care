Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on October 04 in Raipur said that the BJP wants to suppress opposition and crush every voice against them. He said, “BJP wants to suppress opposition and crush any voice that is against them. Haryana CM ML Khattar's statement also shows their mentality that wants to end every opposition. This is a dictatorship. We will not tolerate it.” Why are not we allowed to go to Lakhimpur Kheri and meet victim families? Yesterday, police misbehaved with Priyanka Gandhi and stopped her in Sitapur without any warrant. Is sympathizing with anyone now a crime, he added.
