Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said the government is ready for a discussion in Lok Sabha on the issue of crime against women and willing to explore stringent provisions in laws to check incidents like the Hyderabad rape and murder case.ADVERTISEMENTResponding to a discussion during Zero Hour in the wake of the rape and murder of a veterinarian in Hyderabad, Singh said he was falling short of words to condemn the heinous crime."We are ready for discussions in the House so that stringent provisions in-laws could be explored to give punishment to those involved in such ghastly incidents," he said.
