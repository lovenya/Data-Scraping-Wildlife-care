A day after BJP accused the Congress of designing a toolkit to malign Kumbh as a “super spreader” Covid-19 event, Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev on May 19 went on guns blazing over ‘defaming’, terming it a social, cultural and political conspiracy and crime.ADVERTISEMENT“Defaming Kumbh Mela and Hinduism through Toolkit is a social, cultural & political conspiracy and crime. I request people doing this that they can do politics but don't insult Hindus. This country won't forgive you. I appeal to people to boycott and oppose such forces,” Ramdev said.
