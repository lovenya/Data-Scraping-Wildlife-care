We list the matter for final hearing on August 7. All parties should file short written submissions, synopsis and list of dates," the bench said.All the 11 convicts in the case were released in August, 2022, by the Gujarat government under its remission policy as the convicts had completed 15 years in jail.A batch of the petitions, including by Bilkis Bano, and former CPI-M MP Subhashini Ali, were filed against the premature release. In her plea, Bano claimed that the case was "one of the most gruesome crimes of extreme inhuman violence and brutality, persuaded by hate towards a particular community".
