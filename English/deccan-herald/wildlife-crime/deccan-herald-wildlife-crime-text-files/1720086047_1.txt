Upgradation and strengthening law and order in the states will remain our priority."The Department of Prosecution and Anti-Narcotics Bureau will be also reinforced. For better Governance, we all must work with a pro-active approach, welcome constructive opinion and use modern technology, Shah said.The zonal councils provide a forum where irritants between the Centre and the states, and among the states themselves, can be resolved through free and frank discussions and consultations, an official said.The states have been divided into five zones and each zone has its council comprising the chief minister, two ministers and the chief secretary of each state.The zonal councils are headed by the Union home minister and each zone nominates one chief minister as its vice chairman on rotation basis.
