The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has delegated the state wildlife board and the chief wildlife wardens to clear projects pertaining to laying power cables and drinking water pipelines. 

This decision comes in the wake of pressure on the board and the forest departments of various states to clear many projects, especially those pertaining to infrastructure.

A senior forest department official said this was a bad move. “There is already a lot of political pressure on forest staffers to clear projects. The state wildlife board also has politicians as members. Now, this decision will only threaten forests even more,” the official, who did not want to be named, said.

The official said there was a lot of pressure from the state government to lay power lines across forests. In some places like MM Hills, cables were being laid illegally.

“Now, with this, we will be forced to give clearances to all proposals. Earlier, we would refer the case to the central government which would take a long time and even reject the proposal. But now, we will be under pressure,” he said.

Raman Sukumar, member, said that it was a general order. The rules of wildlife sanctuaries, tiger reserves and eco-sensitive zones will continue.

H S Singh, another member of NBWL said the powers have been delegated to the state board and chief wildlife wardens on condition that wildlife should not be threatened and that cables should be laid along road sides only.

Drinking water and electricity are the basic needs of people. The orders have been issued to mitigate conflicts and reduce pressure on forests, he said.
