The controversy surrounding actor Ganesh constructing a "permanent structure" in the eco sensitive zone (ESZ) of Bandipur took a new turn on Tuesday with Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre stating that the department has revoked the permit.ADVERTISEMENTKhandre was replying to a question by mediapersons on new constructions in wildlife corridors leading to conflicts. "The department had given permission for constructing a temporary shed. However, the permission was revoked following a complaint that he was building a permanent structure," he said, adding that the issue was pending before the court.Also Read:Need Rs 500 crore to prevent man-animal conflict: Forest Minister Eshwar KhandreAlso Read:Need Rs 500 crore to prevent man-animal conflict: Forest Minister Eshwar KhandreLast week, the high court allowed Ganesh to continue with construction activities at his land at Jakkahalli village, Gundlupet taluk in Chamarajanagar district.
