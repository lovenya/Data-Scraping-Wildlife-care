After Enforcement Directorate summoned Congress Interim President Sonia Gandhi and MP Rahul Gandhi in connection with the National Herald case, Bharatiya Janata Party National President JP Nadda on June 01 took a jibe at Party leaders saying that they will deny their crimes.ADVERTISEMENT“Have you ever seen a criminal say I’m criminal? They will (Sonia-Rahul Gandhi) of course deny it. Documents are proof. If the charge sheet is filed, you would approach the Court to get it quashed, but they sought bail,” he said.
