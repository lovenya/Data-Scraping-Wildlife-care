There are two types of vehicles: Canters and jeeps. Canters offer a far inferior experience compared to jeeps, with lower visibility,‚Äù the advocate argued.The petitioners stated that private resorts serve 71% of the guests in Nagarahole and 83% in the Bandipur national parks, yet they are offered fewer seats than their capacity warrants. JLR, which controls the allocation, secures the majority of seats.The counsel for JLR stated that the policy does not specify if vans or jeeps must be allocated, insisting that it is following the mandate of 50% allocation.
