Given the magnitude of the project and conservation significance of the project site, more structural and non-structural mitigation measures may be required to maintain landscape integrity and curtail impacts of fragmentations likely to be caused by the project," the Authority said in its order.Earlier, the state government had submitted a proposal to NTCA, seeking approval to divert forest land to take up Kalasa Nala diversion scheme in Khanapur taluk of Belagavi district as part of Mahadayi project.The proposal involved diversion of 26.92 hectares of forest land, including 10.68 hectares of forest that falls under the tiger corridor between Kali and Sahyadri tiger reserves.
