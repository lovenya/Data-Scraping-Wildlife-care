The DoT had taken up the challenge for preventing cybercrimes by conceptualizing and implementing an innovative and indigenous Artificial Intelligence (AI) based and Facial Recognition powered solution (ASTR) – the NextGen platform for detecting and weeding out fake/forged SIMs.The vision of the ASTR project is to analyze the whole subscriber base of all telecom Service Providers (TSPs) combined and cleanse the mobile subscriber database by identifying non-bonafide mobile numbers. The system uses subscriber images and a subscriber database provided by the Telecom Subscriber Providers (TSP) to DoT, to detect the same face and different names.
