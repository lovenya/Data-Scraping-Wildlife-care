Sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) brought the prime suspect in the court blast case to Mysuru on Friday. He was grilled by Mysuru police officers and then taken to the district court complex for reconstruction of the crime scene. 

ADVERTISEMENTDawood Suleman, 23, a software engineer from Chennai, who was arrested in Madurai on Monday, was interrogated by Deputy Commissioner of Police N Rudramuni and Assistant Commissioner of Police Mallik. At 12.45 pm, he was taken to the Mysuru court where he was asked to explain in graphic detail how he had planted the bomb in a toilet that left two people injured. 

Sources said Suleman had “carefully planned” the crime as he had carried the bomb in a bus. On August 1, he boarded a government bus in Madurai to travel to Mysuru via Coimbatore and Chamarajanagar. He alighted at Hardinge Circle in Mysuru at 2.15 pm and reached the court. Carrying the explosive and the pressure cooker in a college bag, he headed to the court. 

Initially, the suspect had planned to plant the bomb in the parking lot of the court, but changed his mind as it was too crowded. He then decided to plant it in the toilet. As he scurried out of the toilet after planting the bomb, he was intercepted by a sanitation worker who asked him to pay Rs 10 pay for using the restroom. Suleman quickly paid the sum and darted out of the court premises. 

According to sources, Suleman then hailed an autorickshaw to reach Hardinge Circle where he boarded a bus that took him to Chennai via Salem. The short conversation with the sanitation worker proved to be a crucial lead in the investigation. The worker later identified the suspect.
 
The NIA team, along with the suspect, left Mysuru for Madurai at 5.15 pm.
