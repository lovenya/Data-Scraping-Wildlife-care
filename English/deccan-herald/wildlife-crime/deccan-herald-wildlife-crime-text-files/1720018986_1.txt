A Hong Kong court sentenced a man to three months imprisonment on Thursday for allegedly insulting China's national anthem by splicing a protest song onto a video clip of a Hong Kong athlete being presented with a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.ADVERTISEMENTMagistrate Minnie Wat said a deterrent sentence was needed as the anthem is a symbol of a country's dignity and territorial integrity.Photographer Cheng Wing-chun, 27, had earlier this month been found guilty of insulting the anthem at the Eastern Magistrates' Court. He had pleaded not guilty.Also Read | China's top spy catcher named head of national security office in Hong KongThe court heard how Cheng had uploaded a YouTube video in which he substituted China's national anthem with a popular protest song, Glory to Hong Kong during a gold medal presentation ceremony for Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung.The video was widely shared with 90,000 views, according to the magistrate.Also Read | Hong Kong court convicts 3 members of Tiananmen vigil group for security offenceCheng is the first person tried under the national anthem law that was passed in 2020.
