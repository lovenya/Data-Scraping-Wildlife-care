The Jagan Reddy-led party is blatantly curtailing freedom of expression and threatening their own leaders with possible outcomes”, said Pawan Kalyan.Emphasizing on crime against women in the state, he said, “If YSRCP is re-elected in 2024, the crime rate may escalate to the point where people won't feel secure even in their homes.”Extending solidarity to Naidu, Pawan said he is ready to support him during the "challenging times". He said, "Naidu's extensive experience of governance and developmental efforts during his regime are noteworthy. In 2024, the TDP-Jana Sena government will be established to bring much-needed change to Andhra Pradesh.”"Jagan is scared of the Naidu and Pawan Kalyan," Nara Lokesh said adding that Naidu was sent to jail after "arresting him illegally".
