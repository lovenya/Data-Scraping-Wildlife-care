Bengaluru: Days after five people were arrested for assaulting a shopkeeper over playing loud music, a suspect’s mother has filed a counter-complaint at the Halasuru Gate police station.ADVERTISEMENTThe Halasuru Gate police arrested Suleman, Shah Nawaz, Rohit, Tarun and a minor for the alleged assault on Mukesh, a shopkeeper in Siddannagalli in Nagarathpete, on March 17.As per the First Information Report (FIR), the argument was related to loud music on a portable speaker. However, the incident took a communal turn when Mukesh claimed that the altercation was over his playing the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’.Mukesh’s revised statement was attached later by the police.During the probe, the police found that Mukesh was playing “loud Hindi songs” on his portable speaker and the suspects asked him to lower the volume as it was time for Azan (Islamic announcement or call to prayer), a police officer told DH, adding that an argument ensued, which led to a melee.On March 27, the Halasuru Gate police registered a separate FIR based on the counter-complaint by Suleman’s mother. The complainant alleged that the shopkeeper had been playing loud music for three to four days.“Suleman and his friends questioned the shopkeeper about the loud sound as it was affecting 3,000 people offering prayers for Ramzan,” the FIR noted. “The shopkeeper, Mukesh, assaulted Suleman and his friends and abused them.”A case has been registered under sections 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), an officer said.
