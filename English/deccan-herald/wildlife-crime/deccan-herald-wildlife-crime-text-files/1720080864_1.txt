Dakshina Kannada District Congress Committee spokesperson A C Vinayraj on Saturday charged that crime against dalits are on the rise in BJP-ruled states in the country.

ADVERTISEMENTAddressing media,Vinayraj said 8,028 and 7,893 cases of sexual assault and atrocity against dalits have been recorded, since BJP led government was formed in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh respectively. 

Similar is the situation at other BJP-ruled States like Gujarat, Haryana and Maharashtra (where party is in coalition with Shiv Sena). 

Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains mum, when he extensively uses social media to instantly post his reaction over other issues, he criticised.

Vinayraj said such is the tendency of Sangh Parivar and their like-minded organisations that, they are involved in abusing women since BJP returned to power at the Centre. 

He cited the recent example of Uttar Pradesh BJP State unit vice-president Dayash-ankar Singh who made a derogatory statement against Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayavathi, also a dalit leader.
