Vinayak, the prime accused in the case, is their son. Investigation revealed that Vinayak had given ‘supari’ for the murder of his father, Prakash, step-mother Sunanda and step-brother Karthik, over a property dispute.Prakash and Sunanda are local BJP functionaries, with the latter being the vice president of the Gadag-Betageri City Municipal Council.Police said Prakash had several properties in the name of Vinayak and the latter had sold three properties without his father’s notice, five months ago. Both had a quarrel over the issue and Prakash had warned his son of dire consequences if he sold any property without his (Prakash's) notice. Infuriated by this, Vinayak hatched the murder conspiracy.Vinayak had given 'supari' for Rs 65 lakh to one Fairoz, who deals with second-hand cars. Fairoz, in turn, hired five contract killers from Miraj. On April 19, Parashuram (uncle of Vinayak), his wife Lakshmibai and their daughter Akanksha set out to Koppal, but returned home as they missed the train. The killers had no idea about these guests staying in the house, police said.The police officer said Vinayak tried to escape when he was caught.
