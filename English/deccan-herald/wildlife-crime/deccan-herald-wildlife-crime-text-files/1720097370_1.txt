Mumbai: Nine wildlife traffickers have been caught during a joint operation conducted by the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD) and Gujarat Forest Department (GFD) besides NGOs like Wildlife SOS.ADVERTISEMENT“The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 of India serves as a critical barrier against the trade of more than 1,800 species of wild animals, plants, and their derivatives. Despite this, the illicit wildlife trade is rapidly expanding fuelled by the demand for rare species, wrongly used for medicinal purposes or as ornaments,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS.Besides, MFD, GFD and Wildlife SOS, others involved in the operations were Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA), Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), according to an official statement.A mission to combat wildlife trafficking gained momentum when informants from the Wildlife SOS-GSPCA team gathered intelligence about individuals attempting to sell wildlife contraband. In response, Wildlife SOS-GSPCA, in collaboration with the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and the Gujarat Forest Department, conducted a targeted operation in Kaprada Taluka of Valsad district of Gujarat. The joint effort led to the confiscation of leopard skin along with four leopard paws, resulting in the apprehension of seven suspects involved in this illicit trade.Also Read:Wildlife Odyssey at Melghat Tiger Reserve to spot the endangered Forest OwletAlso Read:Wildlife Odyssey at Melghat Tiger Reserve to spot the endangered Forest OwletIn a separate incident, based on extensive intelligence shared by Wildlife SOS-GSPCA, a joint raid was carried out by the Maharashtra Forest Department and WCCB near the Trimbakeshwar temple premises in Nashik in Maharashtra.
