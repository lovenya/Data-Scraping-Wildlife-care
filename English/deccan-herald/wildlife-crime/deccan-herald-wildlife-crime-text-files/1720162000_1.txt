"Where's the law and order when such things could happen in the central part of the city," a woman says in a video posted on X. "The culprit must be given the death penalty, and the government must make an example of him." The woman continued: "Shouldn't little girls play outside? CCTV cameras are here. Police must launch an investigation and track down the culprit." The video shows a relative of the girl saying the family members had left for work when the girl was sexually assaulted.
