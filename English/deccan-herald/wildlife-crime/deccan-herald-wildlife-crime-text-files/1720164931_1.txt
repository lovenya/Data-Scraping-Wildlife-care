However, Beniwal added that RLP is not opposed to allying with regional parties that have a support base. “Our yatra is named 'Satta Sankalp Vyavastha Parivartan Yatra' which will start from Salasar Balaji on September 28,” he told reporters here on Sunday. Beniwal said that without power, there cannot be any “change in the system.” 	 The RLP will not be in an alliance with the Congress or BJP but the doors are open for other parties such as BSP and BTP, Beniwal said. The RLP leader said that increasing crime and unemployment enabled by corruption are big issues in the state and to awaken the youth, the farmers and the rest, the party will be taking out the yatra. He added that the RLP put up a challenge to both the Congress and BJP in the 2018 assembly elections. The party currently has three MLAs.
