Hitting back at Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Gopal Italia on his controversial remark on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother Heeraben Modi, Union Minister of Women and Child Development Smriti Irani on October 14 lashed out at Arvind Kejriwal citing that it won’t be surprising if he falls to new lows. She said, “With blessings of Arvind Kejriwal, AAP leadership in Gujarat maliciously attacked PM’s 100-year-old mother. That Kejriwal could fall to new lows isn’t surprising. Her only crime-she gave birth to Narendra Modi. Your leaders and workers seek to punish and abuse her.”ADVERTISEMENT
