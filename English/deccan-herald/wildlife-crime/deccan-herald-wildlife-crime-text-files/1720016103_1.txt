After seven days of persistent efforts, they apprehended Mulla in the early hours of March 22, he added.Additional Superintendent of Police Pankaj Shirsat said the accused killed the victim as she kept insisting on marrying him, although he was against the idea.Following his arrest, a court in Palghar has remanded Mulla in police custody till April 2, he said.
