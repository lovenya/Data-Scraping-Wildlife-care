The number of crimes registered in the city went up in 2016 compared to that of previous years. However, there was been a decline in crimes against women and children, according to the annual crime statistics. Police Commissioner N S Megharikh released the data on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENTSpeaking on the occasion, Megharikh said that special teams would be constituted to crack a large number of undetected crimes. He said that there were 10 firing incidents during the unscheduled protests that turned violent during the year.

"More than 100 police personnel were injured in these protests and thousands of arrests were made. We have found that those who resorted to violence were unruly elements and not farmers, garment workers or students,” he stated.

The commissioner said though north and south division police had recovered more than 400 mobile phones, only a dozen complaints had been registered regarding theft of mobile phones. He urged Bengalureans to report crimes and lodge complaints. “Complaints can be lodged on e-lost portal,” he said.
