Marking the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia Tuesday, the UN commissioner urged governments to do "much more" to eliminate discrimination and prejudice based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

"No one is entitled to treat a group of people as less valuable, less deserving or less worthy of respect. Each and every one of us is entitled to the same rights, to the same respect and ethical treatment, regardless of our sexual orientation or gender identity," Xinhua quoted her as saying.

She said homosexuality and transsexualism have been present in all societies throughout human history. "Homophobia and transphobia are no different from sexism, misogyny, racism or xenophobia. History shows us the terrible human price of discrimination and prejudice," she added.ADVERTISEMENT
