"The directions which have been sought pertain to the legislative and policy domain. Hence, this court would not be justified in exercising the jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution," the bench, also comprising justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said in its order passed on August 14.Article 32 of the Constitution empowers Indian citizens to move the apex court directly for enforcement of their fundamental rights through appropriate proceedings."The petition is accordingly dismissed," the bench said.The plea, filed by a Delhi resident, had sought a judicial order to constitute a high power committee to formulate guidelines in respect of appointment, transfer and take disciplinary actions against the members of the proposed NISCC.
