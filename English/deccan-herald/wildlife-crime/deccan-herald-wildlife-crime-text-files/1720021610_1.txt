The HC said the vacation judge did not appropriately consider the materials on record in the liquor policy scam case.On June 24, the Supreme Court had declined to grant any relief to Kejriwal on his plea questioning the June 21 order of stay passed by the Delhi High Court on his bail.On June 20, in a relief, Kejriwal was granted him bail in the ED's case by a vacation judge. Kejriwal is alleged to be prime accused and main conspirator in the case. On June 5, the trial court rejected Kejriwal's medical bail plea on the ground that his involvement in the crime could not be ruled out. Earlier on May 10, the Supreme Court had granted bail to Kejriwal till June 1 in order to let him participate in election campaigns for Lok Sabha polls, and asked him to surrender on June 2. The apex court is yet to pronounce its order on his challenging validity of his arrest by the ED.
