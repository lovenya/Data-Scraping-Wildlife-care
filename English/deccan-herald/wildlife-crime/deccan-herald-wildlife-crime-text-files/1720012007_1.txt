It was also alleged that Abdullah Azam had got two different birth certificates - one issued by the Rampur Municipality in which his date of birth was mentioned as 30 September, 1990, and in another the date of birth was mentioned as January 1, 1993.Reacting to the decision of the court, SP president Akhilesh Yadav said that a conspiracy had been hatched against Azam Khan by some officials who enjoyed the patronage of the BJP. ''Aazam Khan and his family are being targeted... it is part of a broad game plan to terrorise a section of the society,'' Akhilesh said.Earlier Azam Khan had been found guilty in a hate speech case by the MP/MLA Court (magistrate trial), which sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. The prosecution had contended that Azam Khan had made objectionable remarks against UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the district magistrate of Rampur at an election rally.
