New Delhi: The government has directed telecom operators to block all incoming international spoofed calls that display Indian mobile numbers, an official statement said on Sunday.ADVERTISEMENTThe Department of Telecom (DoT) said that it has been reported that fraudsters are making international spoofed calls displaying Indian mobile numbers to Indian citizens and committing cyber-crime and financial frauds.Such calls appear to be originating within India but are being made by cyber-criminals from abroad by manipulating the calling line identity (CLI) and have been misused in recent cases of fake digital arrests, FedEx scams, drugs or narcotics in courier, impersonation as government and police officials, disconnections of mobile numbers by DoT or TRAI officials, etc."DoT and Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have devised a system to identify and block such international spoofed calls from reaching any Indian telecom subscriber. Now directions have been issued to the TSPs for blocking such incoming international spoofed calls," the statement said.Also Read:Truecaller gets new AI feature to block spam callsAlso Read:Truecaller gets new AI feature to block spam callsThe incoming international spoofed calls with Indian landline numbers are being already blocked by the TSPs as per the directions issued by DoT."Despite best efforts, there may still be some fraudsters who succeed through other means.
