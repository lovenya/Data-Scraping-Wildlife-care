He visited the bar daily.On Wednesday, Viji began drinking at the bar around 7 pm, while Girish and Lokesh came around 10.30 pm and got drunk. They asked Viji to pay for their drinks, but Viji teased Girish as 'kunta' and refused to pay. The altercation continued in the bar until they eventually left at 11.20 pm. They fought again in an adjacent lane.In a fit of rage, the duo assaulted Viji. They struck his head with a hollow brick after he fell on the road and fled the scene. The cashier at the bar, Lakkanagowda, alerted the police, resulting in the duo’s swift arrest. They have since been produced in court and remanded to judicial custody.
