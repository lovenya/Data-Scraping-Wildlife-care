The reservoir will make use of the natural slope of the river from Shivanasamudra to the state border. As per estimates, the project is expected to cost Rs 9,000 crore.Previously the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government had set aside Rs 1,000 crore for the project, even as approvals are pending from the Centre.
