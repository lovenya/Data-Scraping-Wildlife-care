A Rs 500-crore centre is likely to be set up by the government soon to deal with cyber crime which is increasing by 40 per cent annually.

ADVERTISEMENTThe move comes after an expert committee, set up to prepare a roadmap for effectively tackling cyber crime in the country and give suitable recommendations to tackle it, submitted its report to Home Minister Rajnath Singh today.

Among the recommendations, the committee suggested the government set up 'Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre' (ICCCC) at the national level having branches in all states.

The Centre will have linkages with CCTNS and NATGRID, the two database having information related to various kinds of crime and criminals.

One of the priorities of ICCCC will be how to check attempts of international gangs to penetrate Indian government official communication network and hack them.

An Advance Application for Social Media Analytics may also come up to monitor social media platforms activities related to Ministries of Home, External Affairs, Defence and other government organisations.

The committee also suggested to the government to reduce dependence on foreign servers and ensure one dedicated secure gateway for all government communication.

The Home Minister asked all concerned for immediate processing and implementation of the report called 'Roadmap for Effectively Tackling Cyber Crimes in the Country'.

The expert group was constituted by the Home Ministry on December 24, 2014, a Home Ministry release later said.
