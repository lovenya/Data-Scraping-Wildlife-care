He had been briefly trained in dog handling by a person retired from the BSF, but was thrown out from there for asking questions like how to make dogs bite someone wearing khaki," the SP had said.The police official had also said the accused under the guise of being a dog trainer was selling drugs and the same was evident from the seizure of over 17 kg of ganja from the site.According to preliminary investigation, the accused was living here on rent and was known to everyone in the area as a dog trainer."Therefore, people used to leave their dogs with him, at the rate of Rs 1,000 per day, when they went outside and he would look after the canines," Karthick had said.
