The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has imposed a fine of Rs 100 crore on Haryana government with regard to unremediated legacy waste, which is damaging the environment and public health.ADVERTISEMENTThe principal bench of NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, in a recent order, noted that a meeting held by the Chief Minister on December 7, 2020 and the appointment of a senior IAS officer to coordinate the work have not produced tangible result, as it took one year to handover 10 acres of land to set up the Waste To Energy Plant.The original plea in the issue contended that the Bandhwari landfill site in Gurugram is being dumped by about 33 lakh metric tonnes of solid waste since years.Also Read | Steps being taken to keep Chandapura lake clean, Bengaluru DC tells NGTAs per the plea, the waste is being burnt, causing air pollution which has the potential to affect not only the inhabitants, but also the Asola Bhati Wildlife Sanctuary having 193 species of birds, large number of medicinal plants and more than 80 species of butterflies, black buck, golder jackal, leopards etc."Out of 2,20,082 tonnes of RDF, only 76,226 tonnes were uptaken.
