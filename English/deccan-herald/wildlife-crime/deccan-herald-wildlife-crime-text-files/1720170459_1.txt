You will come to know about the number of crimes against women during the BJP’s rule, if you look at crime records. What will Nadda say about a BJP MLA in Uttar Pradesh who is jailed for raping a minor girl? What will Union minister Pralhad Joshi say?” he said.Siddaramaiah told reporters here that the government was taking all action as per law in the case.“No such incident should happen in a civilised society. The guilty should be punished. The suspects are already arrested. Steps are being taken to give compensation to the victim,” he added.

Is telling that politics?”.
