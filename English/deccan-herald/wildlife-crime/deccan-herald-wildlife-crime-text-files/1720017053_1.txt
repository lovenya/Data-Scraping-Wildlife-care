This would mean that the 24 associations linked to the KFCC will refuse to work with the star, he added.According to him, KFCC had tried to enforce a ban before but were compelled to repeal that.Meanwhile, even as the Karnataka film fraternity is mum over the unfolding events, refusing to comment on Darshan’s arrest or possible involvement in the murder, as well as the toxic fan culture in the southern India, director Ram Gopal Varma, who had always been vocal about the unhealthy fan obsession, took to X to post his thoughts.“A star using one die-hard fan to kill another die-hard fan who was interfering in his personal life is a fit example of the bizarreness of the star worship syndrome… "A star using one die hard fan to kill another die hard fan who was interfering in his personal life is a fit example of the bizarreness of the star worship syndrome ..Fans wanting to order how their stars should run their lives is a unavoidable side effect of the same syndrome— Ram Gopal Varma (@RGVzoomin) June 13, 2024


"Fans wanting to order how their stars should run their lives is an unavoidable side effect of the same syndrome,” posted Varma on X.
