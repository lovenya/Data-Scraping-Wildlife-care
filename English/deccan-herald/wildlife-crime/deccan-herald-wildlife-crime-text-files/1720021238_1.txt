As many as 55 children under the age of four also underwent sexual abuse.Among the 5,002 accused, 115 were women and among the survivors, 578 were males and the remaining females.Over the years, Kerala has also seen a steady increase in the number of cases being registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (POSCO).While 3,030 POCSO cases were registered in 2020, it increased to 3,322 in 2021 and further increased to 4,582 in 2022.Kumar said that the increase in the number of POCSO cases was the result of proper awareness initiatives at various levels. “The reporting of sexual abuses against children has increased following awareness campaigns. However, in many cases of abuse by the lovers, there was a tendency for settling the cases once the accused gave the assurance to marry the survivor,” he added.
