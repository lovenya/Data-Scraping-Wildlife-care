Boss’ pasted next to it -- an apparent reference to Darshan -- was shared by an Instagram user, who said it is "trending".In a letter to the Cyber Crime Division of the Criminal Investigation Department, the KSCPCR Chairperson K Naganna Gowda said action should be taken against those responsible for sharing the photographs.“We don’t even call children as accused or criminals even when they do something wrong unknowingly. We call them ‘children involved in legal fight’. Such effects should not befall on children,” Gowda said in his letter.“Instead of providing a good atmosphere for children we should not thrust our love or blind love for someone on them,” he said.
