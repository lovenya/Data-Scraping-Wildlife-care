The National Crime Records Bureau’s latest “Crime in India” report lays bare a distressing crime scenario in the country. Around 7.3 million criminal cases were registered in 2015, an increase of 3.4% over the previous year. Although the rate of increase is less between 2013 and 2014, that the number of crimes continues to grow is reason for concern. While riots in the country witnessed a small increase overall, agrarian riots surged by 327%. This is a reflection of the grave agrarian crisis in the country, which is increasingly being manifested violently. It is time that India took this crisis seriously as it is not a simple law and order issue but a problem that has roots in the economic policies and structural violence. According to the NCRB report, communal riots decreased in 2015, down to 789 from 1,277 cases in 2014. However, one needs to treat this figure with caution as the latest Home Ministry report points to a small increase in incidents of communal riots.

Overall, the number of crimes against women decreased from 3,37,922 in 2014 to 3,27,394 in 2015. The number of rape and gang-rape cases fell, albeit marginally. However, the large number of rape cases is worrying as is that of kidnap, assault and sexual harassment of women. The data indicates that in 95% of the rape cases, the assailant was known to the victim. Forcing a woman into marriage was the main motivation for close to 54% of all abductions of women.

Crimes targeting children rose by over 5% in 2015. This and the gravity of crimes against children is reason – sexual offences and kidnap account for 81% of all crimes against minors – for serious concern. Children comprise the bulk of those trafficked and 88.5% of them are girls, the majority of whom are then sold for prostitution. Over 8,000 children were raped in India in 2015; in 95% of the cases, the perpetrator was known to the child. Some 10% of the rapists were family members or relatives and 36% were neighbours. The distressing picture laid bare by the NCRB data is likely to be far worse in reality. Child sexual abuse is rarely reported given the shame and secrecy that shrouds this crime. Children are often not in a position to articulate this crime let alone report it, especially when it is committed by a person in a position of trust. Their screams are silenced for the sake of family honour. Crimes against children and human trafficking deserve greater attention and action from the government.
