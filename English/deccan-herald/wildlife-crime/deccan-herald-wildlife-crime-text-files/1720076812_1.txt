Two females and a male rhino calves rescued during the 2019 floods are a step closer to being back in the wild. The calves were rescued by Assam Forest Department (AFD) and the IFAW- WTI vets from Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. All three will undergo health check-ups and marking before being shifted to national park.ADVERTISEMENT
