The three female students suffered burn injuries after the acid attack by a youth at a government pre-university college in the taluka headquarters town of Kadaba in Dakshina Kannada district, police said. The youth has been identified as Abin Shibi (23) hailing from Nilambur in Malappuram district of Kerala, said a police official. Shibi, who has been arrested, claimed during interrogation that one of the victims had spurned his amorous advances, and he took this "extreme step to show his disappointment in love." He had targeted only the girl, who suffered third degree facial burn injuries in the attack. But the acid also spilt over the other two students, who were sitting close to her, he claimed. He wore a school uniform, mask and cap to conceal his identity and approached them with a bottle and threw acid, police said.
