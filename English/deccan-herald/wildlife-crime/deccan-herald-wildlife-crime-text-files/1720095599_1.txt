Lucknow: Mukhtar Ansari straddled the worlds of crime and politics in Uttar Pradesh. The gangster-politician was booked in 65 criminal cases ranging from murder to extortion and was elected an MLA five times on the tickets of different political parties.ADVERTISEMENTAnsari, 63, died of cardiac arrest in a hospital in Banda on Thursday.Born into an influential family in 1963, Ansari entered the world of crime to establish himself and his gang in the government contract mafia that was then flourishing in the state.His tryst with crime began as early as 1978, when Ansari was just 15 years of age. He had his first brush with the law when he was booked for criminal intimidation at Saidpur Police Station of Ghazipur.Almost a decade later in 1986, by the time he had become a well-known face in the contract mafia circle, another case of murder was lodged against him at Muhammad Police Station of Ghazipur.Over the next decade, Ansari became a common face of crime with at least 14 more cases under serious charges lodged against him.His growing criminal graph, however, did not hinder his entry in politics.Ansari was first elected an MLA in the UP assembly in 1996 on a ticket from Bahujan Samaj Party from Mau. He continued his successful run on the seat as an independent candidate in 2002 and 2007 assembly elections.Also Read:Mukhtar Ansari hospitalised, condition 'stable'; brother alleges he was poisoned in jailAlso Read:Mukhtar Ansari hospitalised, condition 'stable'; brother alleges he was poisoned in jailIn 2012, he launched Qaumi Ekta Dal (QED) and won from Mau again.He won from Mau again in 2017.
