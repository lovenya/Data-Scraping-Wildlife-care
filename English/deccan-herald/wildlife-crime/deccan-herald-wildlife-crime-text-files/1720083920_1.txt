The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Centre and Haryana government on a plea by 17-year-old Junaid Khan's father for a CBI probe into the killing of his son in train allegedly as part of a hate crime in June 2017.ADVERTISEMENTA bench of Justices Kurian Joseph and Mohan M Shantanagoudar also ordered for stay of the proceedings at the Faridabad court after Jalalludin, the victim's father, contended the investigation carried out by the Haryana police was "manipulated" to give it the shape of a conflict or a clash rather than a "sinister one-sided hate attack on helpless victims".Junaid, who had boarded a Mathura-bound train from Delhi on June 22, 2017, was reportedly stabbed to death when the train was nearing Ballabgarh in Haryana. He was returning home to Khandawali village along with his brothers and cousins after shopping in Delhi for Eid.Senior advocate R S Cheema, representing the petitioner, said the investigation was carried out in a "seemingly casual" and "shoddy" manner to protect the accused by invoking bailable  offences  against them.Junaid's father challenged the Punjab and Haryana High Court's order of November 27, 2017, that had said there appeared to be no "deliberate attempt" to derail the investigation in the matter and the case had no "national or international ramifications".
