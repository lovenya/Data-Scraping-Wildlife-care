Chandigarh: AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday dubbed the Narendra Modi government's fight against corruption a 'nautanki', saying those whom the BJP accuses of wrongdoing are rewarded with ministerial berths upon joining the party.ADVERTISEMENT Addressing a party event in Haryana's Rohtak, the Delhi chief minister also said that if someone has committed a 'huge sin or a crime' and joins the BJP, the officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax Department will never dare to even touch that person."Who are the corrupt? The corrupt are not those who have been nabbed by the ED and sent behind bars. The corrupt are those who joined the BJP due to ED's scare. Those who have been nabbed by the ED, but did not join the BJP, are fiercely honest. Because they know today or tomorrow they will come out," the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said.Also Read:'More dangerous to people than stifling air,' BJP slams CM Kejriwal for Delhi pollutionAlso Read:'More dangerous to people than stifling air,' BJP slams CM Kejriwal for Delhi pollution"But those who indulge in dishonesty, know that if they are arrested they will have to go to jail for life and immediately join the BJP. So, understand who is corrupt and who is honest," Kejriwal said. The ED had recently summoned Kejriwal for questioning in the alleged Delhi excise policy case and to record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Kejriwal on Thursday did not appear before the ED and wrote to the central agency demanding the 'recall' of its summons to him, calling it "vague, motivated and unsustainable in law". Targeting the BJP at the event, he said, 'They say they will arrest Kejriwal, I want to tell them you may arrest me, but how will you suppress my voice'."You arrest me, Modi ji shoot me, Kejriwal will die, but even in your sleep you will hear my voice and my voice will ring in your ears, my voice will not let you sleep peacefully," he said.
