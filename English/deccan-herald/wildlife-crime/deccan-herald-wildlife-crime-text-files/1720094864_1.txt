The CM also said his government will pay the fees of poor students taking admission in engineering and medical streams, provide a job to every family, supply LPG cylinders at Rs 450 each and waive inflated electricity bills. The Congress will never be able to give such benefits to people, Chouhan claimed. He said the Nath government, during its tenure from December 2018 to March 2020, had committed a 'sin' by stopping welfare schemes, including Rs 1,000 monthly assistance to Baiga, Bharia and Saharia tribals. Chouhan also addressed rallies in Sagar, Chhatarpur, Panna and Satna districts.
