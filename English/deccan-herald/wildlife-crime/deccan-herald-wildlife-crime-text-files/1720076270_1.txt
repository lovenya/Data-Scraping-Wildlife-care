In a major initiative, the first-ever regional Center for Species Survival (CSS) in South Asia has been established in India.ADVERTISEMENTThe International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission (SSC) and the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) have partnered to establish the centre. This will be the 10th Centre for Species Survival in the world and the first of its kind in South Asia, a press statement issued here said. The center hopes to provide a platform for conservation practitioners to network and share best practices, as well as to contribute to species status assessments using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and amplify the impact of species recovery efforts across the country. The centre will further act as a bridge between national and international efforts to save species.
