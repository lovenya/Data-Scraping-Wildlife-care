Radical changes are needed to counter white-collar crime in India, according to a white paper released by consultancy firm EY.

ADVERTISEMENT“Corporate India as well as the government need to join forces, and come together to tackle the current and imminent problems around white-collar crime. With the nature of such crimes becoming complex, piercing new sectors and becoming increasingly trans-border, there is a dire need to have more technologically advanced platforms to battle these risks,” the white paper said.

Investigators probing into such cases will therefore have to develop skill-sets that can enable them to not only understand the psyche of the perpetrator, but also regulations in different jurisdictions, it added.
