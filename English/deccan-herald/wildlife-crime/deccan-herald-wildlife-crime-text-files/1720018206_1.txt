'I believe that the manner of causing death and pouring inflammable material on the victims, and clod bloodedly lighting them up which included an old helpless lady and a small child of couple of years shows the dastardly act and classifies it as such,' the court said.'Society abhors such crimes which shock the conscience of the society and always attracts intense and extreme indignation of the community,' it noted. Jath had, in his defence, claimed he was irked with one of the victims who had used certain derogatory words against him.The court, however, said, 'Can that be said to be provocation or adequate provocation for committing such a ghastly act. I feel the answer lies in the question itself.'
