The earth is hard on the outskirts of this once princely state of Sivaganga, the onset of summer already telling.  Even tender coconuts are sparse as vast stretches of dry vegetation, mainly comprising low-growing shrubs and the prickly acacia’ species (“Karuvela maram” in Tamil), greet you into the Tirupathur reserve forests. These species are “forget-me-nots” in their own way, as a casual stretch of hands can bruise your palms red, either by acacia’s thorns or an unsuspecting cactus plant that spotted deer also feed on to slake their thirst.

The district itself boasts of 19,000 hectares of such dry forest cover, says Sivaganga District Forest Officer S L Gupta, whose jurisdiction runs up to far-away Rameshwaram. “Gosh!” his index finger goes up, as he cautions silence to his 
forest guards animatedly tracking deer hoofs and droppings.

That is a lesson in forest forensics for visitors. Some spotted deer have just gone by that place, as S R Palanichamy,  Forest Range Officer, Tirupathur Division, casually picks a small lot of their black seed-like droppings and gently crushes them with his fingers to bare its composition.

“Are these used as manure?”  No, not quite, murmurs Palanichamy. But they are the harbingers of a big hope for him and his team, including I Veerabadran, a veteran forest guard, K Ramachandran, a forester, M Dayalan, a forest watcher, and Souriraj,  priest of a local temple in the forest.

“The more deer droppings we notice in a day, more we feel elated as it vindicates our project,” says Palanichamy to a visiting Deccan Herald correspondent. The liberal droppings indicate that the spotted deer have had more than their daily water fill, he reasons. And this brings us to the heart of a small but hugely significant technological miracle in “Manmalai”.

With Sivaganga district being predominantly dry, its annual rainfall is around 750 mm, “We have to overcome a basic challenge to do any meaningful forestry and animal conservation,” explained Gupta. He hit upon a relatively low-cost, appropriate technology to create a reasonably permanent water source that can help to raise plantations and “at the same time using it for drinking water facilities for wild animals also.”

     Gupta, an IFS officer from Ranchi,  was shunted out of the sensitive Sathyamangalam to this “desert posting” in arid Ramad region as he courageously took on the political powers linked to sandalwood smuggling six years back. On coming here, he thought of a simple, yet appropriate technological solution for it.

“Within the limited resources, at a cost of Rs 2.5 lakh, we have now provided this water-yielding infrastructure,” said Gupta who has already raised about 1,000 hectares of teak plantations in this bone-dry belt. We tip-toed the forest terrain without stirring a leaf, only to reach a small building ringed by thick plant-growth, including jungle lemons. A roof-mounted solar power panel (comprising 12 panels) opens up sky-wards with the room beneath housing safety equipment, battery and battery rechargers and a submersible pump tubed to a bore well. Using solar power, water is pumped out, which then flows automatically by gravitational force.

The bore water is taken through sub-surface pipes to two water troughs built in two different directions, said Gupta on how solar power aids water availability at the forest site. Both the troughs cover a radius of about 5 km of forest area, where the water is stored for the animals to come and drink. Though the “energy conversion rate”  by the Indian-made solar panels is only about 9 per cent, which in efficiency terms is still low, Gupta explained that it drives the motor for half-an-hour daily and eminently served the purpose for which it has been designed.

“This is the first structure of its kind in Tamil Nadu,” said Gupta, naming it  “Prototype I”.  “We can have improved versions of this prototype, which is well suited for dry terrains of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and parts of Gangetic plains,” Gupta added. And this micro-irrigation facility driven by solar power hardly has maintenance costs. How does  Gupta’s out-of-the-box approach help both tree planting and animal conservation? “There is no point in raising large tree plantations without watering facilities,” says Gupta who has sent a plan to the Tamil Nadu Government for scaling up this model using abundantly available solar power to meet the water needs of both forestry and animal conservation. 

Gupta strongly believes that what has been kick-started in Sivaganga district can be replicated nation-wide. Before this facility was set up, spotted deer strayed out of the forest area in search of water and many of them got killed in vehicle accidents, or when they slipped into village ponds or open wells. Some were even attacked by dogs in the villages, he said.

This led to a drastic reduction in the spotted deer population in Manmalai. Now in recent months, “sightings of spotted deer and other wild animals have considerably increased,” he avers.

 Range Forest officer Palanichamy, on a rough count by his men recently, says the spotted deer tribe would now be at least 500-strong, besides scores of peacocks returning to the Manmalai reserved forest, due to the availability of a reliable water source, particularly in summer months. Also, about 40 pythons caught in Sivaganga’s villages in recent months now freely snarl across these forests, he points out to drive home how this solar-power based infrastructure has yielded dividends for wildlife preservation.

“As this is a forest area, I wanted a self-sufficient source of power, that is stand-alone and not grid-dependent; and also something that makes no noise as higher decibel levels drives away the animals,” Gupta said putting his project of this solar power-based water facility in perspective. He hopes this will be an eco-friendly technology-demonstrator for the nation.
