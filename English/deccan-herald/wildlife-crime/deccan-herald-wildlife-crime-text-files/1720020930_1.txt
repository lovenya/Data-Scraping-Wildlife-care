They include Saudi Arabia, Argentina and Egypt.China, seeking to expand its geopolitical influence as it tussles with the United States, has said it "welcomes more like-minded partners to join the 'BRICS family' at an early date."Russia also supports expansion, while Brazil resists it, fearing the already unwieldy club could see its stature diluted by it.
