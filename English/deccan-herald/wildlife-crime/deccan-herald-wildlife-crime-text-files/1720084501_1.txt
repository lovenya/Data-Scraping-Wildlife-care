Italy's supreme court has ruled that it is a criminal offence to tell a man he has "no balls" because it hurts male pride.

ADVERTISEMENTIn a case between two cousins, brought to the court by a lawyer named Vittorio against his cousin Alberto, the apex court said the insult that a man has "no balls" is a crime punishable with a fine, the Daily Mail reported.

The phrase was uttered during a heated courtroom exchange in the southern Italian city of Potenza. "Apart from the vulgarity of the term used, the expression definitely also has an injurious quality," said Judge Maurizio Fumo.

"It refers not only to the target's lack of virility, but also to his weakness of character, lack of determination, competence and coherence - virtues that, rightly or wrongly, are still identified as pertaining to the male gender," he said.

The court also said that uttering the insult at the workplace with third parties present could also damage one's reputation.
