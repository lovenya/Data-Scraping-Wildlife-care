His message is clear - he will bring a law through the Parliament to overturn whichever Supreme Court order he does not like. It is a very dangerous situation if the prime minister does not follow the Supreme Court,' Kejriwal said on X.'The Supreme Court had formed an impartial committee which will select impartial election commissioners. The prime minister by overturning the Supreme Court has formed a committee that will be under his control, and he could make a person of his liking election commissioner through it. It will influence impartiality of elections,' he said and alleged that 'the prime minister is weakening Indian democracy through decision after decision'.In another post, he wrote the committee proposed for selection of election commissioners will have 'two BJP and one Congress members'. 'Obviously the selected election commissioner will be loyal to the BJP,' AAP leader said.The government has listed the bill for introduction to regulate the appointment, conditions of service and term of office of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.
