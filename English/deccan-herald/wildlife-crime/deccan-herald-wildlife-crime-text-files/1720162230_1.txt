Congress has not engaged in hate politics. The Congress has been respecting the leader of the opposition. None of the BJP leaders are speaking on the grants that are pending to be released from the state. Instead, they are engaged in misleading people through their statements."Legal advisor to CM and MLA A S Ponnanna said “we are in favour of Ram Mandir. Even the Chief Minister has also said the same. We wish for the inauguration of Ram Mandir. BJP is levelling allegations for political purposes."“Crimes were not reviewed during the BJP tenure. Steps had to be taken to end the 31-year-old case. No steps were taken to arrest Karsevaks for the sake of arresting them. It is not right to add political colour to the legal process,” he added.
