Days after Anjali was killed after she was reportedly dragged for over 12 kilometres under a vehicle, uncle of the deceased and a few others sit outside Sultanpuri Police Station in Delhi on January 10. Her uncle said, “SHO told us he’ll make us speak with DCP, adding sec 302 (murder) not in his hands but that of seniors. If accused confessed to the crime, what else does Police want to see?”ADVERTISEMENT
