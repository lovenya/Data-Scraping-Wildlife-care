When the court asked the MLA if he had anything to say on the conviction, he replied that he 'had not done anything wrong'. Special public prosecutor Sumesh Panjwani, appearing for police, sought maximum punishment, while the defence said imposing maximum punishment should not be a straight jacket formula and that the conduct of the accused should be considered. It is their first offence and they are good people, hence, the court must give them minimum punishment, the defence argued. As per the case details, the assault on BMC officials took place in Punjabi Colony and the accused led a mob of 1000-1200 persons, which would be controlled only after police reinforcements were rushed in.
