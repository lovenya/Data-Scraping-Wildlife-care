The Crime Branch of the Kerala Police is set to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of a married woman by five priests from the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.ADVERTISEMENTDirector General of Police (DGP) Loknath Behera issued an order in this connection on Friday.The woman’s husband, a member of the Niranam diocese in Pathanamthitta district, had complained to the Church authorities in May.The woman is alleged to have confessed before a priest about a pre-marital relationship she had with another priest.According to the complainant, details of the secret confession were used by the priest and the others to intimidate and sexually exploit her.Even after the Kottayam-headquartered Church placed the five priests under suspension pending an internal probe, the police did not register a case since no formal complaint was filed.On Thursday, members of the church panel recorded the complainant’s statement. The woman is yet to appear before the probe panel.On Wednesday, the National Commission for Women directed the DGP to investigate the matter and apprise the commission about the action taken.Former chief minister and state Administrative Reforms Commission Chairman V S Achuthanandan had also demanded registration of a case.
