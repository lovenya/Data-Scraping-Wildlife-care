India has voted against Sri Lanka in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and backed a resolution that urged the island nation to “credibly investigate” allegations of war crimes by its armed forces during the military crackdown on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2009.

soothe the ruffled feathers in Colombo.Twenty-four members of the 47-nation UNHRC voted in favour of the resolution, while 15 countries came out in support of Sri Lanka and voted against the resolution.

Eight member-nations of the UNHRC abstained from voting. The countries that voted against the resolution included China, which has been trying to increase its presence in and influence over Sri Lanka and has also been developing the strategic footprints in the Indian Ocean region, much to the concerns of India. Pakistan, Bangladesh and Russia too voted in favour of Sri Lanka.

“We don't want to infringe on Sri Lanka’s sovereignty, but our concerns should be expressed so that Tamils get justice and dignity,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told journalists after New Delhi voted against Colombo.

Under pressure from both the main political parties of Tamil Nadu –the ruling All-India 
Anna Dravida Munnethra Kazhagam and the Congress’ ally Dravida Munnethra Kazhagam – Singh had earlier told the Lok Sabha that India was inclined to vote in favour of the resolution on Sri Lanka.

Singh on Thursday said that India’s vote against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC was in line with its stand and wanted to ensure that its concern was expressed to help minority Tamils in that country get justice.

“While we subscribe to the broader message of this resolution and the objectives it promotes, we also underline that any assistance from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights or visits of UN Special Procedures should be in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Sri Lankan government,” India said in its Explanation of Vote in the UNHRC.

Sri Lanka had on Tuesday requested India to review its decision to vote in favour of the resolution against it in the UNHRC. 

But with the DMK threatening to pull out of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, External Affairs Minister S M Krishna had recently reiterated India’s position to his Sri Lankan counterpart G L Peiris.

India, however, got the US make two significant changes in the text of the draft resolution, which was introduced and put to vote on Thursday at the ongoing 19th session of the UNHRC in Geneva.
