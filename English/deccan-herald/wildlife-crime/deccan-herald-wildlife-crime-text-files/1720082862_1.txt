A dispute over distribution of "extorted" money among cops in Noida (Gautam Buddh Nagar district) brought to light the commission charged by the police, causing an embarrassment to the Uttar Pradesh government.ADVERTISEMENTIt also revealed that the criminals were able to get their names off the encounter list by bribing the cops.The entire crime branch of the Noida police was dissolved following the revelation on the direction of the state police chief and all the cops were sent to the lines.According to sources, Sanjiv Teotia, a cop in the crime branch, who had a dispute with his colleague over the distribution of the commission, uploaded the entire rate card of the Noida police on the social networking sites.It contained the names of businessmen and criminals who regularly paid money to the cops and also the names of the officials ranging from the superintendent of police down to the constables among whom the money was distributed.Shocked by the public exposure, an embarrassed DGP office ordered an inquiry into the matter and directed the Noida SSP to dissolve the crime branch and sent the cops to the lines.Barely a few days back BJP MLA from Agra, Jagan Prasad Garg, had written a letter to the chief minister regarding a similar commission rate list of the Agra municipal corporation officials for doing different works. Garg had demanded action against the erring officials but no action has so far been taken.
