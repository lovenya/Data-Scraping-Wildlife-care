'A major chunk of the robbed jewellery was recovered from them. A search is on for the other members of the gang. Hopefully, we will arrest them soon,' a police officer of Ranaghat said. In Purulia, a gang of eight people robbed the jewellery store. It is estimated that gold and diamonds worth Rs 7 crore were robbed by them, police said. It is suspected that a trans-border gang was involved in the robbery, they said. Jewellers usually stock up ahead of the festive season, which sees a surge in demand.
