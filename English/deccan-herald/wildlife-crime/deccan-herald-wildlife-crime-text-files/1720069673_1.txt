Out of these 24 felines, eight including three cubs have died.On July 16, the environment ministry said five out of the 20 adult cheetahs brought from Namibia and South Africa died due to natural causes and media reports attributing the deaths to factors like radio collars were based on "speculation and hearsay without scientific evidence". The ministry also said several steps have been planned to support the cheetah project, including the establishment of a Cheetah Research Center with facilities for rescue, rehabilitation, capacity building, and interpretation.On July 20, the Supreme Court said the death of eight cheetahs in the KNP in less than one year doesn't present a "good picture", and asked the Centre to not make it a prestige issue and explore the possibility of shifting the animals to different sanctuaries.
