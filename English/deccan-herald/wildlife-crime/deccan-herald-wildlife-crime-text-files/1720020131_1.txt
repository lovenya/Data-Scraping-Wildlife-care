Kukis and Meiteis in Manipur are already living in separate areas now. So separate administration and livelihood opportunities are needed so that Kukis can live peacefully," Lupho said.Activists from local organisations such as Bahutva Karnataka expressed their solidarity to the victims, at the event.
