Bengaluru: A 32-year-old woman and her 16-year-old son, along with his friend, have been implicated in multiple chain snatchings, according to the police. The woman, identified as Roja Nagaraj, accused of masterminding the crimes to earn more money, allegedly coerced her son—already linked to over 12 cases—into these crimes.ADVERTISEMENTThe trio targeted residents of Western Bengaluru during early morning hours, particularly those wearing gold, using observations Roja made during her 5 am walks. The minors, employing a stolen scooter for their thefts, snatched chains under Roja's guidance, who then sold the loot in Nagarathpet and pawned some at a finance institution.Also Read:Woman hacked to death in Bengaluru's Kaggalipura Also Read:Woman hacked to death in Bengaluru's Kaggalipura The Annapoorneshwari Nagar police arrested Roja, uncovering her role in influencing the minors towards criminal activities, leading to five cases being filed against them.
