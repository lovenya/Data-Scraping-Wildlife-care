Crime Branch officials on Thursday interrogated BJP's member in the Rajya Sabha and actor Suresh Gopi, in connection with the MP's alleged evasion of motor vehicle tax as he registered two of his luxury cars in Puducherry.ADVERTISEMENTEarlier this month, Suresh Gopi was booked under charges of cheating and forgery following allegations that he used a fake residential address to register his cars in the Union Territory and, in turn, evade 20% tax in Kerala on cars priced Rs 20 lakh and above.The questioning lasted a couple of hours and the MP is learnt to have submitted to investigating officials documents validating registration of his vehicles and details of his temporary address in Puducherry.The Kerala High Court, considering an anticipatory bail plea by the MP on Friday, deferred his arrest for three weeks and directed him to appear for interrogation. Suresh Gopi has maintained that he registered his vehicles in Puducherry because he owned agricultural land around the UT and the registration was done by providing details of a flat he has leased there.The Crime Branch has also booked actors Fahadh Faasil and Amala Paul for evasion of tax by registering their luxury cars in Puducherry. On Thursday, the Alappuzha District and Sessions Court granted anticipatory bail to Fahadh. Following reports on tax evasion, the actor had paid Rs 17.68 lakh in tax.Reports about residents of other states registering their high-end vehicles in Puducherry have surfaced over many years. In November, Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi ordered an investigation into the matter.
