											A scene that many say looks straight out of JRR Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'. A wildlife explorer hit jackpot when he spotted a rare white moose out in the wild in the Swedish province of Varmland.

Hans Nilsson, who shot the incredible viral footage, said he spent three years looking for the animal and couldn't believe his luck when he chanced upon the animal drinking from a river. The next day, he went back to the same spot with his camera and there it was!

"You see the white moose go down into the water, take some chimps forward, climb on the other side and then bite some leaves and then turn to me and look straight into the camera," he told The Independent about the video.

The original post by Mr Nilsson has over half a million views.
