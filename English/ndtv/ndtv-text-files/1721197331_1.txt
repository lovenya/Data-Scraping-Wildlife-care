											It took 30 hours to catch a leopard on the loose inside Maruti's factory at Manesar near Delhi. Late this afternoon, wildlife officials tranquilized the leopard and said it will later be released into the wild.

The skittish leopard managed to evade nearly 100 police and forest officials carrying tranquilliser guns inside the factory at Manesar, which went into lockdown after it was spotted lurking around by security guards early Thursday.

 "Many teams of police and forest guards are searching for the leopard. We have cordoned off the entire complex," said Ashok Bakshi, a deputy commissioner of police in Manesar, roughly 30 miles from the capital during the search yesterday.

Workers were evacuated from the Maruti Suzuki plant which covers nearly 600 kms and is the largest in India churning out nearly a million vehicles a year.
