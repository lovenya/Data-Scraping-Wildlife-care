											South African officials say game rangers killed three poachers in the past week in an escalation of armed incursions into South Africa's flagship wildlife reserve, where hundreds of rhinos have been killed for their horns this year.

Paul Daphne, a spokesman for South Africa's national parks service, said Saturday that poaching activity in Kruger National Park has traditionally increased in November and December before tapering off around the year-end holiday season.
