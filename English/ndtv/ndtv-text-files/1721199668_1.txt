The animal jumped onto the vehicle and stunned touristsNew Delhi: The wildlife has grown so accustomed to the presence of vehicles in many popular safari locations, particularly in Africa, that it usually ignores them, allowing tourists to view the magnificence of these animals up close.In one such video, shared on Twitter by Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Surender Mehra, a cheetah is seen boarding a jeep that was ferrying tourists around a park on a safari. The animal even jumped onto the vehicle, and the stunned tourists began filming it up-close.The animal first appears in the clip clambering up onto the vehicle's spare wheel mounted at the rear. The big cat then climbs inside the vehicle. The animal quickly ascends to the vehicle's roof and begins scanning the area from its new vantage point.Also ReadWatch: Cheetah 'Gamini', Her 5 Cubs Enjoy Rain At Kuno National ParkFrom Goat Meat Row To Pay, Why Kuno's Cheetah-Trackers Are On StrikeVideo: Tiger Growls, Lunges To Attack Tourist Vehicle At Jim Corbett National ParkPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comMr Mehra also tagged IFS officer Susanta Nanda, who regularly shares videos of animals in the wild.Watch the video here:Man in Wild ..#WildlifeTourism#AnimalBehaviour#Cheetah ???? @susantananda3pic.twitter.com/QbQ223eiEJ— Surender Mehra IFS (@surenmehra) July 2, 2022So far, the video has been viewed over 13,000 times, with many people even commenting on it.

Great video though.— Ranvir Deb (@ranvir_deb) July 2, 2022These cheetahs climb the vehicles likely for the same reason they might climb a tree — it's a good vantage point and a high place to scent-mark. Highlighting this fact, one user wrote, “The cheetah now has a wonderful viewing platform, which can be moved as needed.”The Cheetah now has a wonderful viewing platform, which can be moved as needed :)— Mira S.
