											One of the world's rarest animals -- a white bison -- has been born at Belgrade zoo, officials said.

The calf, named Dusanka, was born on Monday and trotted around her enclosure in "good health", according to the zoo's veterinarian. 

"According to my information, no other (American) white bison has been born in Europe," veterinarian Jozef Ezvedj told AFP.
