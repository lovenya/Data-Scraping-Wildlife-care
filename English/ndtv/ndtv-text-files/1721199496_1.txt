The cheetah tries to bite through the wired fence, but the effort goes in vain.The deer, with three legs, evens brings its mouth very close to the big cat to bite off the leaves.“I want the confidence of this deer in my life!” a user said in a tweet response to the video.“That (deer) has more intelligent than (cheetah). It can understand barriers between them,” said another.Users were also surprised that the big cat was not able to jump over the fence. Some suggested that there is electric fence on top.The video was posted by the IFS officer on Saturday, March 12, and has been viewed more than 66,000 times since then. Mr Nanda has not specified the location where the video was shot but it looks like a sanctuary where wild animals are kept in open-air enclosures.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comA few days ago, a video of a stare down between a sloth bear and a tiger won the hearts of people.
