											On the occasion of 'Wildlife Safety Week', the Haryana government has started a scheme for adoption of wild animals in zoos and deer parks for their conservation and protection

"Awareness would be created among people for adoption of wild animals in zoos and deer parks," an official spokesperson said today.

During the 'Wildlife Safety Week' which is being observed from October 1 to 7, the Forest Department has decided to organise a number of programmes through which people would be motivated for conservation of wild animals, he said.

Self Help Groups would be constituted for participation of women in wildlife conservation, which would also increase their income, the spokesperson said.

"During 'Wildlife Safety Week', everyone should pledge to conserve wildlife. There is a lot of pressure on forest land due to population increase in the state. Forest areas around villages have been turned into agricultural land," he said.

"Forests are inhabited by several types of creatures, which are necessary for maintaining ecological balance," the spokesperson added.
