											To the strains of upbeat jazz and with a vegetable cake laid on as a special treat, Canola the Singaporean manatee celebrated her third birthday in style on Wednesday.

The nearly 300-kilogram (660-pound) manatee swam around in a large aquarium as a three-piece jazz band played at a party attended by dozens of schoolchildren. 

Divers swam in carrying a two-metre (6.5-feet) high "cake" made of sweet potato leaves and carrot and topped off with a "C" fashioned from cabbage, as the guests sang 'Happy Birthday'.

The festivities were joined by the other 12 manatees in Canola's herd, who jostled for bites of the cake in the aquarium.
