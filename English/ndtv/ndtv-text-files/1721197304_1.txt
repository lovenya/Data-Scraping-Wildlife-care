											Who says cats are not friendly? Little Alan here is so friendly he's made friends with long-tailed macaques! The unlikely friendship has sprung up at the Wildlife Friends Foundation in Thailand (WFFT), where Alan, a stray cat, has found a best friend in Jo Jo, a rescued long-tailed macaque. Tom Taylor, Assistant Director of the foundation, told NDTV that Alan had been "hanging around" for a few months now, living within the macaque field, but it was only last week that they noticed him interacting with Jo Jo.

"They spend time up on the platforms in the enclosure, relaxing, sleeping and grooming each other," says Mr Taylor.
