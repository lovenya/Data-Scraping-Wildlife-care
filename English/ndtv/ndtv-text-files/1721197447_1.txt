My father moved to Africa about a year ago for work, for its stunning golf courses, quality of life and the proximity to Tanzania because he's a wildlife enthusiast. I visited him in October last year and we spent a week in the Tanzanian wilderness. The first part of our trip was spent at Four Seasons Serengeti where we got really lucky on our first game drive. After spotting the Big 5 in the first two hours, we caught a glimpse of a young mother (cheetah) going after a gazelle right after dusk. My friends who had visited the Serengeti the previous year were raving about the hot air balloon at dawn, and I couldn't just take their word for it so I decided to try it myself.

I knew we had to wake up at the crack of dawn so I charged the cameras and phones and put my eye mask before I fell asleep. We were woken up at 4:15 and while I'm not a morning person, I poured ourselves a cup of coffee and grabbed some berries as we left the property. The air was crisp and cool and my tummy was whirling with excitement at the prospect of everything we were going to see. We had a fairly good vantage point when we arrived into the Serengeti as the Cessnas tried to land while zebras were still scrambling to get off the runway but nothing could prepare us for what we were about to experience. A post shared by Jia-Wandering for Wellness (@jiasingh) on Oct 15, 2017 at 3:45am PDTADVERTISEMENT  A post shared by Jia-Wandering for Wellness (@jiasingh) on Oct 14, 2017 at 9:42am PDTADVERTISEMENT The drive to the woods from our hotel was about 45 minutes and while most people are struggling to stay awake, I was very alert and excited, presumably from all the coffee. I grabbed an extra jacket from the car and we got on after we heard the safety instructions. The pilot was very experienced and a wildlife enthusiast like my father, so they had a great time talking on our way up. The sky started to change colours and the trees looked so beautiful as we started to climb higher and higher. My father and I were hellbent on documenting every minute of the experience with our DSLR and phone cameras but gave up after a while because we wanted to soak in the experience instead.


After flying over herds of zebras, antelope and many giraffes, I had a deepened admiration towards the delicate ecosystem that makes the Serengeti thrive. After we returned to the hotel to retreat to the rooms for a short nap. I couldn't help but marvel at the experience and the abundance that surrounds the forests of Tanzania. A post shared by Jia-Wandering for Wellness (@jiasingh) on Oct 8, 2017 at 12:12am PDT A little bit about the safari-


The experience at dawn is sought after by most people visiting the Serengeti because it provides a unique vantage point for viewing the animals. Most flights last approximately 1 hour, are dependent on weather conditions and are usually followed by a champagne bush breakfast. For safety reasons, this activity is limited to children of seven years and older.


The pilot and support staff are kind, skilled and experienced and always go out of their way to ensure each guest has a memorable experience. Each flight is unique and most guests prefer to talk less and keep their eyes peeled on the treetops and the ground to avoid missing the animals in action. Although not a cheap excursion, it will undoubtedly be one of the most incredible experiences of your life. It is also possible for guests to charter special private balloon flights for honeymooners or to a commemorate a special occasion.

Tips-


Wear comfortable clothes and bring a light woolen cardigan or windcheater. Don't forget to cover your arms and legs or you might risk getting bitten by the flies, and it does sting. Please carry your binoculars, cameras and keep your phones on silent so as to not disturb the animals.

Verdict-


Although this ride comes at a price, I highly recommend a balloon safari for the wildlife enthusiast, young couples and people who love the outdoors for breathtaking landscapes and an indulgent experience you'll never forget. (Jia Singh is a travel and wellness writer.
