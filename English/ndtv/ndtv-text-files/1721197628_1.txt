											A Florida woman is believed to be dead after an alligator attack in Davie, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

Investigators killed a 12-foot alligator that was captured near the scene of the woman's disappearance and found evidence that the reptile had bitten the woman. Local broadcaster WPLG reported that a human arm was found inside the animal.

FWC spokesman Rob Klepper identified the woman as 47-year-old Shizuka Matsuki, of Plantation, Florida.

A witness saw Matsuki walking two dogs and contacted police when they saw the dogs alone and unattended, according to FWC.

"[Matsuki's] dogs won't leave the pond," Davie Police Maj. Dale Engle told the Sun-Sentinel. "One of her dogs got bit by the gator."
