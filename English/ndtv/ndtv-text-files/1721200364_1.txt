But everyone else seemed to hate them,” she shared.Wildlife biologist Dr. Purnima Devi Barman (@StorkSister) has been conferred with the prestigious @WhitleyAwards 2024, known as the ‘Green Oscar', in recognition of her outstanding efforts to protect the endangered greater adjutant stork (Hargila) and its wetland habitat.

Changing attitudes and galvanising local people, primarily women, to safeguard nests, and working with her team at the local wildlife NGO Aaranyak, their numbers have now quadrupled to more than 1,800.“Her project aims to grow community-driven conservation initiatives to bolster the number of Greater Adjutant breeding pairs, expanding support of local women to grow the ‘Hargila Army' of ‘Stork sister' advocates. She will also establish a collaborative network of WFN alumni, students, scientists and policymakers, providing conservation education and promoting a knowledge exchange programme,” the WFN said.The Whitley Awards also celebrated six other grassroots conservationists – from Guyana, Papua New Guinea, Bhutan, Cameroon, Nepal and Brazil – for their locally-led solutions to the global biodiversity and climate crises.Also ReadBear Cub With Head Stuck In Plastic Container Rescued In US, Internet HappyMs Barman wants to double the global population of the bird to 5,000 by 2030, working across the stork's range in India and Cambodia, through a series of scale-up measures.A mother to teenage twin daughters, Ms Barman added ''When children accompany their mothers in the Hargila Army, it imbues our mission with deeper meaning.'' According to experts, the Hargila brings value to the landscapes that it inhabits, including through its penchant for consuming decaying organic matter. With a wingspan of 2.4 metres, the Hargila can reach 1.2 metres in height. They build nests that are expanded to as large as 1 meter wide as the chicks grow.Far from negatively impacting the hygiene of its environment, the bird plays a vital role in nutrient recycling and maintaining ecosystem health. The storks are an essential ecological pillar in Assam's wetlands which comprise more than 15 per cent of the state, the experts said.Ms Barman's scale-up efforts will involve providing conservation education to more than 20,000 Assamese students and a knowledge exchange programme between students at Bihar University and the University of Assam.The awards are won competitively following a global search and rigorous application process, assessed by an expert judging panel and winners receive GBP 50,000 in project funding over one year, in addition to elevated profile, new connections and training.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe winners also will join a community of over 200 Whitley Award alumni – a network of peers across the Global South with whom they can share expertise, resources and support. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)
