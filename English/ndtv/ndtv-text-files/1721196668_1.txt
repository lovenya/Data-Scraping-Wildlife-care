											A lion attacked and injured a 63-year-old man Friday after straying out of the Nairobi National Park onto one of the country's major highways during peak morning traffic, a Kenyan wildlife official said.

Paul Udoto, a Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman, said the lion attacked the man after becoming agitated by motorists honking their horns at the animal before it was captured.

A video circulating on social media appears to show the lion running on a sidewalk as the horns honked.

Officials did not immediately say if the man was badly hurt.
