Authorities had tried in vain for years to bag the crocodile, which is estimated to be 60 years old.Following a nearly decade-long hunt, a massive saltwater crocodile has been captured in northern Australia, according to wildlife authorities.Rangers caught the crocodile Monday after setting a trap on a private property near Katherine, a town in Northern Territory, Australia.The evasive crocodile is said to be one of the largest trapped in the region, which is not far from the Nitmiluk and Kakadu national parks. It was estimated to be about 60 years old, but it is the reptile's size that is shocking - measuring more than 15 feet long (the average length of a car) and weighing more than 1,300 pounds (which is more than a grand piano), according to the Katherine Times."It is a bit of a thrill," wildlife ranger John Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corp., "but you've also got to admire the size of the animal and how old it is. You've got to have a bit of respect for it."Rangers had been on the lookout for the giant creature since it was first seen nearly 10 years ago.In May, rangers saw three crocodiles while surveying the land, according to the Katherine Times. A trap was then set a couple weeks ago near Katherine River - and the crocodile, dubbed "big fella," swam right into it.A smaller crocodile, measuring almost eight feet, was also captured, according to the newspaper.Ranger Chris Heydon told the Katherine Times that once in the trap, the giant reptiles are sedated, "so there is no chance of us getting chomped."The crocodile, a male, was "removed" to "help prevent human interaction in the more populated areas," the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife said in a Facebook post.Also ReadAustralian Missing Child's Remains Found After Suspected Crocodile AttackWatch: Crocodile Seen On Maharashtra Road After Heavy RainDog-Eating Crocodile That Terrorised Australian Village Killed And Cooked For FeastThe post included a photo showing the crocodile tied down on a trailer with duct tape around its jaw.
