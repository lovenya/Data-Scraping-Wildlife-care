											Here's a little lesson in will power you didn't know you needed. A wildlife enthusiast has captured stunning and rare footage of a tiger on a tree, hoping to catch his prey, a monkey.

The video, shared on the Corbett Wild-Ventures Facebook page, shows the tiger high up on the tree, ready to pounce on his lunch. The monkey can be seen swinging slightly away on the same branch, literally hanging on for dear life. Tigers are not known to climb trees unless they're provoked or extremely hungry. Or if they are Shere Khan.

The intense footage shows the predator and prey engaging in a staring match of sorts, both probably trying to figure out the best next move to make. Then, what seems like an eternity later, the tiger finally takes a light step forward. This is when the monkey seizes the opportunity to jump onto a different branch of the tree but not before completely shaking up the branch the tiger stands on.
