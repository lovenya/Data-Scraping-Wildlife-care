											Asiatic lions in Gujarat's Gir forests are facing threat from poachers, government today said quoting a study by a wildlife monitoring agency.

Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar also informed Rajya Sabha that "there is a persistent challenge" for conservation of leopards in view of high ongoing seizure rate averaging 3.5 cases of seizures related to leopard per month since 2000.

The seizure rate has been assessed by analysing the database developed by TRAFFIC (an international organisation), which is based on news reports and government records, he said.

"The report also indicates threat to the population of African lion as well as to the only population of Asiatic lion, found in India, due to illegal trade in lion body parts for medicinal purposes," the minister said in a written reply.
