											A Nilgai caused a stir on Thursday in one of Delhi's most protected zones, not far from the Prime Minister's Office and other ministries. It took over two hours to catch the animal, which is believed to have strayed from a forest area in the back of the President's Estate

The Nilgai was spotted lurking near a fountain at Vijay Chowk, the crossing that is encircled by top government offices and the Parliament House, early this morning.

A group of policemen rushed to remove the animal before VIP convoys of ministers and top officers started moving.

As policemen chased it, the animal suddenly darted across the road and was hit by a car. It was injured in the leg.

Officials explained that they had to be careful as the Nilgai has a "very delicate heart" and cannot be chased back to the forest and "had to be rescued".

"The Nilgai was tactfully cornered and then slowly taken into confidence. After medical recovery, it will be sent to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary here," an officer told the Press Trust of India.
