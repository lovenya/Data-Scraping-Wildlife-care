											An extraordinary sight caught on camera: two deer, up on their hind legs, battling it out, reportedly over food. The unusual sight was captured by wildlife officers at the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, or TWRA, and a short 10-second clip was posted to TWRA's Facebook page on Thursday.

The deer, identified as white-tailed bucks, can be seen engaged in a rather vicious fight, hitting out at each other with their front hooves. According to TWRA, bucks form "bachelor groups" when their antlers are growing and testosterone levels are low around this time of the year. Growing antlers are sensitive and bucks are very protective of them during this time, choosing instead to spar with their hooves, says TWRA.
  

"Amy and Bubba think these two bucks were working out their issues over a small food plot in Hardeman County," writes TWRA on Facebook.

Anytime you get two animals the same size like that nobody wants to back down," wildlife officer Bubba Spencer, one of the officers who shot the video, explains to WMC Action News 5. "I think if it would have been a bigger food plot I don't think it would have been an issue."
