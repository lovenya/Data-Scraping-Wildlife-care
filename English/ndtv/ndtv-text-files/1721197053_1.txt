											An eight-foot-long Indian Rock Python was today rescued by the Wildlife SOS Rapid Response Unit from the engine of a water tanker at the Barapullah Corridor extension site.

The constrictor was kept under observation for a few hours after which it was released into its natural habitat.

Construction workers at the Barapullah Corridor extension site found the snake trapped inside the engine of a water tanker.

Fearing for their safety as well as the well-being of the constrictor, they immediately reported the incident to the supervising authorities who in turn contacted Wildlife SOS.

"After ensuring that the crowd of curious onlookers was at a safe distance, we managed to carry out the rescue operation. It took almost 40 minutes for the rescuers to carefully extricate the distressed python," Wildlife SOS said.
