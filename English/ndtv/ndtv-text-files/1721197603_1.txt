Ask anyone to describe Assam and the first thing people often say is that "it's so green". The beautiful valley in northeast India is an absolute paradise for nature lovers. It has umpteen national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, making it the perfect getaway to experience wildlife at its best. Then there's of course the craze of spotting the one-horned rhinoceros - the only place in India where you can witness the majestic beasts in their natural habitat - as well as tigers, leopards, wild elephants, bears and numerous migratory birds.
So if Assam has been on your travel wishlist and you've been wanting to experience all that greenery while camping by the mighty Brahmaputra, now would be a good time to start planning your trip. The best time to visit Assam is from October to March when the weather is pleasant. Since most of the good hotels and resorts get booked way in advance, you need to plan accordingly.(Also read: 11 Hill Stations In Uttarakhand For A Perfect Summer Holiday)ADVERTISEMENTAssam provides a range of wildlife destinations for all sorts of travellers.
