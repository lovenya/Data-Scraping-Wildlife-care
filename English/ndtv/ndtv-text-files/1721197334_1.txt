											The Rashtrapati Bhavan had an unusual visitor on Friday when an injured monkey decided to take up temporary residence inside the President's house. The injured animal was spotted in a meeting room by the staff at Rashtrapati Bhavan and the matter was reported to the Wildlife SOS team on their 24-hour rescue helpline.

A two-member rescue team was immediately dispatched by the charity, which provides animal ambulance services to wild animals in distress across the Delhi NCR region. 

The Wildlife SOS team found the injured monkey resting under some chairs. 

"Our team has to be careful while extricating injured animals so as to avoid causing further stress or pain," explained Wasim Akram of Wildlife SOS Special Projects.
