If you have the soul of a wanderer but haven't yet explored Northeast India, it's about time you change that. With lust greenery and picturesque sights, Northeast India is not just stunning but unexplored too, and probably that's what makes it a great holiday destination to soak in the best of nature sans the crowd. And one of the top picks is Assam, known as the land of the one-horned rhinoceros and tea gardens, but also so much more than that.
If Assam has been on your travel itinerary for this year, think no further and start making your plans already. The best time to visit is from October to February, and it's always advisable to make your reservations well in advance. To help you get started, here's a list of 10 places you should visit while in Assam:1. Spot the rhino at KazirangaFor wildlife lovers, Kaziranga National Park is a must because here is where you can spot the one-horned rhinoceros in India. Sign up for the thrilling elephant safari, laze around in a luxurious resort and enjoy the slow life.

Get a glimpse of Ahom Dynasty at SibsagarFor those who love old architecture or history, Sibsagar is a must-visit to witness what remains of the Ahom Dynasty - Rong Ghar, Talatal Ghar, Shiva Dol, etc.Distance from Jorhat: 60 km Ruined yet so beautiful. If you love old architecture and tales of kings and queens then this little town in Assam is worth a visit. Sibsagar, the capital city of Ahom dynasty, has many historical structures to explore. This one has been my favourite - Kareng Ghor aka Tolatol Ghor. It may look basic, but is actually a 7-storied fort - 4 underground with endless tunnels designed as a maze. It is said that one even leads to the sea, probably the Brahmaputra, at that time. The upper floors are referred to as Kareng Ghor, which is open for public, as well as the ground floor. . . #assam #assamtrackmind #assamtourism #travel #northeast #northeastindia #travelandliving #instatravel #nofilter #wednesday #sibsagar #ahom #tolatolghor #karengghor #awesomeassam #traveller #instatravel #instalove #wanderlust #wanderer #cntravellerA post shared by  Plavaneeta Borah (@plavaneeta_borah) on Aug 2, 2017 at 6:54am PDT 4.
