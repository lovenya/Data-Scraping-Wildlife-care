When they include the wildlife, they get more interesting. A riddle is now doing the rounds on the Internet, showing – One…Two…leopards? First posted on Twitter by Mohan Thomas, a wildlife and nature photographer, the image shows a leopard laying its aerodynamic body on a tree branch, balancing its front part above the bough and leaving the tail hung below it. Its mysterious, wide eyes keep looking for its prey or any possible threat. That's one. Mr Thomas has asked Twitter users to find the other, a cub whose face he says is visible in the image.Can you spot a young leopard cubs face.@NikonIndia@ParveenKaswanpic.twitter.com/NPp3nBRFWs— Mohan Thomas (@GetMohanThomas) June 25, 2021Since being posted, many people have tried and some have been successful in finding the cub, which seems to be avoiding all the attention the fully grown leopard is seeking and has camouflaged itself somewhere.“That's a baby!
