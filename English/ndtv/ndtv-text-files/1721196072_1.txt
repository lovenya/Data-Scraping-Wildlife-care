Representational Image. (Thinkstock)Beijing: China's population of wild giant pandas jumped nearly 17 per cent over a decade, state media reported, citing an official survey, with conservation measures credited as being behind the increase.

The investigation by the State Forestry Administration (SFA) found that by the end of 2013 China had 1,864 giant pandas alive in the wild, marking an increase of 268 individuals, or 16.8 per cent, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.

The figures compared with a previous survey carried out in 2003, Xinhua said.

The SFA said conservation efforts led to the increase, according to Xinhua. 

Besides population, panda habitat also increased 11.8 per cent to 2.58 million hectares compared with the 2003 survey, Xinhua said.China had 375 giant pandas in captivity at the end of 2013, the report said, with 166 males and 209 females.

The total figure marked a gain of 211, or 128.7 per cent, compared with 2003, Xinhua said, citing SFC figures. The report also said that as of June last year there were 42 pandas, including adults and cubs, overseas in 12 countries.

China has cultivated a global fascination with pandas into its diplomacy by sending the animals to overseas zoos where they have proven a wildly popular draw.
