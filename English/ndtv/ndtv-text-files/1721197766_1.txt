The Gurgaon wildlife department said it has rescued 45 posionous snakes. (Representational)Gurgaon: The Gurgaon wildlife department said it has rescued an "unprecedented" 450 poisonous snakes of different categories in last two months, including some from high-rise apartments.

Officials pointed that such a high number of snakes being rescued from residential areas may be linked to very hot summers this year. However, the start of monsoon has given some relief to the residents and the number has come down, they said.

"The atmospheric temperature was very high in summer season this year which is considered ideal breeding situation for reptiles. We have rescued majority of the snakes from localities adjoining the Aravalli mountain," said Anil Gadass, the Gurgaon wild life officer and an expert rescuer.

"So far, 450 snakes have been rescued in July and August in residential complexes, including high-rise apartments," said Anil Gadass, the Gurgaon wild life officer and an expert rescuer.

The reptile is generally cold-blooded by nature and therefore low temperature is uncomfortable for it. The summer months of May, June and July, he said, are ideal for its breeding with survival of eggs on the higher side.

"In last 8 to 10 years, we have registered low percentage of rains in Gurgaon. Due to this, the temperature is rising and it is very high this year. It allows snakes' eggs to survive and provides ideal atmosphere of their growth. This is the reason why large number of reptiles survived and strayed into human localities," Anil Gadass said.

In Gurgaon, a large numbers of localities - like DFL phase 1, 3, sector 56, 57, 58, and Kadarpur - are situated on the edge of Aravalli mountains.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com
