Wildlife photography never seemed more fun. For the "Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards," photographers had to send in the "funniest wildlife pictures, taken in the wild".

From a lion seemingly winking at the lens, to a squirrel attempting a high jump, to a tiger looking like it's laughing, photographers have managed to send in some incredible pictures.

"I love seeing the funny pictures... Strangely enough, they are harder to come by than you might think," contest Founder and Chair of the Judges Paul Joynson-Hicks says on the official website.
