											An Egyptian vulture with an injured wing was rescued from East Delhi's Patparganj area today. The bird, who had sustained an injury on its right wing, appeared to be in pain as it struggled to fly. It was rescued from a temple where it had taken shelter by an animal welfare NGO, Wildlife SOS.

"I found the bird in the premises and on seeing that it was injured, I immediately alerted the police and they called Wildlife SOS. The bird was frightened and unable to move" says Bharti Baba, the temple priest.

The bird is currently under treatment and observation, and upon complete recovery, will be released back into its natural habitat.

The Egyptian vulture, also called the white scavenger vulture, is a globally endangered species and the smallest of all vultures.
