There are currently six or seven crocodiles on the naval base.The US Naval Air Station (NAS) in Key West, Florida, was forced to shut down when a fairly large crocodile refused to leave the runway. Taking to Facebook, the NAS posted a photo of the seven-foot reptile on Monday. “Sunning Croc and Super Hornet,” read the caption. “This airfield resident was soaking up some sun on one of our runways recently and didn't want to budge. Wildlife Biologist Rosa Gonzales had to call in reinforcement from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation to move the stubborn American crocodile outside the fence line,” the post added. According to The Independent, the officials at the bases said that the predator was safely relocated to another area.
