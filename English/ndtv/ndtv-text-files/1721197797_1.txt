An evident reminder why not to leave your door wide open ... AND ... Also why it is important to keep your dogs on a leash when living/visiting/recreating in lion country. You never know what you may encounter. pic.twitter.com/VpJzllLPII- CPW NE Region (@CPW_NE) September 17, 2018The video collected quite a few reactions (and some jokes) on Twitter:Yikes. I only worry about mosquitos when leaving the door open. https://t.co/pkIsLqrjkn- Jillith S (@Jillith) September 18, 2018Here kitty, kitty... https://t.co/t0Mzl93QZK- Donna D (@RockyMtnDonna) September 18, 2018Obviously this mountain lion doesn't listen to the Eagles (i.e., you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave)... https://t.co/tFcgSv2K9y- keithboulder (@kamoore63) September 18, 2018According to Colorado Parks and Wildlife, much of Colorado, including the Front Range, is prime mountain lion country. The state is home to around 7,000 mountain lions, which means man-animal conflict is not uncommon. In March this year, for example, a wildlife official was forced to climb a tree in a residential neighbourhood to capture a mountain lion that was napping on it.Also ReadDog Turns On Stove In US House, Apple HomePad Alerts Owners Of FireSmall Airplane Crashes In Front Yard Of US Home, 4 InjuredTeen Sets Fire To Wrong Home For Revenge Over Stolen iPhone, Now Faces 60 Years In Jail PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com  Click for more trending news
