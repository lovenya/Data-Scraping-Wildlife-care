											A six-feet-long Indian Rock Python was rescued by the Wildlife SOS Rapid Response Unit from Agra Water Works along the Yamuna in Agra today.

Shivamurti Garad, the safety manager of the plant, contacted the wildlife conservation NGO after workers spotted the python in the sludge.

A two-member rescue team swiftly captured the reptile to release it back in its natural habitat.

Shivamurti Garad said, "We didn't want to cause any harm to the reptile so we let it remain near the exposed sludge bed till the Wildlife SOS team reached the site."
