											A tiger cub, which was missing from Ranthambore National Park (RNP) since last two months, has been traced in the Keladevi Wildlife Sanctuary.

A camera trap deployed at Keladevi Wildlife Sanctuary, on November 20 and 24, captured the first-ever images of Tiger T-71, cub of tigress T-30, since it went missing from Khandar Range in RNP around September this year, members of a joint survey team of WWF India and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve said.

Project coordinator of Western India Tiger Landscape-WWF India and one of the members of survey team, Sunny Shah, said the tiger T-71 was first seen out of Ranthambhore National Park in September 2014.

Tiger pugmarks were found in Karanpur range of Keladevi WLS around mid September, Shah said, adding that in their initial surveys in October, they established that a tiger was present in the gorges of the same range.
