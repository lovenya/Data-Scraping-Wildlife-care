Wildlife officers were called to a business in Dania Beach, Florida, on Thursday, reports CNN.

He recorded a video of Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission officers removing the huge snake from the car. The scary footage was later shared by FWC on social media.

According to the US Geological Survey, non-native Burmese pythons are one of the most concerning invasive species in Everglades National Park. They compete with native species for food, and have been linked to severe mammal declines in the area. The FWC in its post thanked people for reporting the python, writing: "This is a success for native wildlife since pythons prey on native birds, mammals and reptiles. Thanks to the citizen who reported the python to us. We rely on reports from the public to help us quickly respond and remove these species."Click for more trending news
