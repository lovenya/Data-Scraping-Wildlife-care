"The staff was packing up after the evening show when they spotted the snake in the control room," Mr. Akram, Booking Counter Manager at the fort was quoted as saying.

The Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department staff found the rat snake amidst a pile of unused wires inside the control room.

After ensuring that the area was cordoned off, a three-member team carefully transferred the snake into a safe transport container. Although non-venomous, the rat snake are known to be quick and easily excitable, and may bite if threatened.
