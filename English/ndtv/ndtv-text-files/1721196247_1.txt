											A captivating new video shows beachgoers in Massachusetts save a seven-foot great white shark that got stranded on the shore, by pouring water on the creature one bucket at a time - till it is finally rescued.

Witnesses said the shark, a juvenile male, was attempting to catch seagulls on the sandbar and became stranded when the tide went out.
 
 
 
The video, posted to YouTube, shows the shark gasping for breath on the beach, its tail flipping in desperation, as onlookers watch with concern.

Two men, later identified as harbormaster Stuart Smith and shark expert Gregory Skomal, then start scooping buckets of water and splashing the shark.

Motionless at first, the shark then seems to jolt back to life much to cries of joy and encouragement from the gathered crowd.
