The team carefully removed the cobra from the farmhouse and released it back into its natural environment. The Wildlife SOS, in collaboration with the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, found the cobra eating the Viper by slowly swallowing the head first. Both the snakes were involved in a brutal fight. Viral Video | Railways Employee's Feat Helps Train Resume JourneyIn the clip, the cobra can be seen utilizing a very special feature that snakes possess that allows them to swallow prey much bigger than their heads, like a big rodent or, in this case, another enormous snake. Indian cobras can be found across India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and southern Nepal. They can grow up to six and a half feet long, and they generally prey upon mammals as an adult, and amphibians, small snakes and lizards when juvenile. The colour of their skin varies according to the habitat, ranging from black with white streaks to a uniform brownish-grey.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comViral Video | Delhi Metro Posts "Parting Ways From Weekend" Tweet As Busy Week BeginsIn another strange instance earlier this month, a cobra was found at a railway station in Rajasthan.
