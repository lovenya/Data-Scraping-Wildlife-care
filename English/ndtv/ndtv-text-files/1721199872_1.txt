Good wildlife photographers use telescopic lenses to get good wildlife shots from a distance. This was clearly too close, and the drone operator hopefully learned something from loss of their drone. Don't be like this guy!‚Äî SwansonFineArts (@SwansonFineArts) December 21, 2022Wild life captured the drone ü§£

Lesson from this video : give some privacy to animals.‚Äî Fahad (@DawaFahad) December 20, 2022Good. I hope the drone was expensive but it probably wasn't. Using drones to harass wildlife is inappropriate. Illegal in some places and should be in most.‚Äî Mason Flint (@masonfl) December 20, 2022PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comLol the gator is like "shit they're onto us!
