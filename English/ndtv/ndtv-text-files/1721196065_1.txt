											Glimpses of wildlife, iconic buildings of Maharashtra and actors and musicians from Bollywood: these are some of the subjects in photographs taken by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, displayed at an exhibition that opened in Mumbai today.

The event was attended by tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Husain, singer Shankar Mahadevan and popular Marathi actor Sachin Pilgaonkar.

So how does the politician manage to find the time to indulge his hobby amid his busy political schedule?

"Photography is like oxygen for me. My hobby is my oxygen. It would be wrong to say I don't have time," Mr Thackeray told NDTV.

"His pictures reflected his love for art, India and Maharashtra. He has managed to strike a balance between politics and passion," said Zakir Husain.
