Satellite telemetry will help us to know the cause of death and prevent other vultures dying from that cause."The satellite tags will also be useful in discovering whether the captive-bred birds behave normally in the wild with other closely-related species.In the first event of its kind in South Asia, the government of Nepal and national and international conservation organisations released critically endangered white-backed vultures in the wild in 2017.India is home to nine species of vultures.

Before that, findings from the first proposed release batch will be crucial in the future programmes."The long-billed and slender-billed vultures will be released in Madhya Pradesh and Assam, respectively.Officials admit the flight to freedom of these endangered vultures is still caught in red-tapism in the Haryana Forest Department, which has been authorised to procure 10 platform terminal transmitters or satellite telemetries through global bidding.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com"These birds have been shifted to the pre-release aviary for over a year and a half. Twice their release was postponed last year. The only hurdle is the procurement of satellite telemetries and that too is bogged down by bureaucratic delays," an official, requesting anonymity, told IANS."The birds are now two to four years old and this is the best age group for their release. The delay in their release will definitely delay the vulture reintroduction programme," he added.
