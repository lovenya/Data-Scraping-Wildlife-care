											A nearly nine-foot-long crocodile, that entered a village in Uttar Pradesh's Agra district and struck panic, has been rescued and released into the river, officials said on Monday.

The massive reptile was safely rescued by Wildlife SOS, an NGO, and released in the Chambal river, in the presence of forest department officials.

The crocodile was spotted in Paroli village in Fatehabad tehsil of Agra district. The villagers managed to keep the crocodile from venturing deeper into the village.

A team of two rescuers from Wildlife SOS, accompanied by forest officials, carried out the rescue operation. The reptile's right foot was found missing, which seemed to be a result of an older injury.

Baiju Raj M.V., Director Conservation Projects, Wildlife SOS said: "This is the second crocodile we have rescued from Fatehabad this year."
