P-22, a mountain lion, has become one of Los Angeles' most famous felines.After attacking and killing a pet dog last month, famed Griffith Park mountain lion P-22 was captured on Monday, December 12, in the backyard of a Los Feliz home in Los Angeles, according to a news release from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the National Park Service.Officials successfully tranquillized the mountain lion known as P-22 and transported him to a wild animal care facility for a full health evaluation. The big cat was tracked down by forest officials using GPS technology attached to the mountain lion's tracking collar.Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and the National Park Service (NPS) have thanked the community for their assistance and for refraining from intervening in the effort.This was an unprecedented situation in which a mountain lion had survived in such a densely populated area. As per the news release, CDFW and NPS have long partnered on issues related to P-22 and will work together to find the most humane option available for the lion and the community in which he lives.
