											There seems to be no limit to what people will do to get the best selfie or perfect photograph these days. But it isn't a good idea always - case in point, this video shared by wildlife conservationist Bittu Sahgal on Facebook.

The nail-biting video, shared on December 4, shows exactly what you shouldn't do when you come face to face with a tiger in its natural habitat. The video shows a bunch of wildlife enthusiasts, some riding on an elephant and others in an open jeep, staring at a tiger casually sitting by the bushes. You can then see the jeep backing towards the tiger so someone can take pictures of it. All this while, you can hear the sound of the camera clicking pictures in the background.

In just a matter of seconds, the tiger goes from lounging about to lunging furiously towards the elephant and the jeep. What's worse is that the rate at which the camera clicks only increases at this point. Luckily, the tiger backs away and runs into the bushes, without harming anyone. But it's not hard to imagine what could have happened if the tiger hadn't retreated.
