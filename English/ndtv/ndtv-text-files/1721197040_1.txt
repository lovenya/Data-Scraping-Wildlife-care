Woodside Wildlife Park said: "It is with great sadness that we must announce the passing away of Tango the tiger."

Tango and his partner were saved hours before they were due to be put down.

On his 20th birthday, Tango was given a cardboard birthday cake filled with meat to celebrate his milestone.
