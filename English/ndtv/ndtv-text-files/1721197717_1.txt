Does your idea of a thrilling holiday mean heading to a wildlife destination and being in the midst of nature? As scary as it may sound for some, for wildlife lovers there's no greater feeling than being in the wild and sighting animals in their natural habitat. Luckily, there are many incredible wildlife sanctuaries and national parks across India that house myriad wild animals - lion, royal Bengal tiger, snow leopards, one horned rhinoceros, blackbuck, red panda, bison - to make a trip an immensely memorable one.
If you have been dying to get away from the concrete jungle and head to the wild, here are six wildlife destinations that you should include in your travel list, which are easy to access:1. Jim Corbett National ParkTouted to be the oldest national park in India, Jim Corbett is one of the most popular wildlife destinations for sighting the Bengal tiger. Since it's also a tiger reserve, only selected areas are open for tourists. It's also its lush surroundings that make the safari experience an enjoyable one. If you are lucky, you can also sight leopards, sambar, Himalayan black bear, hog deer and others.

Gir Forest National ParkIf you want to sight the king of the jungle, this is the place to head to.

Bandhavgarh National ParkSituated in the central part of India, Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh is again a popular pick for those keen on sighting tigers. If luck's in your favour, you can perhaps spot a white tiger and live to tell the tale. Although Bandhavgarh is said to have a high population of tigers in India, it is still a protected area. Tala is the most popular zone to sight the majestic beasts.Nearest airport: Jabalpur . . . . . #animallovers #animalpolis #animalsofinstagram #igscwildlife #animales #exclusive_animals #wildlifephoto #wildlifeaddicts #wildlifephotography #getoutside #safari #tigersafari #theglobewanderer #letsgosomewhere #nationalpark #optoutside #photographerlife #wildlifephotographer #bandhavgarhnationalpark #bandhavgarhsafari #incredibleindia #photographers_of_india #wildlifephotographer #storiesofindia #tigerreserve #nikonphotography #nikontop #bandhavgarh #nikon_photography #focalmarkedA post shared by  saurabh (@sky_sailor_photography) on Jul 19, 2018 at 3:58am PDT 6. Nagarhole National ParkA popular getaway from Bengaluru and Mysuru, some say that it's almost certain that you will spot a tiger at the Nagarhole National Park. Although Bandipur is another popular wildlife destination in the vicinity, many prefer Nagarhole for its lush greenery with pretty waterfalls and streams, and the Kabini river. You can also spot elephants, bisons and other animals.Nearest airport: Mysuru When he arrives, it is time to confront one’s phobias…. Of the native species of big cats prowling the forests of Karnataka, it is the elusive and magnificent melanistic leopard that everyone touring Nagarhole Tiger Reserve wants to see. It is only a few who have actually seen this beautiful feline predator in its full glory in the wild. My love for the Leopards is immense. This spectacular cat reflects to me the potential of my own power, the beauty of the mystery, the ability to transform anything we choose to in our lives, and the richness of the forests I roam in. it reflects a reclaiming of that which was lost and an intimate connection with the great archetypal force behind it. Such a dramatic species.#canon #catfamily #animalkingdom #exclusive_wildlife #forest #nagarhole #blackpanther #wild #wildlifeonearth #animalkingdom #leopard #forest #junglefever #natgeo #natgeotravel #natgeoyourshot #magnificentanimals #wildlifephotography #focus #conservation #wildlife #travel #travelblogger #beautifulcreaturesA post shared by  Vinay Mb (@vinay.mb.9) on Jul 18, 2018 at 1:12am PDT  CommentsSo go on, plan a thrilling trip and enjoy the best of wildlife.Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comwildlife destinations in indiaWildlifetiger reserves in indiaADVERTISEMENTShow full article
