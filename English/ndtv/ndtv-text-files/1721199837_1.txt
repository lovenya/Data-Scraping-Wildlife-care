The bright green and gold colours drew me straight to it. I flipped it over and saw it had lots of tiny legs - I had never seen anything like it. It being an alien definitely crossed my mind - or I thought it might be something from way out in the deep sea," Mr Arnott told Edinburgh Live.However, Pete Haskell from the Scottish Wildlife Trust dismissed his speculations and identified the animal as a sea mouse, a type of worm. "It looks a bit strange being out of the water, but it's a type of marine bristle worm that's found all around the UK coast," Mr Haskell said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe worm looked unusual and different from other marine animals because of its shimmering green and gold bristles. The bristles can also flash green, blue or red, to warn off predators.
