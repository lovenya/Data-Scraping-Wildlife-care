Talk about holidaying in India, and one can't leave out Rajasthan from the conversation. Touted as the most tourist friendly Indian state, Rajasthan is an absolute beauty. For long it has been attracting travellers from all across the globe for its marvellous palaces, grand forts and impeccable hospitality. Every place is different from the other, with its own special offerings. You can actually step back in time and get a glimpse of the lavish life led by the Rajput kings; truly living up to its claim for being the 'land of rajas'. But other than it's inclination towards architecture, culture and arts, it is also Rajasthan's wildlife experiences that make it a perfect pick for a thrilling holiday.
So if you have been meaning to take some time off and explore Rajasthan, then you need to make a note of these holiday destinations that are must-visits. Here goes:1. UdaipurMore commonly known as the city of lakes and the kingdom of Mewar, five of the major lakes include Fateh Sagar Lake, Lake Pichola, Swaroop Sagar Lake, Rangsagar and Doodh Talai Lake.

JodhpurThe walled city of Jodhpur is iconic for its shade of blue, thus known as the blue city. The Mehrangarh Fort and the Umaid Bhawan Palace are the two most iconic places to visit, which are sure to mesmerise you. The Ranisar and Padamsar lakes are two adjoining lakes in the city of Jodhpur built over 500 years ago. They are situated at the rear of the Mehrangarh Fort, near the Fateh Pol. These scenic lakes were created to conserve water, as Jodhpur falls under a desert region where water is scarce. The tranquillity of these adjacent lakes is complemented brilliantly by the stark contrast of the majestic Mehrangarh Fort, making it a sight to behold. The clear waters have been preserved and maintained for centuries, providing a serene vibe and an almost identical reflection of the grand fort on its surface. The development of the two lakes was commissioned by two different queens in the 15th century. Ranisar lake was made on the orders of Queen Jasmade Hadi, wife of Rao Jodha, the founder of Jodhpur. Padamsar lake was created by Queen Padmini, the daughter of Rana Sanga of Mewar. These lakes were built to conserve water in the desert region, serving as excellent examples of the age-old tradition of royal women being in charge of overseeing the public water systems. They represent the classic water storage systems that are ever present throughout this region. They are considered a consistent source of water in the city. #mehrangarh #instajodhpur #insta_jodhpur #bluecity #jodhpur #suncity #jodhpur #royal #experience #heritage #tourism #tourist #Jodhpurite #indian #culture #photoshoot #ranisar #padamsar #summer #time #indian #people #memorableview #beautiful #girl #posing #amazing #view #perfect #location #for #shootADVERTISEMENTA post shared by  JODHPUR (@insta_jodhpur) on Jul 11, 2018 at 4:52am PDT3.
