Amongst the cautious voices, an excited user wrote, "Can't wait to come and visit!" 
Their enthusiasm reflected the allure of witnessing such a unique spectacle firsthand, despite the underlying dangers that accompany it.
Another user chimed in with a thoughtful opinion, "Yes, that's definitely an accident waiting to happen. It's their natural instinct to protect their food. What pleasure would someone get out of this?"
In a lighthearted manner, one comment stated, "Whatever happens...I am on the lion's side!" 
A witty remark cleverly noted, "When the main dish is eating dessert with you."
