Laws were also by-passed and a fresh ordinance was also passed in order to facilitate the project," Goa Congress legal cell and former advocate general Carlos Ferreira alleged."Since then there have been three governments headed by the BJP, from 2012-2014 by Parrikar himself, from 2014-2017 headed by Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar and the current government headed by Parrikar.
