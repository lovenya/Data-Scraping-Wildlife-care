											In this man vs wild video, a group of men save an almost-helpless goat from becoming a hungry python's lunch.

The dramatic rescue, shared on YouTube on July 18, was filmed in or around the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich district. It shows a python wrapped around a poor goat, struggling to free itself from the jaws of death. Meanwhile, a group of local men can be seen watching the snake and goat's tussle, trying to think of something to do.

Eventually, one of the men steps in to help the goat. The video shows the man whacking the snake on its head until it releases its prey. The animal had struggled for over 40 minutes before it was freed.

As soon as the goat is released, it can be seen running away while the python, done out of its meal, can be seen slithering into the nearby bushes.
