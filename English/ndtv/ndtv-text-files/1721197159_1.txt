Investigation on

The dolphin, which had several bruises on its head, was kept at the police station for hours after bringing it from Nariman Point at 3.30 am, as the officers were not able to contact the forest department. "We have been trying to connect with them since finding the mammal," said Babar.

"After the forest department arrives, inspects, takes the mammal for autopsy, and finds the cause of death, a report will be prepared by the team and given to the senior officials," said forest officer Gite YP from their Thane office.

We are reclaiming skies, land and water, polluting it and exploiting other species. There are hundreds of cases that don't even make it for autopsy; they go unreported. We will definitely pay the price one day. These are rare and intelligent species. We are upsetting the ecosystem; this has come at a time when people need to be reminded what will happen if we disturb nature."
