                2 months It's one of our favorite times of the year: The Conservation Tech Award is back!

For the 4th year running, the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) is providing two $15,000 grants to help protect wildlife through cutting-edge, technology-driven efforts. Are you deploying or developing tech to protect wildlife? We want to see your application! We are specifically looking to support existing efforts that have already demonstrated a measure of success and not for proposals of intended future work. Here's a look at the two grants:
‍ ‍Technology Adopter Grant: This grant is for an organization that adopted technology in new or novel ways for conservation management. Technology Practitioner Grant: This grant is for an organization that has developed technology (e.g., software, applications, AI models/algorithms, hardware) to advance conservation management. Both EarthRanger users and non-users are welcome to apply for either grant; there is no requirement to become an EarthRanger user to apply and no preference is given to EarthRanger users in the evaluation of applications.
