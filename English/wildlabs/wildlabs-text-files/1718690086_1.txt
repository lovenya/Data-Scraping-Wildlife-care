Mobilising East African nature restoration professionals Scholarships available for training courses focussing on nature restoration in East Africa WildTeam and Natural State are currently working in partnership to create a series of residential training courses focussing on nature restoration in East Africa. Successful candidates will be offered full scholarships to attend training in topics including designing and managing nature restoration projects, organisational development, impact monitoring and financial mechanisms.

We have created a short survey to assess demand for these courses, and to help identify potential candidates. The survey is for anyone based in East Africa (Burundi, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda). We want to hear from aspiring conservationists, practitioners and those currently working in other sectors and looking to change careers.

This is a really exciting opportunity and we want to reach as many people as possible, so please share the details of the survey with anyone you think might be interested. 

Here is a link to the survey. If you have any questions at all, please email Matthew@wildteam.org.uk.
