Creating Awareness on Bushmeat Offences Using Local Barazas and SMS My project seeks to create awareness on bushmeat activities, through physical barazas as well use of technology (SMS – in Swahili) to disseminate messages on the offences and penalties under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2013. Bushmeat issues continue to impede law enforcement efforts not just in Tsavo but across many African Landscapes. My project seeks to create awareness on bushmeat activities, through physical barazas as well use of technology (SMS – in Swahili) to disseminate messages on the offences and penalties under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2013. In March, I conducted sensitization barazas in two villages – Aliya and Kamtonga villages. The two villages are rife with bushmeat issues. This first phase of the project focused creating awareness on bushmeat offences. For instance, dealing in meat of wildlife species attracts a minimum imprisonment of 3 years. This was also an opportunity to request the community to share their mobile phone contacts through which SMS’s on these offences shall be shared. The second phase will majorly be focusing on creating on wildlife crimes awareness in the aforementioned villages through the use of SMS. Stay tuned!
