CERES TAG Ceres Tag sends just in time alerts and GPS location to have the power to track and trace. Ceres Tags devices (Ceres Wild, Ceres Ranch & Ceres Trace) allows for teams to monitor tagged animals to receive a range of alerts.  Alerts that can help you locate the animal, boundary alerts, high and low activity. Tracking animals has never been easier. Whether you're 200m or 2000km away, finding your animal's location is only a click away. As the tag is solar powered, it doesn’t need to be removed to change batteries. Which means no additional battery purchases and battery waste. Ceres Tag products are perfect for remote areas, animals that travel vast distances, to the local zoos and conservation parks. The data from the tag is sent straight to satellite, which means there is no need for towers, gateways and infrastructure. Never lose your animals again, with GPS tracking and receive software alerts to notify you of abnormal activity. https://www.cerestag.com/ https://www.linkedin.com/company/ceres-tag/ https://www.facebook.com/ceres.tag
