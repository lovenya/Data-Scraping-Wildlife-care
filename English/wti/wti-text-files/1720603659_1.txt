Chennai: The Madras High Court, in an interim judgment Thursday, passed the ruling in favour of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department in a case against private establishments which obstructed movement of wild elephants in Segur Plateau and around Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. The next date for hearing has been scheduled for November 19.
Announcing the judgment, Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, forbid new constructions in these areas. The court also called for immediate cessation of ongoing constructions, and removal of physical barriers such as wires and power fences.
Dr B Ramakrishnan, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) field officer, who is among the team of researchers assisting the forest department, said, “We are optimistic that the final ruling will be in favour of the elephants who have been using these routes for migration for generations.”
“The court’s ruling will have long-term benefits for elephant conservation in this area. It will facilitate securing of at least four corridors – Masinagudi-Moyar (Moyar-Avarahalla), Masinagudi-Singara (Kalmalai Singara and Avarahalla), Mavinahalla-Chemmanatham (Avarahalla-Singara), and Glencorin-Vazhaithottam (Kalhatti-Singara and Glencorin),” added Dr Ramakrishnan.
All of these corridors have been extensively ground-truthed by WTI as a preliminary requisite to securement.
The four corridors are among the 88 critical elephant corridors listed in the WTI publication ‘Right of Passage: Elephant corridors of India’. WTI, with the support of World Land Trust, Elephant Family, IUCN-Netherlands, has been working to secure critical elephant corridors across the country, by purchasing corridor land from  private owners and transferring it to the government for inclusion into adjoining protected areas, or through community involvement.
