Kaziranga(Assam): On September 23, 2007, a poacher, Gaonbura Ronfar was reportedly killed inside the Kaziranga National Park by an adult female rhino. Gaonbura Ronfar alias Kambura alias Babu was a resident of Natundanga village of Koliabor sub-division of Assam. He had entered the Kukurakata RF, Burapahar Range at night, along with a person from the Paite community of Nagaland, to hunt the endangered animal.




The story spun around when the irate animal, which had its calf along with it, reportedly attacked the duo in self defence. Gaonbura is believed to have died on the spot while his accomplice managed to escape.
The message of Gaonbura’s death was passed on to his family via a local youth by his accomplice. Gaonbura’s death was kept a secret by his family members. However, the Range Officer, Ekramul Muzid came to know of the incident through an informer, and started an investigation.
In the beginning, the family members insisted that the death was due to natural causes, but on further questioning, they confessed about the real cause of death. On October 2, the matter was informed to the local Police.
Gaonbura was known to be a notorious poacher and had been connected to killings of several rhinos in Kaziranga. He was arrested in 2003 but was later released due to the lack of conclusive evidence.
