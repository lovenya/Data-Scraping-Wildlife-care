It is with profound sadness that the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) announces the passing of Dr. Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, a luminary in the field of conservation, who breathed his last, at 98 years old. Dr. Swaminathan’s life and career were distinguished by unwavering dedication to environmental preservation and agricultural advancement. As we come to terms with his loss, we pay our heartfelt tribute to a man whose indomitable spirit and relentless pursuit of excellence have left an indelible mark on the world.
Dr. Swaminathan’s affiliation with the IUCN was emblematic of his commitment to conservation. His tenure as the President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) illuminated the path forward for the preservation of our planet’s biodiversity.
“For those fortunate enough to have worked alongside Dr. Swaminathan, his leadership was nothing short of transformative. His tenure as the President of WWF India, which coincided with the commencement of my career 35 years ago, was a masterclass in compassion and dedication”, writes Vivek Menon, Founder and ED of Wildlife Trust of India. “Dr. Swaminathan possessed an extraordinary ability to remember not only the professional aspects of individuals but also their personal challenges, even long after their professional interactions had ceased. This exemplary trait not only exemplified his commitment to people but also underscored the value of nurturing lasting personal friendships, a virtue he held dear”, adds Mr. Menon.

Dr. Swaminathan, hailed as the ‘Father on Indian Green Revolution’ was a true visionary, renowned for his inspiring oratory skills. Whether he stood before a gathering of thousands or a small group of enthusiasts, he had the remarkable ability to captivate his audience without the need for visual aids. His words, always carefully chosen, resonated deeply, leaving an indelible impression on all who had the privilege of hearing him speak.
Today, as we bid farewell to a true visionary, we remember Dr. M.S. Swaminathan not only for his remarkable professional achievements but also for his innate kindness, humility, and unwavering commitment to safeguarding our planet’s natural heritage. His legacy will continue to inspire generations of conservationists and agricultural scientists to come.
In the wake of this immense loss, the Wildlife Trust of India extends its deepest condolences to Dr. Swaminathan’s family and friends. We pledge to honor his memory by redoubling our efforts to protect and preserve the rich tapestry of life on this planet, a cause that was near and dear to his heart.
As we mourn the passing of Dr. Swaminathan, let us also celebrate his life and the profound impact he had on the world of conservation and agriculture. His legacy will forever serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for all those dedicated to the preservation of our planet’s natural wonders.
