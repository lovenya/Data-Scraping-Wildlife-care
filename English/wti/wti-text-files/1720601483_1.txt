Qinhai Forest Police arrested Mahakemu, a top criminal involved in one of the largest Tibetan Antelope poaching cases, after 15 days of chasing. With his arrest, all the five criminals involved in the poaching case of December 13, 2001 have been caught and the Qinhai Police announced that the case has been cracked.
Mahakemu along with four other people drove into Kekexili to hunt Tibetan antelope in November 2001. On December 13, this gang was arrested by the patrol of Kekexili National Nature Reserve Management Bureau. As many as 518 antelope pelts, 2 jeeps, 1 small caliber rifle and 4000 bullets were found on site. Mahakemu managed to escape when he was being escorted to the police station. The Kekexili National Nature Reserve Management Bureau immediately deployed police to chase him and finally arrested him in the afternoon of December 25, in the city of Ge Er Mu in Qinghai province.
It is said that Mahakemu is a professional poacher. He had been arrested by Wild Yak Patrol in 1998 after poaching 300 Tibetan antelopes in Kekexili but managed to flee. By the end of 2000, he poached nearly 600 Tibetan antelopes along the boundary of Xinjiang and Tibet with other poachers.
