Alwar: The Court of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate – II, Alwar, on Saturday, convicted poacher Kalia Bawaria for hunting a tiger in Sariska Tiger Reserve on May 7, 2003. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a fine of Rs 35,000.



Kalia was apprehended in 2005 from his hideout by a team of Rajasthan Forest Department led by Parta Ram, Range Officer, Sariska. A gun and three traps were recovered from his possession.
This is the fourth conviction for Kalia, according to Koushal Sharma, Advocate, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) who assisted the prosecution.
“Every such conviction is a reminder of how individual by individual, the entire population of tigers were wiped out of Sariska,” says Ashok Kumar, Vice Chairman and Trustee, Wildlife Trust of India. “However, this also proves the worth of Indian legal system and sends out a strong message to offenders, that the law will catch up to them, and make them pay the price for stealing from the country.”
