Assam, August 12: Every year, on August 12th, the world comes together to commemorate World Elephant Day. This important day serves as a platform to increase awareness about the global situation and conservation efforts related to these magnificent creatures. The focus is on the protection and well-being of these gentle giants across the globe.
In the spirit of honouring India’s natural heritage animal, World Elephant Day was joyously celebrated by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) alongside the students of Middle Elementary Govt. School in Dikrong Village, located in Sadiya, Assam. Dikrong village holds a significant place as one of the fringe settlements along the D’Ering-Dibru Elephant Corridor. This corridor is a critical passage for elephants, making human-elephant interactions quite frequent in this region.
Our dedicated team members in Sadiya orchestrated a special event, aimed to provide a platform for the young stakeholders who coexist with elephants in their shared environment to express their perspectives through the medium of art and craft. This initiative not only empowered the youth but also gave them an opportunity to share their experiences of living alongside elephants.
The event wasn’t merely a celebration but a fun-oriented effort to bridge the gap between humans and elephants by fostering understanding and empathy. Through their creative expressions, the students conveyed their unique viewpoints and stories, shedding light on the challenges as well as the harmonies that arise from their coexistence with elephants. The Dikrong Village event is a testament to the power of collaboration and education in promoting a more peaceful relationship between humans and elephants.
The Elephant Day celebration began with a sketching session to explore the perspectives of around 70 students on elephants, Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC), and conservation issues. The drawings provided intriguing insights into their thoughts, offering diverse viewpoints on various aspects of human-elephant interactions and the elephants’ habitat. These artistic creations not only showcased the students’ reflections effectively but also fostered ecological awareness. The artwork facilitated knowledge sharing and enhanced understanding of both their environment and the significance of elephant conservation.

The celebration continued with a mask-making session and an interactive dialogue with the young participants. As they carefully crafted elephant masks from paper, these little hands shared their personal encounters with elephants. Their anecdotes ranged from witnessing elephants pass by their village roads on their way to the Reserve forest while waiting in local vehicles, to observing elephants drinking from the river within the Reserve forest, and even encountering elephants in their fields consuming their crops.

These candid stories, paired with their creatively imaginative elephant-themed artwork, offer a powerful tool for imparting essential conservation education. Through these engaging activities, the young stakeholders not only gain insights into elephant behavior but also develop a positive outlook toward elephants. These interactions contribute to fostering sustainable actions for elephant conservation, solidifying the importance of coexistence and empathy for the gentle giants.
