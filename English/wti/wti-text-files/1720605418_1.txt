Kaziranga, 11 June 2020:
In yet another successful rescue and release story, a severely dehydrated and stressed female jungle cat kitten which had been rescued from a household at Kathalgui village, Karbi Anglong district, in February this year was successfully released by WTI’s team from Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), Kaziranga.
“The kitten was nearly a month old and dehydrated, with visible markers of being stressed. We provided her with necessary care and treatment for the first three months to revive its health”, mentioned Dr Panjit Basumatary, wildlife veterinarian. The jungle cat kitten received this care for four months under the watchful eye of trained WTI vets and animal keepers and had gained 3.3kg in body weight during this period.

WTI’s team ensured a soft release of the kitten, gradually exposing it to its natural environment but also giving it an option of coming back to the rescue shelter after release.
The team also marked its ears for identification in the field during its post release monitoring done by placing camera traps and through field surveillance by our biologists to track its movements.
Wildlife Trust of India has been working in North East India since 2000 and continues to work to ensure displaced and distressed wildlife has a fair chance of going back to the wild.
