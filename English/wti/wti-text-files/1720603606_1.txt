Kaziranga National Park (Assam): A captive elephant that suffered severe injuries in a tiger attack last week, is being treated at the IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), near Kaziranga National Park, Assam. The wounds are gradually healing but complete recovery is expected to take a long time, say veterinarians at CWRC. 
The elephant, a sub-adult female, belonging to the Assam Forest Department, was at the Mikirjan anti-poaching camp on the night of attack on August 13. Circumstantial evidence point towards presence of more than one tiger during the attack, possibly two sub-adults.
The elephant ‘Barakha’ sustained four deep puncture wounds in the right ear and one on the right side of the neck. She also suffered a deep gash in the left hind leg around the plantar surface of the foot.
After preliminary treatment at the camp, Barakha along with another sub-adult elephant, Kazi, were transferred to CWRC.
“Elephants are very sensitive animals. Barakha and Kazi share strong social bond. Although Kazi was also at the camp during the attack, he was unharmed. Since the calves were traumatised, we thought it best that they remain together. So, Kazi and Barakha are keeping each other company at CWRC,” said Dr Phulmoni Gogoi, CWRC veterinarian.
The calves are being looked after by the veterinarians and animal keepers of CWRC.
“Our main concern right now has been to prevent infections, as wounds caused by tiger are highly prone to infection. We are dressing her wounds periodically. Wounds in her ear are healing, but it’s the wound on her foot that is worrying. The pressure of the body weight is hampering recovery of the wound on the foot. It may be a long time before she is completely healed,” Dr Gogoi said.
