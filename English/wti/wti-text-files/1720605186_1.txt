Mr Rayasth introduced the audience about the meaning of biodiversity and its implications on their day to day lives. Dr Mishra’s presentation further explained how biotic diversity has been conserved and protected by villagers over several generations but is currently in the risk of becoming obsolete due to lack of awareness and traditional knowledge sharing. Dr Humpaiya from Strong Foundation explained that India still stands as a country with the most diverse natural heritage and why we should be acting now to take measures into protecting it. Along with the financial benefits of conserving our biodiversity, the day was themed around how it has been the basis of our sustenance.
WTI has recently helped form Biodiversity Management Committees in 5 village Panchayats in USTR and also published Chhattisgarh’s first People’s Biodiversity Register from Tourenga BMC. This day was about how the BMC’s gives back the right of local biodiversity to the villagers and how they are responsible for protecting it and sustaining it for the future generations. The event ended with a film screening that dramatized the whole concept of BMC and the role of villagers in the same. The film is produced by Madhya Pradesh Biodiversity Board.
