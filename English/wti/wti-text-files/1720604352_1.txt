The rescued elephant calf under care at CWRC’s Large Animal Nursery
Kaziranga National Park, Assam, January 5, 2017: A female elephant calf, just about two weeks old, was rescued by frontline forest staff from a tea estate in the Salna Forest Range (North) and brought to CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park) for treatment and long-term care yesterday afternoon.
The calf had first been rescued by forest department personnel from a drain in the Nanoi Tea Garden on Tuesday, January 3. As the natal herd was present in the vicinity, a reunion was attempted. However, the same calf was found abandoned in the nearby Amlakhi Tea Garden yesterday morning. Forest authorities kept the calf in their custody for further observation, but could not locate the herd till late morning.
Given the calf’s poor physical condition, the forest department contacted CWRC and brought it to the centre. “The calf is very weak and has visible injuries on its navel area and tail. It is in a state of severe trauma”, said Dr Panjit Basumatary, the attending veterinarian at CWRC.

An animal keeper feeds the rescued elephant calf milk formula
The calf is currently being monitored at the centre’s Large Animal Nursery. The requisite treatment is being provided to stabilise it and a treatment plan has been devised.
UPDATE: January 6, 2017: Dr Panjit Basumatary reports that the calf has made slow but visible improvement since the day it was admitted to CWRC. It is responding to milk formula and has been introduced to the outdoor paddock attached to the Large Animal Nursery during the day, so that it can bask in the sunlight. A dedicated animal keeper continues to monitor its condition closely.
