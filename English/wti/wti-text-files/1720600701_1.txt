“The MoU shows the commitment of the Gujarat Forest Department in protecting the Whale Shark and the coral reefs all along the coast of the State. We are proud to be associated with the State Government in weaving success stories of conservation, like the now well-known ‘Whale Shark and coral reef restoration’, and will always be ready to provide technical assistance in joint conservation ventures,” said Jagdish Kishwan.
WTI launched the Whale Shark Conservation Project in 2004 and the Coral Recovery Programme in 2008 and since then these two projects have achieved phenomenal success in marine conservation in Gujarat. In collaboration with multiple partners, WTI has launched several awareness campaigns that have brought sea change in people’s, especially the fishing community’s, perception towards marine biodiversity.
