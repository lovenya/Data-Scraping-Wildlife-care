1st June 2024: Late Shri Rajendra Singh Kushre was a forester posted in the Shahpur range of the Dindori division, Madhya Pradesh. He displayed unwavering dedication to his work and possessed extensive knowledge about the forest. 
On May 1st 2024 Kushre was informed of a forest fire in Beat No. 117 of the Budhan range. Despite his underlying health problems, he immediately set out to join the firefighting efforts. He spent the entire night tirelessly battling to douse the fire, which unfortunately exacerbated his medical condition. Despite his weakening state, he urged his team to persevere, insisting that they could all depart once the fire was contained.
The following day, his condition took a turn for the worse, and he exhibited symptoms of paralysis, necessitating his admission to the Dindori district hospital for urgent medical care. According to the medical report, his blood pressure had risen considerably due to prolonged exposure to smoke, with doctors suspecting a blood clot in his brain. Tragically, on May 5th, while en route to a hospital in Nagpur for further treatment, Kushre succumbed to his condition.
