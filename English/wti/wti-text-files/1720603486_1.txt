Kaziranga, Assam: An adult one horned rhino was treated for an injury today in Kaziranga National Park. “The rhino was sighted by Forest Department personnel this morning in the Burapahar range; they noticed the injury and informed us,” narrates Phulmoni Gogoi, WTI-IFAW veterinarian. 
A team comprising veterinarians, Dr Phulmoni Gogoi (WTI-IFAW), Dr Bijoy Gogoi (Guwahati Zoo) and Assam Forest Department officials including the DFO, Kaziranga, and Rangers of Kohora and Burapahar ranges went to attend to the animal. The animal was sedated and treated. Initially, the wound was thought to be a bullet wound but on treatment it was identified to be an injury due to infighting, and the wound was still fresh. The whole operation took half an hour.
In addition to this incident, another case was attended to by Dr Rinku, who went to Nagoan Lanka range to rescue a one month old elephant calf. The calf was found alone, and had been abandoned near a railway line for the last two days. The herd was not traceable. “It has no external injury and appears normal,” says Gogoi. The calf is currently under care at CWRC.
