Brother of Camilla Parker, the Duchess of Cornwall, Mark was a crusader for elephants. He tirelessly campaigned for Asian elephants, helping efforts to conserve the pachyderms in India among other countries.
Since 2000, when he founded the Elephant Family, he organised and attended countless fund-raiser events including the innovative Elephant Parade in London.
“WTI expresses its deepest condolences on this untimely demise of an extraordinary human being and a very dear friend,” said Vivek Menon, Executive Director, WTI. “He was a staunch supporter of Asian elephants, and till the very last, worked to help save them. We have lost a stalwart, who was an inspiration with his endless energy and enthusiasm. The most suitable tribute to Mark would be to carry on his legacy and his vision, and the WTI family recommits itself to further the cause Mark lived and died for.”
