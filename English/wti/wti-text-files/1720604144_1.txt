Sondlagondi (Maharashtra): In an effort to reduce anthropogenic pressure in the crucial Nagzira – Navegaon corridor linking nine Tiger Reserves in the central India, the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) supported by the Japan Tiger and Elephant Fund (JTEF), has initiated eco-development activities in villages within the corridor.
With 89 villages within the corridor – a part of the proposed Nagzira-Navegaon Tiger Reserve, it faces increasing anthropogenic pressures and incidents of human-animal conflict. A survey conducted as part of WTI’s Central India Tiger Conservation Project in 2010, indicated Sondlagondi and Jammbalapani as the most critical of the nine villages shortlisted for immediate intervention to prevent further fragmentation of the corridor.
“Three biogas units and 30 eco-friendly cook-stoves were provided to families in Sondlagondi village with the support of JTEF to reduce their dependence on the forest,” says Greeshma Mahesh, WTI. “While the cook-stoves will reduce the fuel wood requirement by 40% and the biogas units will ensure zero fuel wood consumption in the beneficiary households. Soon to follow will be similar interventions in Jammbalapani, and consequently the rest of the identified villages.”
The biogas units and eco-friendly cook stoves were recommended by the Appropriate Rural Technology Institute (ARTI), a Pune-based organisation brought in to train the villagers on the use and maintenance. Apart from consuming less fuel wood, the cook stoves provided also offer a healthier option for the households, as it has a chimney to channelise the smoke outdoors.
The Central India Tiger Conservation Project, initiated in 2006 adopts a holistic approach for the conservation of tigers by capacity building of forest guards, litigation and policy level interventions, campaigns and close work with the communities.
