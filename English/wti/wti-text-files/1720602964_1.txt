Karbi Anglong: Three elephants were brutally killed by villagers near Nambor Wildlife Sanctuary since July, said conservationists in Central Assam. These deaths at close intervals have raised concern among elephant conservationists. 
In the first incident on July 10, a thirty-year old male makhana in Ouguri found dead with spear and gunshot injuries. The elephant was treated a week before near Shilonijaan by a veterinary team of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
The Honorary Wildlife Warden of Golaghat, Arup Ballav Goswami had requested WTI for treatment of the injured elephant.
According to Dr. Anjan Talukdar, wildlife veterinarian of WTI, “the animal may have been speared, then shot by miscreants resulting in his death.”
On the same day, another wild makhana was found dead in Shantipur near Shilonijaan with similar injuries.
In the third incident on August 18, a lactating female with three gunshot injuries was drowned in a swamp near Shilonijaan. “The bullet injuries on her spine had paralyzed the animal and could not emerge from the soft earth.” he said.
On July 16, the veterinary team had rescued a female – limping from spear injuries along with her calf at a field, close to the area. After treatment, the mother and her calf were reunited with the natal herd.
“Besides Karbi Anglong, Sonitpur and Golaghat districts of Assam have witnessed high incidence of human-elephant conflicts. Shilonijaan and Manja regions of the district require special attention.” said Ujjal Sharma, Project Officer of WTI.
Elephants, raiding crops have led to human-elephant conflicts and are seen as a major obstacle to their conservation. The Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) of WTI has been carrying out rescue and rehabilitation of wild animals in the region. The project is a collaborative work of WTI and the Assam Forest Department with support from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).
