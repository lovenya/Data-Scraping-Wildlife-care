Palakkad (Kerala): Ten wildlife traders were arrested between May 7th and 9th in three undercover operations carried out in Palakkad district, Kerala, by the Forest Department, assisted by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). A fish owl, two red sand boas and 24 kgs sandalwood were among the items seized by the authorities. 
Of the 10 traders, four were arrested on May 7th when they approached a decoy customer to sell the fish owl. The gang had reportedly sold two owls to buyers based in Tamil Nadu, recently. The red sand boas were smuggled for sale in Kerala by four other traders from Tamil Nadu. The remaining two traders were arrested on May 9th; the sandalwood and a gun suitable for big game poaching, were seized from this duo.
Jose Louies, Manager, PELT (Policy, Enforcement, Law & Training) programme, said, “Owls are captured from the wild and sold to black magic practioners, who use them in their rituals. Red sand boa, also commonly known as ‘double headed snake’ because of a blunt tail that looks like a head, has a myth of supernatural power associated with it; this seems to be the reason for the increasing demand of this snake in the illegal market. People should be cautioned against the false beliefs that lead them to exploit wild creatures.”
