Kaziranga, July 16, 2015: Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and Elephant Family with support from the Assam Forest Department distributed kits to the newly trained group of Green Corridor Monitors of the Kaziranga -Karbi Anglong landscape. Mr. S K Seal Sarma, Divisional Forest Officer of Kaziranga National Park was invited as the Chief Guest at the kit distribution ceremony and he inspired the young corridor monitors with his guidance.
Twenty youth from three different corridors who were recently trained in the corridor monitoring process received the kits that will ensure effective implementation of the project. Each kit comprises a rain-coat, T-shirts and flashlight – weather appropriate gear to help them through field work that follows a standardised methodology to document movement of elephants through these habitats.
WTI in a joint venture with Elephant Family is trying to develop a volunteer group Green Corridor Monitors for ‘Corridor Monitoring’ during floods with help from local youth. This ‘Corridor Monitoring’ process will help understand the status of displaced animals and provide adequate protection to animals in distress. These Green Corridor Monitors will keep an eye on animal movement, especially elephants.
