Shilonijan (Assam): In a freak accident, more than 800 Asian openbill storks, mostly chicks and juveniles, were killed as the banyan tree on which they were nesting collapsed on Monday night.

Sixty-one birds which survived were brought to IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation on Tuesday from Shilonijan in Karbi Anglong Autonomous District, where the incident happened.
“Most of the admitted birds are chicks and fledglings. Many are severely injured, with fractures on the wings and legs,” said Dr Phulmoni Gogoi, CWRC veterinarian, during a brief break from a series of operations on the rescued birds.
“About 26 birds have succumbed to their injuries; condition of 12 of the remaining birds is critical,” said CWRC veterinarian, Dr Prasanta Boro.
Arup Ballav Goswami, Honorary Wildlife Warden, Karbi Anglong, said, “The incident occurred on Monday evening. There was no storm, so we are trying to find out how the tree broke all of a sudden. Local botanists have been contacted to determine the cause.”
According to speculations the tree could have broken because of a combined effect of the weight of the birds and weakening of the tree due to termite infestation.
Goswami added, “This is the breeding season for these birds so the casualty includes a lot of young birds. We did not see any eggs, but about 15 or 20 juvenile birds were found alive by the locals today. The birds are not able to fly yet. However, they are safe as they are being looked after by the locals.”
Openbill storks (Anastomus oscitans) are not a scheduled or threatened species and are widely distributed in South Asia.
