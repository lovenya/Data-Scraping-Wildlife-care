Wayanad, April 24, 2014: As a part of the International Fund for Animal Welfare-Wildlife Trust of India (IFAW-WTI) Supplemental Accident Insurance Scheme, ex-gratia support of Rs 1,00,000 was provided to the family of Appu, a mahout with the Kerala Forest Department, who had been killed by a captive elephant on the evening of February 13, 2014, while on duty. 
“As a conservation organization Wildlife Trust of India is committed to provide its organisational support to the individuals who are working at the front lines. We know, the loss of a life can never be compensated but this small relief is a symbol of gratitude to the thousands of our frontline forest staff who risk their lives every day to guard the forest and wildlife across the country,” said Vivek Menon Executive Director, WTI, while re-iterating the organisation’s commitment to continue providing support to the guardians of the wild.
Appu had been working in Muthunga, Wayanad, with the Kerala Forest Department since May 5, 1999 and had been shifted to the elephant squad in 2001. He is survived by his widow and three children.

“We appreciate the support by WTI and this kind of timely support is a moral boost for the frontline staff, especially the temporary staff. Today we face multiple conservation challenges in the field and to keep the morale of the front line staff is very important,” commented Roy P. Thomas, Wildlife Warden – Wayanadu WLS.
Through the IFAW-WTI Supplemental Accident Insurance Scheme, which is part of WTI’s Van Rakshak Project, over 20,000 field staff across the country have been covered against death/permanent disability while on duty. The Van Rakshak Project has also trained over 12000 forest staff in more than 130 Protected Areas in over 19 states of India.
