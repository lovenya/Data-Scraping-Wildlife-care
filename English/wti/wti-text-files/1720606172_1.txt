Noida, 15th March: The Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), supported by the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), United States Department of State, conducted a four-day intensive training program from 11th to 14th March 2024. This programme aimed to strengthen the capacity of skilled professionals in managing wildlife crime and human-wildlife conflict in India. The overarching goal was to equip these trainers with the necessary skills and knowledge to subsequently train frontline forest staff working across different parts of the country. 
WTI acknowledges the crucial role played by frontline forest staff in mitigating human-wildlife conflict and preventing wildlife crime. These individuals operate on the ground, often in remote and challenging environments, where they encounter complex situations demanding immediate and informed responses. Hence, enhancing their capacity through specialised training becomes imperative. WTI organised this ‘Training of Trainers’ (ToT) workshop to build a cadre of trained professionals who can further carry out capacity-building workshops for the frontline forest staff. 
28 participants from WTI, other organisations and state forest depts attended a Training of Trainers program
 
ToT workshop was meticulously designed to cover a broad range of relevant topics. The curriculum was divided into two main categories: a general training module, which included topics such as training qualities, the training cycle, adult learning essentials, and communication techniques. Additionally, there was a theme-specific module, further divided into a ‘Conflict Mitigation course’ covering aspects like human-wildlife conflict dynamics, animal management strategies in conflict scenarios, and mitigation concepts, and a ‘Crime Prevention Course’ focusing on topics such as combating illegal wildlife trade, introduction to CITES, and Wildlife Protection Act and more.
A total of 28 participants from diverse ecological regions attended the workshop, each bringing unique insights and experiences to the training. This diversity enriched the learning environment, fostering collaborative problem-solving and the exchange of best practices. Moreover, the participants included not only WTI- field staff but also stakeholders such as forest department members, lawyers, University professors, and  researchers, ensuring a holistic approach to addressing conservation challenges.
Engaging presentations and interactive mock training sessions, providing participants with opportunities for active involvement during the workshop
During the training workshop, the participants were assessed on various parameters including pre-training and post-training tests, as well as delivering  mock training on relevant topics. Based on the evaluation, a list of Trainers has been established to facilitate ongoing capacity-building for frontline forest staff nationwide, spearheaded by WTI.
The workshop serves as a platform to develop skills and encourage teamwork in tackling conservation issues. Through detailed coursework, hands-on learning opportunities, and a training model that passes on knowledge to others, the program equips participants with the necessary expertise to make valuable contributions to wildlife conservation and law enforcement efforts across the country.
