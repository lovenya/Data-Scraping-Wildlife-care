In the serene yet unpredictable landscape of the Wayanad Wildlife Division of Kerala, tales of human-wildlife interactions are not uncommon. Among these stories, the experiences of Mr. Varadaraj and Mr. Venkidadas stand out as compelling narratives of resilience and courage.
Varadaraj, a member of a migrant family from Tamil Nadu, grew up in Tholpetty, Wayanad. He did his schooling till 2nd grade and spent most of his childhood in the fringe areas of Tholpetty and Begur forests. As he grew older, he began supporting the forest department with work such as helping in the installation of fences, clearing invasive plant species, logging, digging trenches, and putting out forest fires. His fondness for the forests and pride in his services led to his appointment as a temporary daily wage watcher in 2017. Despite the challenges, Varadaraj has been actively participating in guarding elephants, night patrolling to keep a lookout for poachers, and frequently visiting areas where wildlife encroaches on human habitations.
In a similar vein, Venkidadas, originally a farmer, faced severe financial difficulties due to inadequate water supply and frequent elephant raids on his farmland. In 2019, his persistence in assisting forest watchers paid off when he was hired as a temporary forest watcher at the Tholpetty range. Venkidadas’s dedication is evident as he gears up for night vigils, preventing elephant incursions, and assists with weed eradication, trench maintenance, and forest fire prevention during the day. His responsibilities extend beyond his job as he is the primary breadwinner for his family, which includes his wife and son.

Both men faced life-threatening incidents that tested their resilience. Varadaraj vividly recalls an unfortunate incident on the night of 20th October 2023. While attempting to drive away a lone tusker, a cracker intended to frighten it, exploded nearby, severely injuring his hand. He was rushed to the Government Medical College in Mananthavady, where surgeons had to amputate the tip of his left ring finger. Despite the shock of this harrowing experience, Varadaraj resumed work after two months, demonstrating extraordinary courage and determination. 
Varadaraj describes his job as exceptionally challenging, marked by frequent encounters with elephants and sleepless nights. Despite these hardships, Varadaraj remains committed to his work out of a deep-seated belief in Sevanam (service) for the benefit of both wildlife and people. He finds great fulfilment in his role, expressing a genuine passion for the forest and wilderness. Moreover, due to his disability, he feels inept in performing other jobs effectively.

Similarly, Venkidadas faced a harrowing encounter with a tiger on 9th February 2024. While carrying out his routine duty of monitoring elephants, he was momentarily alone when a tiger attacked from behind, resulting in severe injuries. His instinctive reaction to protect himself startled the tiger, prompting it to flee. He was admitted to the Government Medical College in Kozhikode, where he underwent surgery. Despite the physical and psychological trauma, his recovery was remarkable, and, he resumed his duties with the forest department.
Venkidadas describes his job as high-risk, fraught with constant fear of dangerous encounters with elephants, big cats, and venomous snakes. He often works in isolated areas at night, far from human habitation, which poses another threat to his life. Despite the absence of assurances or adequate protection—relying only on a torch and a billhook—he likens his duty to that of soldiers safeguarding the nation. His determination stems from a deep commitment to preserving the forest, wildlife, and the well-being of people. Venkidadas’ livelihood depends on this job, so despite the hardships, he remains steadfast in his belief that he can overcome these challenges and fulfil his responsibilities effectively.
