New Delhi: The much-awaited Animal Action Week 2007 is all set to fire the imagination of schoolchildren across the country. The fifth in its series in India, this annual event reaches out to impressionable young minds, aiming to generate awareness among children for wildlife conservation through campaigning, awareness-building measures and education. 
Each year, a different theme is chosen and activities surrounding the theme are carried out for a period of one week. Through specific activities, schoolchildren are made aware of the importance of wildlife conservation and to inculcate a feeling of love, sympathy and compassion towards animals.
 An initiative of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Animal Action Week was launched 15 years ago. The campaign runs in 15 countries, working closely with youngsters to educate them, create awareness and campaign for saving animals around the globe by taking action.
The Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) joined hands with IFAW in 2000 to create awareness and sensitize young minds about conservation animal rights issues. The week-long campaign will begin on October 1 this year with more than 100 schools across the country participating in exciting events like drawing competitions.
This year’s theme is “To the Rescue Emergency Relief for Animals.” Each participating school gets an activity pack that contains a CD with information on what thousands of schoolchildren around the globe are learning about emergency relief for animals.
The all-India painting competition is open to students from Class VI to IX from participating schools. Two selected national winners will be awarded the IFAW Young Achiever Award at the prestigious Venu Menon National Animal Awards ceremony on February 18, 2008. The winners’ paintings will be featured on the New Year greeting cards produced by WTI.
