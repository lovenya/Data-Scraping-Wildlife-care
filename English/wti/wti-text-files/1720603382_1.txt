Darjeeling (West Bengal): The verdict on the case against the two Czech nationals arrested for illegal collection of insects from Singhalila National Park in Darjeeling, will be announced on September 4, 2008, the Chief Judicial Magistrate has said.
The foreigners, Petr Svacha and Emil Kucera were arrested on June 22 from a hotel in Srikhola near Darjeeling. Hundreds of insects were recovered from their possession. They are accused of violating the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (WPA) and Biological Diversity Act, 2002, (BDA), by collecting protected insect species from within a national park without the required permits.
The arrest had drawn ire of international scientists who contested that the two Czechs were innocent and were only collecting the specimen for research. However, Indian officials during investigations, uncovered information on the accused making their motives appear suspicious. Their trial had begun on August 25.
