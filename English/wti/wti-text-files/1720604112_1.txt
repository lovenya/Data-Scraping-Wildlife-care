New Delhi: A wildlife trader arrested with three leopard skins in Delhi 15 years ago was today sentenced to a year in prison along with a fine of Rs 5,000.
Kishan Kumar was apprehended along with an accomplice Ranbir Singh (who passed away during the course of the trial) in 1996 in Delhi following a tip-off. The seizure and arrest was carried out by a police team comprising Sub Inspector Bharat Singh, Assistant Sub Inspector Phool Chand and Wildlife Inspectors KN Singh and Rajbir Singh.
“The second accused Ranbir Singh passed away during the course of the trial. Kishan Kumar was out on bail. He was convicted by the Court of the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (Special Acts) on the 26th of March 2011 and the sentencing was carried out today,” said Saurabh Sharma, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) lawyer who assisted the prosecution led by Delhi Government prosecutor Atiq Ahmed. “The minimum imprisonment for illegal trade in Schedule I species is three years today. However, the seizure was done in 1996 during which time the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, stipulated a minimum imprisonment of one year.”
