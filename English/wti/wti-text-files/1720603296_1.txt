Penguins being washed




Chubut (Argentina): The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) has successfully cleaned 66 penguins and 38 grebes, among the victims of the ‘Mysterious Oil Spill’ that was detected on December 26 last year in Patagonia, Argentina. More than 500 birds were estimated to have been killed as a result of the accident. 
The oil spill was first detected off the coast of Chubut, a province dependent on petroleum and fishery. A local newspaper had reported that the overall spill was made up of several slicks, along a total extension of approximately 40 kilometres. The clean-up process was led by the Argentine Navy and IFAW was requested to help manage the wildlife response.
Following the request, a team of veterinarians and oil spill responders was sent by the IFAW to rescue and rehabilitate the fauna. The IFAW team worked with the Fundación Patagonia Natural (FPN) on site and the Argentine Government who supported the development of an on-site facility as well as supplies and equipment needed, to care for the affected animals. Currently the centre is caring for about 430 birds including steamer ducks and Magellanic penguins which have been listed as near threatened by Birdlife International. Other species include the silvery grebes, cormorants and crested grebes.
Oil spill is one of the problems facing the marine wildlife today. The effects can be immediate and short-term or accumulative and long-term. The birds may suffer from hypothermia and loss of flight resulting from matting of the feathers.
Founded in 1969, IFAW works around the globe to protect animals and habitats promoting practical solutions for animals and people. IFAW is the international partner of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), an NGO that works to conserves nature in partnership with communities and governments.
