Rajaji: An elephant died of suspected poisoning near the Motichur Rest House in the Rajaji National Park. Some forest field staff found the tusker, around 14 to 16 years of age, when it was in a very weak condition and was bleeding from the mouth and anus, indicating that it was poisoned. However, only after a post mortem is done, the reasons for death can be confirmed. Last reports from Rajaji indicated that the park authorities were organizing the post mortem.This death is comes close on the heels of the death of two tuskers, which were poisoned by poachers, in the Ghori range of the park in December.
The poachers had used poisoned arrows to kill these elephants after which they had hacked off the tusks. The bodies of the elephants were found in a ditch.
The park officials had stepped up the vigil in the park by calling for some PAC troops to help them patrol the park, despite which no clues about the poachers have been found.
