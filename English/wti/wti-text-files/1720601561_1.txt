Tigers: ‘The                                        Italians’Date of Birth: N/A
            King, Royale, Harak and Zeudy were rescued                                          from appalling conditions by the Big Cat                                          Project. The five tigers had been confiscated                                          from an Italian circus and caged in a                                          tiny ‘beast-wagon’ for over 18 months.                                          The five lived at the Big Cat Sanctuary,                                          Kent and have now been re-homed at Bannerghatta                                          National Park.



                           
                          

                          
 
                              
 



Tiger: Ginny the tigerDate of Birth: Estimated                                          1986
            Ginny and her mate Bill were in very                                          poor health when they were rescued from                                          horrifying conditions in Limburgse Zoo,                                          Belgium. They had many happy months, enjoying                                          grass and trees for the very first time,                                          but sadly Bill”s health deteriorated                                          and he was put to sleep. Ginny missed                                          him dreadfully but was comforted by the                                          arrival of the ‘Italian Five’ tigers.                                          She too has found a new home in Bangalore.



                           
                          

                                                                                                                                                                                                  Tiger: RoqueDate of Birth: May ’98
Roque was only a few days old when he                                          was taken from his mother.  Weeks                                          later he was put on sale in a Spanish                                          pet shop. Many such pets end their days                                          confined in tiny cages by their inexperienced                                          owners.  Born Free was determined                                          to expose Europe’s cruel and largely unregulated                                          exotic pet trade.  Roque was rescued                                          in an undercover operation and a national                                          newspaper campaign highlighted his story.                                           Today Roque has been moved to his new,                                          large enclousre, designed as close to                                          `tiger habitat’ as possible, in Bangalore.
