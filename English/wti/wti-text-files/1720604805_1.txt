Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, Karnataka, March 3, 2018



Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) mourns the passing of S Manikandan (IFS),

Conservator of Forests and Director, Nagarhole Tiger Reserve, who died in

tragic circumstances at the age of 46 while on duty earlier today.
Shri Manikandan suffered fatal injuries in an

attack by a wild tusker while inspecting the damage caused

by a fire in the DB Kuppe Range of Nagarhole,

close to the Kabini backwaters.
WTIâ€™s field personnel had worked with

Shri Manikandan during Van Rakshak

training workshops and anti-snare drives

with frontline staff in Nagarhole,

and through our Mobile Veterinary Service unit

in the Bandipur-Nagarhole landscape. He was a devoted officer

and a field man through and through,

always on the frontlines of wildlife conservation.
Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family.
