New Delhi: More than 13 years after the seizure of 12 shahtoosh shawls by the Customs officials in the Indian capital, a complaint was filed last week against the accused party – the Cottage Industries Exposition (CIE).
The complaint was filed by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) on April 27, soon after the conclusion of adjudication by the Customs Department prompted by a Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) petition to the Delhi High Court.
The Customs department had seized the banned shawls -slated to be exported to the United Kingdom- in Indira Gandhi International Airport on November 11, 1996.
“The proceeding against the accused was given an interim stay order by the High Court in 1997, acting on a petition by CIE. The case lingered on in the HC till WTI filed an intervention application in 2006 leading to the dismissal of CIE’s petition. However, despite this dismissal in 2007, no action was taken. Subsequently, a writ petition was filed in this regard by WTI, last year,” said Saurabh Sharma, WTI lawyer.
The writ petition filed by WTI appealed for HC directions to the Customs department and WCCB to initiate legal proceedings against CIE. A status report submitted to the HC indicated that the WCCB had been carrying out detailed investigations with respect to the roles of CIE, Ishtiaq and Company (the company that reportedly supplied the shawls), and their respective heads.
On April 12 this year, the Additional Commissioner Customs, Delhi, passed an order against CIE imposing a fine of one lakh rupees for attempting to export shahtoosh, and an additional one lakh rupees as redemption fine.
“The seizure was done by the Customs, and without this adjudication, the WCCB’s hands were tied,” clarified Sharma. “Now, with the complaint filed, the case has finally been brought to track. We will continue to assist the WCCB in following this case. The next date for hearing has been scheduled for July 6.”
