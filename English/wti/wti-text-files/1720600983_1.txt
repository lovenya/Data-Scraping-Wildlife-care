Mr. N P Jayan spent months inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve documenting the reserve and its biodiversity in all its beauty, as well as the anthropogenic pressures caused by the Sabarimala pilgrimage on the reserve. Thathwamasi showcases Mr. Jayan’s work on the same. The photo-documentation was supported by Wildlife Trust of India’s Executive Director’s Discretionary Grant and the Kerala Forests and Wildlife Department.
