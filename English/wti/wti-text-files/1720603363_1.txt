Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh): The Police arrested three wildlife traders from a hotel in Saharanpur in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. Tipped off by an informer, the authorities made the arrest while the accused were in the process of trading eight leopard skins which were recovered from them.
The Uttar Pradesh Forest Department is in the process of filing charges against the accused Majid, Intkhab and Mohammad Imran who are currently under custody.
Investigation revealed that the skins were brought to Uttar Pradesh from the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand. The police has also arrested one Liaquat Gujjar who, it is understood to have supplied the skins to the accused. Sunil Chaudhary, Divisional Forest Officer, Shivalik, confirmed the arrest.
“The number and the frequency of these seizures are alarming. There are unconfirmed reports of two other seizures of leopard skins in this region. The details are awaited,” said Ashok Kumar, vice-chairman, Wildlife Trust of India.
Saharanpur reportedly has units where these wildlife articles are preserved in silica gel and formalin before being sent to Muzaffarnagar for onward delivery to Delhi.
