Valmiki Tiger Reserve, August 12, 2015: Under Wildlife Trust of India’s Supplementary Accident Insurance Scheme, Meena Devi, wife of Late Sunil Mahto, was handed over a cheque of Rs 1 lakh as an ex-gratia support. Mahto, a tiger tracker from Valmiki Tiger Reseve, had succumbed to injuries inflicted upon him by an Indian bison while on duty in June this year. He was posted in the Raghia Range of Valmiki Tiger Reserve, Division – 1, and had been working as a casual worker since 2009.
The cheque was handed over to Mahto’s widow by Mr Alok Kumar, Deputy Director, Valmiki Tiger Reserve, Division-1, in a meeting of Eco-Development Committee and VTR management in Manchangwa village. Mr Kumar said that the relief amount would be of great financial support to the bereaved’s family and also boost the morale of the frontline staff. He appreciated IFAW-WTI’s efforts to provide support to the family in such short time.
Sunil Mahto (41), resident of Manchnagwa village, succumbed to the attack by a gaur on June 2, 2015, when he was trying to drive away the animal from an agricultural field. The gaur had already injured a farmer and attacked Mahato on the chest and neck when he approached the animal. The sole bread earner of his family, he was rushed to hospital but breathed his last on the way.
IFAW-WTI runs India’s only NGO Supplementary Accident Insurance scheme, which brings all the frontline field wildlife staff in the country under an insurance umbrella, and cover them for Rs 100,000 on death and partial amount on permanent disability.
Today, 23 states have joined this scheme and more than 136 families in the last 15 years have availed this insurance. More than 20,400 field forest staff from across the country have been covered against death/ accident while on duty. The Van Rakshak Project has trained and equipped over 15,000 forest staff in more than 150 Protected Areas of India and trans-boundary areas of Bhutan.
