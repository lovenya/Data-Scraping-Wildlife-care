Manja, Karbi Anglong, June 8, 2015: A two month old female barking deer was admitted to the International Fund for Animal Welfare- Wildlife Trust of India run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) on Sunday, after all attempts to find the mother failed.
The fawn was found alone by members of a local NGO — Save Economic Wildlife Growth of Assam (SWEGA) — near Khaibung village in the vicinity of Singhason Hills of Karbi Anglong on Sunday and was brought to the central Range Office in Manja the same day.



SWEGA is active in anti-poaching activities in Karbi Anglong. Mr. Tongthang Touthang, President of SWEGA, said, “Our anti-poaching team found this fawn alone near the village and searched the area for a long time for the mother, but in vain. We then handed the fawn to the Forest Department to save it from potential harm.”
The animal was later handed over to the CWRC-MVS team for further care. Dr. Daoharu Baro, the MVS veterinarian, who attended to the fawn in Manja, observed that there were no external injuries. The fawn seemed healthy and is currently under observation in the small animal nursery at CWRC.
