Faridabad (Haryana): The Haryana environment court today resumed hearings in the criminal case against Mansur Ali Khan, also known as the Nawab of Pataudi and others for allegedly hunting a blackbuck in June 2005. This is contrary to the rumours being spread by certain people that he had been acquitted.
The trial had been delayed due to a legal technicality relating to filing of a charge sheet by the police as against a complaint that is required under Wildlife Protection Act. However, anticipating this eventuality a precaution had been taken upon the advice of Wildlife Trust of India’s legal advisor, Saurabh Sharma and complaint had been filed as well in Hindi. The charge sheet had been dismissed.
The accused Mansur Ali Khan and others were present in the court. Wildlife Trust of India has been made a part of the prosecution in this case following an order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. This may well be a first case under Wildlife Protection Act in which a NGO has been made a part of prosecution. Recording of evidence will commence on August 4, 2009.
