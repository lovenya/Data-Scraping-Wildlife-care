The rescued calf being taken to CWRC
Kaziranga, July 6, 2015: A neonate male rhino calf rescued by the Kaziranga Forest Department was admitted to International Fund for Animal Welfare – Wildlife Trust of India (IFAW-WTI) run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) for further care on July 6, 2015.
According to Selim Ahmed, Range Forest Officer, Agoratoli, Eastern Range, “A male rhino calf had been rescued by the staff of Balidubi anti-poaching camp from the flood waters in Behimtkatijan area inside Kaziranga National Park. Despite several attempts, the mother could not be located.”
The CWRC–MVS team, lead by Dr. Panjit Basumatary, rushed to Agiratoli Range and did a medical check up on the rescued baby rhino. After initial assessment by the team, the decision was taken to shift the calf for further care to CWRC — the IFAW-WTI wildlife care centre.

“The neonate calf has severe dehydration, but thankfully there were no external injuries or abnormalities. The calf will take time to regain normal body condition and has been kept under 24 hour observation,” said Dr. Panjit Basumatary. The neonate rhino calf has been shifted to a large animal nursery where vets will look after it for the next few days.
CWRC till date has attended to 33 cases of displaced rhino calves. Recently, three orphaned rhino calves hand-raised at the centre were radio collared and released at Manas National Park.

CWRC was established in August 2002 with a primary aim to stabilize displaced animals and release them back into the wild, as close to the site of rescue as possible, following necessary treatment. CWRC has handled over 3500 cases of distressed wild animals ( of over 230 species) essentially handling nearly one case per day since 2002.
