The sub-adult python had been rescued yesterday afternoon by a member of Nature’s Banyapran, a conservation NGO active in the Nagaon district of Assam. Sanjoy Chetry, an activist with the NGO said that the creature was found grievously injured, presumably due to digging activity being undertaken for the National Highway expansion at Solong (Dolapani). “We received information about the python from forest department officials in the area”, Chetry said, “and in consultation with (CWRC veterinarian) Dr Panjit Basumatary brought it to CWRC for further attention last night.”

The severity of the python’s condition suggested that it had been injured by one of the hydraulic excavators typically used for moving soil in road works. After observing it overnight, veterinarians Dr Samshul Ali and Dr Panjit Basumatary performed surgery on it this morning.



“The python was chemically restrained and the surgical intervention proceeded as per our plan of action”, said Dr Samshul Ali, who led the surgery. “As the injury was particularly severe it took about an hour to repair the wound.”

The reptile is currently under post-operative care at CWRC.
