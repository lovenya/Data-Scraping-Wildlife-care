New Delhi, May 20, 2002: The campaign against hunting of hornbills in Arunacahl Pradesh got a shot in the arms with the villagers of Basarnallah in Papum Pare district forming a forest protection committee to prevent the hunting of hornbills. WTI along with the Arunachal Wildlife and nature foundation (AWNF) distributed 26 fibreglass replicas of hornbill beaks and 40 awareness posters to the Gaon Burahs of Basarnallah.
Many tribal groups in Arunachal traditionally wear the hornbill beak as part of their headgear, to symbolize valour and manhood. WTI and AWNF have been campaigning against the killing of hornbills for this traditional use. Instead the villages have been offered firbreglass replicas, fabricated by WTI in New Delhi. The Itanagar DFO held a meeting with the village development council, during which the villages assured him that they would ban hunting of hornbills and protect the local forest area.
As a goodwill gesture, the forest department immunized 150 cattle and also provided vet treatment for various ailments of their cattle. The villagers were shown the film “Songs of the Forest” on hornbill conservation to create a sense of awareness on the issue.
The DFO has also invited the villagers to suggest effective alternatives so as to maximize the benefits to wildlife as well as to the villagers.
