Bhopal, 1 October 2019 : Munna the iconic tiger from Kanha reached young children through an illustrated book released at Van Vihar today. This handy little edition is full of coloured photos of tigers in their natural environment and caricature illustrations and is produced by the Madhya Pradesh Tiger Foundation Society (MPTF Society) and supported by Wildlife Trust of India.
Munna brings the life of tigers in “Baghon ki Kahani, Munna ki Zubani” into children’s homes through a lively narrative that covers the species and its conservation. The book is meant to be distributed to school kids across all Tiger Reserves and Protected areas of Madhya Pradesh.

Pages of photographs from wildlife photographers alternate with text in Hindi scattered with caricatures of flora and fauna make this attractive to the target audience of younger school children. Munna’s first person account in a style that resonates with children takes the reader through tiger behaviour, biology, threats to conservation and tiger corridors.
A lot of children from the nearby schools participated in the event. Sri A.P. Shrivastava, ACS (Additional Chief Secretary) of Forest and Dr.U.Prakasham, PCCF Wildlife, Madhya Pradesh also graced the occasion.
Dr Rajendra Prasad Mishra (Coordinator & Regional Head of our Central India projects) represented Wildlife Trust of India at the book launch. WTI has been working in the Vidarbha landscape to ensure connectivity of tiger habitats and has trained and equipped frontline forest staff across India to ensure protection of the species. Anti-snare walks, anti-poaching, ex gratia assurance to forest staff and working with communities in tiger landscapes are some of the key strategies implemented by WTI for holistic conservation.
