Ashok Kumar receiving Sanctuary’s Legend Award

Mumbai, 18th December 2015 – Ashok Kumar, Founder & Chairman Emeritus, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) was honoured with the Sanctuary Legend Award at the prestigious Earth Heroes event held at NCPA auditorium in Mumbai today. The Legend Award is a new honour started this year.
With a career spanning over five decades Ashok Kumar’s contribution to conservation is immeasurable. A pioneer in many ways, he was man the behind getting Sansar Chand, the most dangerous wildlife trader ever to have operated in India, behind bars. He set up TRAFFIC in India and it was under his reign that the first biggest seizure of tiger parts took place. This seizure marked an important milestone in tiger conservation in India.
At a time when nobody spoke about seeking protection for wildlife through tougher laws, he seeked to plug loopholes and pushed for effective implementation of wildlife laws. In 2002, following a case filed by him, protection to the Tibetan antelope was granted by banning shahtoosh shawl production. His strategy to engage the system even when he opposed it for a project or policy reason, showed dramatic results, facilitating better coordination between Forest Departments and enforcement authorities across the country.
