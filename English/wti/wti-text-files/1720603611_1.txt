Talap (Assam): An injured crested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela), found by a local in Talap near Dibru Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Assam, was treated and released by the IFAW-WTI run Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS), about a fortnight ago. 
Dr Abhijit Bhawal, IFAW-WTI veterinarian, said, “The locals who found it reported that the bird was attacked by crows. They mistook it for a brown fish owl. As they were aware of the upsurge in trade in this owl, they went to the Police. I was informed by the police personnel.”
The bird was treated for minor lacerations on the leg. It was released on August 16 in Dibru Saikhowa.
Crested serpent eagle is widespread across India, except in the northwest and in the Himalayan region comprising parts of the northeast. “In this region (Dibru Saikhowa), the sightings are rare,” added Dr Bhawal.
Since 2003, IFAW-WTI veterinarians have attended to 15 crested serpent eagles in Assam. Injury (due to unknown causes) was the reason for displacement in 11 of these cases. Ten of the 15 birds were released back in the wild following required interventions.
