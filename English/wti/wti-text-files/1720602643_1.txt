Kangra: A joint operation led by the Station House Officer (SHO) Shahpur of Himachal Pradesh Police and the Enforcement Division of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) have resulted in the recovery of two bear biles, three leopard skins and a jungle cat skin from two illegal wildlife traders in the state. A tip-off given to the police by a WTI associate resulted in the two arrests on the 6th November.
One of the traders was arrested from Dharamsala, where two bear biles were recovered from him. Following his interrogation, the police team in the Boh village of Kangra district conducted another raid, where three leopard skins and a jungle cat skin were recovered from a trader.
Presently, the two accused are in police custody and are being interrogated. According to Amlan Dutta, Asst. Programme Officer (Enforcement) WTI, “The two accused were booked under the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. The enforcement division of WTI will provide legal assistance to the prosecution to ensure that the culprits get appropriate punishment under the Act.”
The Enforcement Division of WTI has been monitoring the bear bile trade in the state since September following information on the bear bile trade in the state. Field investigations in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh revealed that the poachers were more active during the winter months due to lax enforcement.
Kangra valley, which is situated in the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas experience heavy snowfall, and landslides during winters and the region becomes inaccessible from the rest of the country. Poachers take advantage of the situation when they go for the kill. The Himalayan brown bears and the Asiatic black bears fall prey to these poachers.
Bear biles, skin, and claws are sold to prospective buyers through various clandestine routes of the region. The Enforcement Division of WTI hopes to continue their operations in other parts of the state in collaboration with the police and forest department.
