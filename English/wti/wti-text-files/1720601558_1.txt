Bangalore: For Ginny, Royale, Zeudy, Harak, King and Roque, six hybrid tigers(of Sibreian strain) rescued from captivity in Europe, the Bannerghatta National Park, has become their new home. On Monday (April 29, 2002) they were released into a brand new sanctuary, established near the National Park, especially for them.
The lifetime care facility has been established by the Forest Department, Government of Karnataka in association with Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and funded by Born Free Foundation (UK).
The tigers were released into the wild by award-winning actress and passionate animal welfare campaigner, Virginnia McKenna. The six tigers were transferred from the Big Cat Sanctuary, Kent, UK, on board a British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Chennai Airport
The tigers arrived in Chennai early on Sunday (April 28) morning. From Chennai they were transported in two trucks to Bangalore. The trucks were covered with thatch and constantly kept wet to keep the cages cool.
After a fairly bumpy eight-hour ride from Chennai to Banaglore, the tigers were taken to their new home outside Bannerghatta National Park. The tigers were kept in their cages, what will be their home from now onwards, to recuperate from the arduous journey.
The tigers were released into a small pre-release area, which has patch of lawn and some play things for the tigers like a wading pool an d some truck-tyres. Once they are fully recouped and adjusted to their new environment, they will be released into a larger area, which has been built to replicate `tiger habitatâ€™.
