Dholagaon (Assam): A slow loris (Nycticebus bengalensis) rescued from Dholagaon near Dibru Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary by the Assam Forest Department, was released following treatment by the IFAW-WTI Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) unit, last week. 
The loris reportedly lost grip while attempting to cross between two trees on a cable wire, and fell into a bush.
“A crowd gathered when they saw the loris walking on the cable. The loris must have slipped while it hurried to escape the gaze of the onlookers,” said Dr Abhijit Bhawal, veterinarian of the MVS, who accompanied the Forest Department officials during the rescue.
“It’s injuries were minor, and it seemed more shaken on seeing so many people, than due to the fall,” he added.
The loris was taken to the MVS field station in Dibru Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary for stabilisation. Its injuries were treated, and following two days of observation it was released in the wild in the Kayatia camp in Dibru Saikhowa.
A shy, nocturnal primate, slow loris is listed under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Main threats to lorises include habitat degradation, poaching for bushmeat and trade in parts for traditional medicines as well as in live animals sold as pets. In 2007, the genus Nycticebus comprising at least three species, was upgraded from Appendix II to Appendix I in the CITES database.
