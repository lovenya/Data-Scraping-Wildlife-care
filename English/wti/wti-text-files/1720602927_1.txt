Kokrajhar – Assam: A group of reformed poachers along with local residents have formed anti-poaching squads to protect the Chakrasilla Wildlife Sanctuary, known for its significant populations of the critically endangered golden langur (Trachypithecus geei) in the Kokrajhar district of the north-east Indian Assam state. 
The anti-poaching squads were formed by a local NGO, Discovery Club, in collaboration with the forest department for patrolling the 45 sq. km area of the sanctuary and in its surroundings.
Chakrasilla was notified as a wildlife sanctuary in 1994, which is home to a number of endangered species, like the golden langur, capped langur, Assamese macaque, rhesus macaque, leopards, barking deer, wild boar, various species of bats and rodents, mongoose among  others.. Deepali beel – a wetland located on the southwestern boundary of the sanctuary is well-known for its migratory birds.
Widespread deforestation, poaching and human settlements in close proximity have been the source of major threats to the sanctuary.
Discovery Club had requested Wildlife Trust of India’s (WTI) Wild Aid Programme to equip this anti-poaching force with essential personal equipment. Ten sleeping bags, five binoculars and flash-lights were recently provided, Dr. Sandeep Kr. Tiwari, Asst. Manager of WTI said.
Effective anti-poaching measures and long-term conservation of wild animals are being anticipated as a result of this initiative.
