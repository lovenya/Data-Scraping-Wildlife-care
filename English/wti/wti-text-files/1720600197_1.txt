CWRC, Assam, July 10, 2016: In a major update to the story published here on June 24 regarding the rescue of a Burmese python and its clutch of eggs by the MVS unit of IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), hatchlings have now been observed emerging from the eggs at the centre’s Small Animal Nursery.
Readers will recall that the female python and approximately 30 eggs had been rescued from an outdoor shed at the Assam Bangiya Saraswat Math (aka Shanti Ashram) in Kokilamukh. CWRC veterinarians Dr Panjit Basumatary and Dr Samshul Ali had supervised the ideal enrichment of a glass-sided box, placed in a partitioned room in the Small Animal Nursery, as a makeshift nest in which the female python could incubate her eggs.

Subsequent reports had indicated that the female had begun to brood in the nest. Now, it seems that the combined efforts of the centre’s rescue team and veterinarians have borne fruit – two hatchlings have emerged from their eggs. “This is a great success for us”, a visibly pleased Dr Basumatary said. “The mother python has been incubating the eggs in the artificial nest and we expect to see a few more hatchlings soon.”
In accordance with protocol, once all viable eggs have hatched the female python and snakelets will be released into a suitable environment back in the wild.
