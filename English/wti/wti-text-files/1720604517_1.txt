The orphaned bear cub was being cared for by a woman in the village of Belong, Arunachal Pradesh
Siang, Arunachal Pradesh, June 29, 2017: A female Asiatic black bear cub, just three to four months old, was handed over to a Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) team of the Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) – the rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility for Asiatic black bears established in Pakke Tiger Reserve by IFAW-WTI and the Arunachal Forest Department – on June 25.
The cub had apparently been found alone in a corn field near Belong village in the Siang district of Arunachal a month ago. The villagers said that they had waited in vain for its mother to appear before eventually picking it up. A local woman had diligently fed and cared for the cub until the forest department, upon learning of the situation, convinced the villagers to hand it over to the CBRC team for its betterment.
The cub is now under care at CBRC. “We have placed her under observation for the time being. If all goes well she will join two other cubs at the rehabilitation site in August”, Dr Rinku Gohain, the centre’s veterinarian said.
