CWRC, Assam, October 3, 2017: A three-month-old female elephant calf that had been found stuck in a drain in Misa Tea Estate, Nagaon Wildlife Division, was rescued by frontline forest personnel and brought to CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park) earlier today.
“Our team located the natal herd and made several attempts to effect a reunion, but the calf was not accepted by the herd” said Suvasish Das, DFO, Nagaon Wildlife Division.
Reports from the field indicate that a herd of about 30 elephants was passing through the tea estate on the fringes of North Diggoo Reserve Forest last night when the female calf got stuck in a drain. Its mother and natal herd tried in vain to extricate it before moving on towards the hills in the north. Frontline personnel from the North Salna Forest Range were able to rescue it this morning with the aid of some local people. “Our team located the natal herd and made several attempts to effect a reunion, but the calf was not accepted by the herd” said Suvasish Das, Divisional Forest Officer, Nagaon Wildlife Division. “Therefore, for the welfare of the baby elephant, it was transferred to CWRC for long-term care and rehabilitation.”
CWRC veterinarian Dr Samshul Ali conducted a preliminary examination on the calf when it arrived at the centre. “It was mildly dehydrated and had some inflammation of the genital area”, he said. “It has been housed in the Large Animal Nursery and is being provided oral rehydration. It will remain under close observation until it has been stabilised.”
With this new addition, there are now thirteen orphaned elephant calves being hand-raised at CWRC in the hope of eventual wild rehabilitation.
