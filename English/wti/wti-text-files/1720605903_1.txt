Home to over 1900 elephants spanning three elephant reserves and having 12 identified elephant corridors, Odisha plays a crucial role in the preservation of these majestic animals.  The ‘Gaj Utsav’ campaign aims to rally various stakeholders such as policymakers, media, infrastructure agencies, legal professionals, and wildlife experts to collectively combat human-elephant conflicts, safeguard crucial elephant corridors, navigate legal challenges concerning elephants, raise awareness and promote coexistence.
