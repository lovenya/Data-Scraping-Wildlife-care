5th July 2019, Adobe India initiated a nature trail for their team of volunteers in partnership with Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). Group of 45 enthusiastic volunteers from Adobe India were a part of this green initiative at Okhla Bird Sanctuary with birding guides, naturalists and other officials from Wildlife Trust of India. This initiative is an example of how a corporate can join hands with conservation-oriented not for profit organizations, thereby promote the values of biodiversity and sensitize their employees on the ecological importance of wildlife and its habitat.
