Kaziranga, January 30, 2016: An injured female hog deer rescued from Dhansiri-Hahchora village under Numaligarh forest beat of Golaghat district on January 27, 2016, was released in Kaziranga National Park on January 29, 2016.
Pratap Saikia, senior forest official and beat officer, informed the CWRC team that the animal was rescued from a human habitat with a leg injury. He claimed that the animal was found limping in the village when rescued.
On receiving the information, the MVS team reached the spot and shifted the animal to CWRC –IFAW-WTI run wildlife care facility– for care.




Dr Panjit Basumatary, the IFAW-WTI veterinarian, who attended to the deer, said, “She had Hypoderma spp larvae in subcutaneous tissue with an injury in the right foreleg. The animal was given the necessary treatment and recuperated shortly afterwards.”
After clinical intervention, the female hog deer responded to medication within a day. On January 29, the team released her at the Agoratoli forest range of Kaziranga National Park. It was also fitted with an ear tag which will help in post release monitoring by the forest officials.
CWRC has handled over 3500 cases of distressed wild animals (of over 230 species) essentially handling nearly one case per day since 2002 when the centre was established.
