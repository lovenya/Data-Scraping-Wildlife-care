Dudhwa, April 29, 2013: The Rehmankhera tiger captured from the outskirts of Lucknow last April after having kept conservationists and locals on tenterhooks for several months, has now successfully spent a year in the wild in Dudhwa landscape.
The tiger had lived nearly three months in a small patch of forest in Rehmankhera amidst populated settlements. The feline had not attacked people, but had lifted cattle although it also regularly took on wild prey. Possibilities of chance encounters had compelled pre-emptive action by the Forest Department authorities, for the welfare of people as well as the animal.
Accordingly, the tiger was captured by the Forest Department assisted by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI)’s UP Carnivore Conservation Project team. The Project is now supported by Aircel Limited.
The adult male tiger was released in pre-selected area of South Sonaripur Range, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR). It was fitted with a satellite-VHF collar for post-release monitoring.
“Our biologist Krishnendu Basak had monitored the tiger after its release. The animal had moved a large area in the first fifteen days post-release. Then, just when we thought he was settling down, on the 31st day he again started moving and finally settled on the Sathiyana grassland area preferring it as a more viable resource area,” said Dr Anil Kumar Singh, Regional Head (UP), WTI.

WTI had earlier similarly captured, and released a tiger in Manas in 2010; this tiger was recently sighted after more than 1000 days in the wild. Dr Ashraf NVK, Chief Veterinarian of WTI commented, “The Dudhwa tiger and Manas tiger translocation successes go on to show that we still have habitat to accommodate such individuals, and that not all tigers sighted in human settlements are ‘conflict’ tigers.”
