Darjeeling (West Bengal): Two Czech citizens including an entomologist of national repute were arrested from Srikhola in Darjeeling district, West Bengal, on Sunday for possessing rare insects. About 500 beetles and two bottles containing preserved insects (in different stages of growth) were seized from them. 
The entomologist Petr Svacha and forester Emil Kucera, who are currently under judicial custody, were arrested by a team of forest department staff led by Utpal Kumar Nag, Assistant Divisional Forest Officer of Wildlife Division 1. Acting on a tip-off, the team raided the room rented by the foreigners in a local hotel and seized the insects and equipment including a GPS, a pendrive, a high resolution camera and chemical preservatives.
Their collection included certain species listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They reportedly collected the insects from in and around Singhalila National Park in the Darjeeling district.
During interrogation, the duo claimed that the collection was for research and not for trade. However, they were detained as they lacked permits or documents to corroborate their statement.
Ashok Kumar, vice chairman, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) said, “Insect traders have been arrested in India in the past too. Few were outright traders while others, researchers. But, under Indian law, even a scientist requires permits for collection for research purposes, without which it will be treated as an offence.”
A case has been filed under Section 9 of the WPA that prohibits hunting of wild animals belonging to Schedule I, II, III and IV.
“They had applied for a bail but it was denied. The hearing has been scheduled for July 7, 2008. Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) will be assisting the prosecution in this case,” Saurabh Sharma, WTI lawyer, said.
