Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary, Sonitpur District, Assam, 19 April 2015:
Two wild buffaloes hand raised at the IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), were released back to the wild in Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary (BWLS) this Sunaday, 19th April 2015.The two buffaloes were shifted from CWRC to a pre release boma at BWLS on 18th March 2015 for acclimatisation.



Released buffalo – back to the wild 

Burachapori WLS falls under category 4 of the IUCN protected area management list and has a resident population of Asiatic Water buffaloes. Following the buffalo release protocol, the CWRC, IFAW-WTI team led by Dr. NVK Ashraf, Senior Director, IFAW-WTI and the team of veterinarians and animal keepers along with Ms Dimpi Bora, IFS, ACF, BWLS, opened the boma to release the buffaloes in the sanctuary. After the release, both the buffaloes explored around two kilometers of the forest and took shelter near the release site in the evening.

 “It is a very successful release after one month’s acclimatisation of the buffaloes inside the pre-release boma. I think both WTI and forest department have done a wonderful job.” said Ms Bora who was present on site.

Providing more details about the process, Dr Ashraf said, “This is the first time we are releasing a pair comprising a male and a female. Also the first time we have demonstrated that a prior exposure to live wires at the rescue centre will be enough to deter the animals from touching the dummy wires erected at the release site. We could get away with a temporary bamboo stockade by merely ‘reinforcing’ it with two strands of dummy wires”.
The IFAW-WTI team of a field biologist and animal keepers and the staff of Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary will monitor the buffaloes for a stipulated time.
