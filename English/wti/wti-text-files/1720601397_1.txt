Jodhpur (Rajasthan):Salman Khan finally surrendered before police Saturday following a non-bailable warrant issued by the Jodhpur session court Friday after he failed to attend the court proceedings where his five-year jail term was upheld by the court.
 He was taken into custody today soon after he arrived at the Jodhpur airport from Mumbai.
He was accompanied by his lawyers and his relatives including his actor brother Sohail Khan.
The court upheld the five year jail-term given by the Chief Judicial Magistrate last year for killing an endangered Chinkara in 1998 â€“ one of the rare antelopes protected by the Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.
At the airport, hundreds of his fans some on motorcycles cheered him and accompanied him to the local prison even as he was being led by the police.
