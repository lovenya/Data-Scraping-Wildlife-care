WTI, IFAW & Elephant Family Respond to the Controversy around the Numaligarh Refinery Video
“WTI, IFAW and EF are shocked to see the moving video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Dzkr5cz8c) of elephants being blocked from their ritual right of passage by a wall that lies around property of the Numaligarh refinery. It is important to demolish this particular long wall and remove the barbed wire completely. Existing structures of the NUMALIGARH refinery impeding the movement of elephant should be shifted. No new structure should be planned and executed in the elephant habitat. We strongly encourage NRL to also implement it in a time bound fashion according to the conditions laid down in the environmental clearance of 1991. WTI, IFAW and Elephant Family uphold the conservation of elephant and its habitats and corridors in highest esteem and would oppose any act that impinges on this basic principle.”
