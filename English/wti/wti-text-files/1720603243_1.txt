Sunheri Masjid (North Delhi): Two Shikras (Accipiter badius), one alive and another dead, were seized from a youth in the capital last Thursday, while he was waiting for prospective buyers near Sunheri Masjid, about 200 metres away from the nearest police station. The arrest was made by Delhi Wildlife Inspectors along with representatives of People for Animals (PFA) and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), who tipped the police. 
The accused, Ajim Khan, a resident of New Friends Colony, had the two birds hidden in his bag when the arrest was made by the team including Wildlife Inspectors RR Meena and VB Dasan, Saurav Gupta of PFA and WTI staff – Dinesh Pandey and Prasenjeet Navgire. A motorcycle was also confiscated from the accused.
Dinesh Pandey, Assistant Programme Officer in the Policy, Enforcement, Law and Training (PELT) Programme of WTI, said “We noticed the person sitting anxiously on his motorcycle. The team approached him on foot and grabbed him. The PCR was then informed about the operation, and a van arrived immediately to arrest Khan.”
Wildlife Inspector, RR Meena, said, “The accused was produced before the Tis Hazari Court today. His bail was denied and he is currently in judicial custody.”
The birds were produced as evidence during the hearing and the one alive has been released following court order.
Shikras are placed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972). They are captured and smuggled to middle-east countries, where they are sold as pets to be used in a sport in which they are made to prey on smaller animals.
