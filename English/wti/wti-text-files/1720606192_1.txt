Kaziranga, 16th April 2024: A late-night visit from a King cobra measuring approx. 10-foot-long  left a family in Panijuri village of Burapahar range, Kaziranga National Park in shock.
Identified as an adult male, the highly venomous snake was discovered coiled behind an almirah. Concerned for their safety, the residents immediately alerted the Range Forest Officer, who in turn contacted the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation & Conservation (CWRC) team, jointly run by the Assam Forest Department, WTI & IFAW, for emergency help.
The cobra was found coiled under an almirah
Two of our trained rescuers rushed to the location and carefully retrieved the cobra using the necessary snake-handling equipment. Subsequently, it was brought to CWRC for thorough examination.
Dr. Bhaskar Choudhury, Division Head, Wild Rescue and Head Vet NE, WTI and his team carefully microchipped the snake before releasing it back into the wild. Since the establishment of CWRC in 2002, our team has released 27 king cobras back to their original habitat and microchipped 5 individuals for identification purposes.
We are thankful to the public for refraining from hostility towards the snake and, instead, choosing to close the doors and windows of the house while awaiting our rescue team.
Locally known as “Roja Feti” in Assam, the King cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is the world’s longest venomous snake and can grow up to a length of over 18 feet. It is also the only snake species that builds nests on the ground where it lays eggs. In India, it is primarily found in the Western Ghats, Orissa, Bengal, and Assam in addition to other areas including the Terai landscape. King cobras predominantly prey on other snakes. It is believed that their fondness for rat snakes is one of the reasons for their ‘straying’ into human-dominated areas.
