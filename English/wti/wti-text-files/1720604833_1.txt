CWRC, Assam, March 27, 2018: A male elephant calf, about five to six months old, was admitted to CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park) on March 23 after it was discovered alone near Lahorijan in the Karbi Anglong district of Assam.
According to the Forest Beat Officer of Lahorijan (Karbi Anglong East Division), villagers from Hajarpur had, over the course of a week, observed the calf roaming on its own in the vicinity of their village with its natal herd nowhere to be seen. They captured it and took it to their village to care for it, and when they intimated the forest department it was taken to the Lahorijan Beat Office.
As the calf’s condition was deteriorating, the Beat Officer informed CWRC. Dr Samshul Ali, CWRC’s Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) veterinarian, conducted a preliminary examination at the beat office. “The calf was stressed and dehydrated when I examined it”, he said later. “It had not received proper food or care for a week and since no elephant herd had been seen in the area, we decided that it should be shifted to CWRC for its welfare. It was transported under sedation through the foothills of Karbi Anglong East to the centre.”
The calf was kept under observation in isolation for 72 hours. It is now showing signs of stabilisation and is responding to milk formula. Once stabilised, it will be introduced to other elephant calves under care at the centre.
