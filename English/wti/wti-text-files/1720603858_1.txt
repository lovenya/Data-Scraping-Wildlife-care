Diphu (Karbi Anglgong): The Forest Department authorities of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council in collaboration with 5th Rajputana Rifles, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) supported by Whitley Fund for Nature (WFN), and other NGOs initiated a reforestation drive earlier this week to restore parts of encroached land in Marat Longri Wildlife Sanctuary.
The ‘integrated greening program’ aims to plant 50,000 saplings of native tree species to recover forests lost to encroachments in Tesobai and Tichom Arong areas along the sanctuary’s northern border. The plantation that began on Sunday, saw a participation of members of the implementing agencies in addition to local volunteers.
Abhijit Rabha, IFS, Conservator of Forests, while launching the plantation, said that this was the first time as many trees were being planted in Karbi Anglong. Stressing on the importance of reforestation in view of the extent of tree-felling going on, Rabha recounted a popular saying, encouraging the cheering participants to plant trees. “When the going gets tough, the tough gets going,” he said.
“There are about three or four villages, comprising about 10-15 families each, that have been living along this area and practising agriculture for over two decades. It will not be easy to relocate these people. However, without waiting for this uncertain and long-term possibility, the plantation was carried out in areas that are no longer being used by these people,” said Dr Anthony Phangcho, WTI veterinarian based in Diphu, Karbi Anglong.
“A total of 10,000 saplings of native tree species were provided by WTI-WFN,” Dr Phangcho added.
In addition to plantation, a painting competition was organised to raise awareness among school students. A total of 179 students participated in the competition organised in Bokolia Higher Secondary School.
