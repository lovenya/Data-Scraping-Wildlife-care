Jaisalmer – Rajasthan: Tonnes of cattle feed and vaccines were provided as emergency relief to the flood affected Gaale village in Jaisalmer district last week in the Western Indian state of Rajasthan, a WTI official said. 
This is one of the several villages affected in the recent floods in the state which had not received any help.
More than 11 tonnes of fodder was supplied and nearly 3500 livestock were treated during the week-long relief operation initiated by the wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
According to official figures, nearly 45000 livestock are suspected to have been affected in the district, since the floods in August; however, locals estimated it to be more than 1,00,000.
In Gaale village, 800 cattle were initially estimated for relief, but their figures increased after additional cattle which had been sent to forage elsewhere have returned, Rajeev Pillay of WTI who was part of the relief team said.
For the first time in recorded history, the state experienced severe flood affecting more than thousand villages in Jaisalmer, Barmer and Jodhpur districts. The incessant rain which continued for a week, submerged many areas.
“The unique topography of the affected districts made the situation worse, as the gypsum rock underneath the top soil does not allow water to percolate down.” Prajna Paramita Panda, Programme Officer of WTI said.
In some parts of Barmer, as the water level reached 20 feet above the ground, human bodies were found trapped on tree trunks, Panda said. Flood waters had to be tanked in goods train for releasing it into Luni River in Barmer.
The current initiative was carried out under the Emergency Relief Network of WTI and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).
