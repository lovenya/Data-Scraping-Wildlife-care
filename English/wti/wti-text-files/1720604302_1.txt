Karbi Anglong, June 18, 2013: A free Medical Health Camp was organised for local people in Kalapahar-Doigurung Elephant Corridor dependent villages last Friday. 
Implemented as part of the Karbi Anglong Conservation Projec by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), supported by Elephant Family, IUCN-Netherlands and Japan Tiger Elephant Fund (JTEF), the programme was carried out in collaboration with the Chokihola Primary Health Centre and the NRHM unit, Chokihola, Nilip Block.
Nearly 160 patients were seen by the medical teams from the Chokihola Primary Health Centre and provided treatment where necessary. After the camp, nearly 200 mosquito nets were distributed amongst the corridor dependent villages – Sar Kro, Ram Kiling and Ram Terang – by the village headman.

“We have been working with the local people to secure the Kalapahar-Doigurung elephant corridor. The people here have given us tremendous support and have been making sacrifices to help secure the corridor. During our work, we realized that this area is heavily-infested with mosquitoes and they have limited access to medical facilities. So we organised this camp for their welfare,” said Dr Anthony Nokso Phangcho, Lead – Karbi Anglong Conservation Project. After this camp was held, some people were even detected with malaria and provided treatment, he added.
