Faridabad (Haryana): Additional charges were framed today against Mansur Ali Khan, also known as the Nawab of Pataudi, and his accomplice Shashi Singh during the hearing of the black buck hunting case they were embroiled in since 2005.
The former international cricket player was arrested with seven others in June 2005 for hunting endangered wildlife and was later released on bail after three days in prison.
On the last hearing held on November 5 last year, an application was moved by the public prosecutor BL Soni, to add the two charges under the Arms Act, 1959. The presiding officer of the Special Environment Court, Judge Rajendra Singh Dhanda, after hearing both sides decided in favour of the prosecutors and charged both the accused under sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act, 1959.
Saurabh Sharma, counsel for the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), who assisted the chief prosecutor said “If pronounced guilty of these charges (under Arms Act), the accused can face a punishment of three to seven years along with fine (as per court’s discretion).”
On June 5 2005, Pataudi was booked under section 9, 39 and 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Following his booking, the vehicle used was recovered from his residence in Delhi along with two weapons. Carcasses of a black buck and two hares were seized from his Gypsy vehicle at the time of his arrest.
“Wheels of justice are slow but sure,” said Ashok Kumar, Vice-Chairman, WTI. “The next date of hearing of the case is scheduled for April 28 this year,” he added.
Black buck is an endangered animal and falls under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Conviction for killing this species attracts three to seven years of imprisonment.
