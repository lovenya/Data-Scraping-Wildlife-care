The “Whale Shark Rescue Application” has been exclusively developed for the fishermen to document the safe rescue and release of Whale sharks encountered during their fishing activities. The fishermen showed great cooperation and enthusiasm to contribute to the conservation of these vulnerable species.
On the same day, a sensitization program was also organized for the fishermen community of Aayikkara Harbour. The main focus of this program was to raise awareness about the importance of conserving vulnerable species like Whale Sharks and other marine megafauna.
In attendance were a total of 45 fishermen, who had the opportunity to interact with the WTI team and share their experiences of encountering these majestic creatures while fishing in other parts of India.

Mr. Charan Kumar, speaking at the event, highlighted that the campaign initially began in Gujarat in 2004, which successfully ended hunting activities. However, he also emphasized that accidental entanglement remains a significant threat to these filter feeders. He urged the fishermen, as the “children of the sea,” to take up the responsibility of saving this world’s largest fish. His call to action was to pledge to rescue these gentle giants and release them safely into the waters if they ever get entangled in nets.
Mr. Haris Thayyil, a representative of the fishermen community, expressed his heartfelt appreciation for the efforts made by WTI to protect the World’s largest fish. He assured that the community would do their best to safeguard their home and the diverse marine species that inhabit their waters.
