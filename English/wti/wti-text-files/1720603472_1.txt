Alipurduar (West Bengal):  The Additional District Judge of Alipurduar, West Bengal, yesterday rejected the appeal of Ratiram Sharma, the notorious wildlife trader, upholding his conviction and sentence, announced by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipurduar, on November 24, 2006. Sharma had been sentenced to an imprisonment for five years and a fine of 10,000 rupees but was out on bail.
Variously nicknamed ‘rhino-man’ and ‘Sansar Chand of northeast India’ for his involvement in trade of wildlife articles, particularly of rhinos, Ratiram was arrested on July 14, 2006. Four leopard skins, 140 pieces of rhino skins, 125 pieces of tiger bones and a skull were recovered from his house by Forest Department officials.
Utpal Kumar Nag, Assistant Divisional Forest Officer, Wildlife Division I, West Bengal Forest Department, said, “Following several bail plea rejections, he was granted bail on medical grounds (he is about 73 years old). Now that the court has dismissed his appeal, he will have to serve his remaining term. He could approach the High Court, but we are hopeful that he will be granted no leniency. Several other cases are also pending against Ratiram.”
Saurabh Sharma, a Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) advocate, who was the state-appointed prosecutor during the trial, called the dismissal of the appeal a major victory in wildlife related litigation.
The duration between Ratiram’s arrest and conviction as well as sentencing in 2006, had taken less than five months, making the case one of the shortest in Indian wildlife crime history.
