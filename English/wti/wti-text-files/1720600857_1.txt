The camps was organised with aim of developing an ‘immune belt’ of  healthy livestock in and around Dudhwa Tiger Reserve to reduce the risk of spreading infectious disease from domestic to wild animals. Since the villagers often drive their livestock inside the forests for grazing, the risk of disease outbreak to wild animals increases.  Therefore, it is vital to evaluate and treat these cattle against common livestock diseases and ailments. A total of 411 animals including cattle, goats, sheep and poultry were examined and treated by the WTI project veterinarian Dr Saurabh Kuma Singhai. for various health problems like, fever, diarrhoea, allergies, skin diseases, ecto-parasites, endo-parasites and different kinds of wounds. Medicines for the treatment of sick animals were provided to livestock owners.
 
Dr Saurabh Kumar Singhai said “Any disease outbreak amongst the big cats will be a big setback to the conservation efforts to save the dwindling population of this majestic species. WTI on its part is taking every possible step to ensure that this does not happen.”   
 
The Project team has been following up on domestic cattle health check-ups frequently as the villages’ border the Tiger Reserve and the big cats have been spotted in the vicinity of the villages.
