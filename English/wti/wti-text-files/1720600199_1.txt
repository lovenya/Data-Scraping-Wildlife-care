Haryana, July 07, 2016: A poacher was arrested with four leopard skins at Chandi Mandir, Haryana, on June 28 following a joint operation led by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and Central Bureau of Investigation, and supported by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI). The operation was unique in that it marked the first time that multiple enforcement agencies and NGOs had come together to crack a case involving the illegal wildlife trade.
Mani Ram Bawariya, age 52, had been suspected of hunting four leopards from an area near Bhagwanpur in Haryana. Under the supervision of WCCB’s Rameshwar Singh Thakur, the operational team studied the poaching network’s modus operandi and laid a trap that led to Mani Ram’s arrest as he was transporting leopard skins to the railway station at Chandi Mandir. The entire operation was led by RS Sharath and Mrs Mineekshi, Sub Inspector, CBI, Delhi (Unit V).
During his interrogation, Mani Ram admitted to having hunted animals with jaw traps near his home town, and revealed additional points of activity and locations in which other illegal wildlife items had been secreted. He also told investigators that he believed the safest way to transport illegal wildlife goods was on foot.
A case has been registered under various sections of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The CBI team is handling the follow-up investigation and legal process.
