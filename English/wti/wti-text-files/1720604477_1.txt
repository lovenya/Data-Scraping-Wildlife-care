Jewellery for Jackals: Three Indian jackal pups being rehabilitated at CWRC each received an earring in anticipation of their eventual wild release
CWRC, Kaziranga National Park, May 24, 2017: Rescued in late March by a Mobile Veterinary Service unit of CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park), three Indian jackal pups under care at the centre each received an earring for post-release monitoring yesterday.
The jackal pups will soon be shifted to a temporary enclosure in the Panbari Reserve Forest as part of their soft release plan.
The pups, two females and a male, were discovered at a construction site in the Rajabari area of Bokakhat Town on March 23 and 24. Just two months old at the time, they were brought to CWRC for care and rehabilitation and have since been housed in a specialised enclosure at the centre.
“The earrings will assist us in post-release monitoring”, said Dr Panjit Basumatary, veterinarian-in-charge at CWRC. “We conducted a health screening yesterday and found all three pups in good shape. They have gained weight and exhibit healthy reflexes. We will shift them to a temporary enclosure in the Panbari Reserve Forest in a few days as part of their soft release plan. Live prey will be provided to develop their hunting skills in situ. If all goes well and they demonstrate the ability to survive on their own, they will eventually be released into the wild.”
