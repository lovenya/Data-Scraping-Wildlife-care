New Delhi: The Court of the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dig Vinay Singh, yesterday convicted a wildlife trader Bishan Singh, arrested in the Indian capital in March 1997. The sentence is scheduled to be announced on April 5.
Singh was arrested with an accomplice Mukesh Kumar, on March 3, 1997 from Majnu-ka-tila, by the Delhi Police. Two pieces of desert cat skin and a glove made of fishing cat skin were recovered from them. Wildlife conservationist Vivek Menon – currently the Executive Director of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) – was called in as an expert to identify the skins.
“Both accused were on bail. Mukesh Kumar has reportedly jumped bail and escaped. He has now been declared an absconder,” said Saurabh Sharma, WTI lawyer who assisted the prosecution.
Both desert cat (Felis sylvestris) and fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) are listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
