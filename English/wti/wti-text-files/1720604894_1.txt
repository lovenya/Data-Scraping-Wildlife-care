Similipal, 13 July, 2018:Under its Vets on Wheels: Similipal Tiger Reserve project, the Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) unit established by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) held a series of awareness-cum-training programs on best management and ethical practices of wildlife rescue and rehabilitation. The programs were held in the forest divisions of Anandapur, Balasore,Baripada, Karanjia and Rairangpur last month.

These programs are aimed at developing on-field expertise in the frontline staff of the forest department. The central idea of the program was to discuss the basics of wildlife rescue and rehabilitation. The program also had mock drills to demonstrate appropriate management ofwildlife emergency and conflict situations. They were conducted under the guidance of Dr.Piyush Soren, Forest Veterinary Officer, Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR). Through five programs held last month, over 200 foresters were trained under the Baripada circle of Similipal Tiger Reserve.

WTI has been organizing these programs here for the last three years with support from Similipal Forest Department. With another program planned for STR (Core) Division in the coming days, the MVS unit will complete covering all six divisions of Similipal Tiger Reserve. An advanced training for selected frontline staff from each division will then be conducted in September.
