CWRC, Kaziranga National Park, June 20, 2016: A male Asian elephant calf, about two months old, rescued from village Chessa I, Papum Pare district, Arunachal Pradesh, was admitted to IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) last night.

The calf had been separated from its natal herd by a flash flood on June 16; it was rescued by villagers and frontline forest staff and sent to Itanagar Biological Park for stabilisation. The Chief Wildlife Warden of Arunachal Pradesh subsequently determined that it should be shifted to CWRC for rehabilitation, whereupon IFAW-WTI’s Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) was called in.

“The calf was in fairly good physical condition when I examined it at the Biological Park”, said Dr Jahan Ahmed, the MVS veterinarian who supervised the animal’s transfer from Arunachal to Assam. “It was sedated for the journey and brought to CWRC last night.” 
The calf was kept under observation at the large animal nursery overnight and given oral rehydration therapy and milk formula. This morning he was introduced to other elephant calves being hand-raised at the centre.
