Guwahati (Assam), November 23, 2012: Despite the devastation created by two big floods in the Kaziranga National Park this year, the population trend of Eastern Swamp deer is still stable, experts said.

 
A day-long monitoring exercise was conducted yesterday by the Assam Forest Department with support of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and WildlifeTrust of India (WTI).

 
“We monitored the species yesterday and counted 864 in a single day which is an encouraging figure, especially after a series of big floods in the park,” said NK Vasu, the Director, Kaziranga National Park.

 
“This was a monitoring exercise through which we tried to find its presence, and its area of occupancy. After the flood they get scattered. Once they consolidate before the start of the mating season in April we will conduct an official estimation,” he added.

 
This is the third estimation within a span of two years in which WTI is supporting the national park authority. These exercises have been supported by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Ltd.

 
In the first estimation in April 2011, the park recorded 1168 eastern swamp deer while the last estimation in January 2012 recorded a figure of 1108 deer.

 
“Regular monitoring of population trend of Eastern Swamp deer in pre and post breeding season is very crucial to know the ecology of the species. The current exercise will be followed up with another in March-April next year. With this exercise we shall also know their dispersal areas after the big flood,” said Dr Rathin Barman, Senior Advisor, WTI.

 

The estimation was conducted in all the ranges- Kohora, Bagori, Agaratoli and Burhapahar and North Bank. More than people, including a group of trained forest officials, representatives of non-government organizations, local villagers and media representatives took part in the exercise today along with 14 elephants said Robin Sharma Research Officer Kaziranga National Park.
