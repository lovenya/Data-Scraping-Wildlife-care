“The calf is severely dehydrated and weak,” he observed. Adequate clinical support was provided and the calf was kept under observation in the large animal nursery. 
The new calf has subsequently been introduced to another calf that is undergoing hand raising as part of the rehabilitation protocol to reduce the stress factor and ease the rehabilitation process.
