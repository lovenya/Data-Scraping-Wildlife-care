Jodhpur (Rajasthan): A Jodhpur bench of the Rajasthan High Court Wednesday deferred the hearing of Salman Khan’s bail appeal and asked his lawyers to approach the Registry for listing the case.
Khan’s lawyers approached the bench of Justice H. R. Pawar today, after Justice G. K. Vyas refused to hear the appeal on the ground that he had defended one of the co-accused in the case when he was a lawyer.
At this moment, the matter has not been listed for tomorrow’s hearing, unless the Registry notifies it later in the day.
Wildlife Trust of India’s lawyer, Dr. Mahendra Singh Kachawa who has been assisting the prosecution since the beginning of the case said, “Defense lawyers after heeding the advice of Hon’ble Justice Pawar forwarded the petition to the registry for listing.”
“There is little chance now for the case to be listed for tomorrow, since most part of the day has already passed, though the listing as well as the hearing may take place same day depending on the Judge.” Ashok Kumar, Vice Chairman of WTI, said. “Salman Khan may have to spend few more days in prison before the matter comes up for hearing.”
Last Friday, the District Session Judge in Jodhpur upheld the five-year-jail term given by a lower court against him for killing an endangered antelope (Chinkara) in 1998.
He surrendered before police next day following a non-bailable warrant issued by the court for remaining absent from court proceedings.
His close relatives, including his parents and actor brother Sohail Khan are said to be in Jodhpur for giving him moral support.
