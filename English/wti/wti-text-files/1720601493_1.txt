Motichur (Uttarakhand): An Indian rock python that had strayed into a culvert in Motichur, Naibasti area was rescued by the Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS- Uttarakhand) of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) with the help of the Forest Department staff on Friday (November 16) afternoon. It was later released in the Motichur range area after necessary health clearance from the veterinarian of the MVS.
The python had taken shelter under a culvert over an irrigation drainage system. Few local boys among the crowd which had gathered to get a glimpse of the snake had tried scaring the snake using fire. However, the MVS reached the site before the snake could be harmed. They immediately informed the Forest Department, and the Beat Officer Mangal Singh arrived shortly with four forest guards.
The frightened snake was caught after it came out of its hiding once the crowd of spectators was controlled. The snake was examined by Dr Pallabi Bhagawati of the WTI and was released near Rajarani River in Motichur range after she declared it healthy enough. “The snake was moulting and was therefore naturally relatively inactive”, she said. It was about 15 feet in length and weighed about 35 kg.
According to one of the spectators, “this irrigation drainage system opens in the nearby paddy field where the children play and bathe”. The Beat Officer claimed the rescue to be a major achievement as last year, a python weighing about 25 kg was killed by the villagers of the same area fearing safety for their children.
There are two species of pythons found in India. Both of the species, the Indian rock python and the Burmese python are placed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972).
