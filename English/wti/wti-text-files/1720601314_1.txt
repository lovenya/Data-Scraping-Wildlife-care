New Delhi: The Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), as a part of its Van Rakshak Project, provided a great morale booster to all field staff in protected areas, by providing them with an insurance cover.
The scheme was launched on March 30, 2001, and covers all 50,000-field staff in India’s protected areas. This landmark scheme brings all the field staff of the forest departments, working on wildlife duties in protected areas, under a single insurance scheme.
The scheme covers employees of the rank of range forest officer and below on field wildlife duties. Even temporary employees who have been on the rolls for at least three years and are on field wildlife duties are eligible.
