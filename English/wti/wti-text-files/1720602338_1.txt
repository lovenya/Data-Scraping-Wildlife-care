NEW DELHI: Those of us who were concerned by the 15 leopard skin seizure on Indo-Nepal border on 1st April 2003 and larger seizures of leopard skins which have continued over the last few years will be shocked by the latest seizure of 109 leopard skins in Kathmandu last week possibly on 3rd April 2003.Also seized were 14 skins of deer, possibly barking deer. All were destined to Tibet. Police arrested Pasang Chhimbel Lama, who said he was to take the goods to Tibet under instructions from a Tibetan. We have a part of the story and will get more details shortly from our associates in Nepal.
The biggest seizure of leopard skins, 89 in numbers, in our record is one which took place at Kharibari (District) Darjeeling in December 1994. The 70 leopard skin seizure at Khaga in UP on 12th January 2000 also had 18020 leopard claws which account for 1001 leopards. There have been other large leopard skin seizures in recent months.
The photograph of the seizure shows a horrible scene of carnage filling a whole room
