CWRC, Kaziranga National Park, August 14, 2017: Working in concert with a Kaziranga Forest Rescue unit, the Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) team of the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) – IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park – rescued a stranded female rhino calf, about six months old, from a flood affected village earlier today.
The calf had taken shelter in the backyard of a home in Na Jan village near Bagori, the Western Forest Range of Kaziranga. The rescue team comprised WTI Joint Director Dr Rathin Barman, CWRC veterinarians Dr Daoharu Baro and Dr Santosh Kumar Gupta, and Dr Debabrata Phukon of the Kaziranga Forest Authority, WTI’s Amitabha Choudhury, and CWRC animal keepers Tarun Gogoi and Raju Teron.
The calf is under observation at CWRC’s Large Animal Nursery. It has been introduced to another recently rescued rhino calf of similar age, which it is hoped will reduce the stress levels of both calves.
