Azamgarh (Uttar Pradesh): Acting on a tip-off given by Wildlife trust of India, forest officials confiscated a five-year-old sloth bear from a house in Azamgarh District in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh last Thursday.
The Divisional Forest Officer, S.N Mishra had ordered his colleagues to raid the house of Esar in Chatwara Kalandar Basti and to confiscate the bear.
Though the owner managed to escape, one of his accomplices Mohammad Kadar was detained by officials following a chase in an open yard behind the house.
The bear’s canine had been knocked out and its muzzle was found pierced.


Kalandars pierce the muzzle to insert a thick rope, by means of which they control the animal.
A case has been registered against the absconding Kalandar under various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.
The bear was later sent to the Lucknow zoo as per the directions of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests(Wildlife).
In September 2005, the Chief Wildlife Warden had cancelled the licenses issued to Kalandars between 1983 and 1986 and asked them to surrender their bears.


In 1998, Government of India had banned the bear dancing profession of the Kalandars.
“Kalandars know that it is illegal to conduct bear shows, but they still do so because of the easy money,” said Mr. Dinesh Pandey of WTI who was part of the raiding team.
