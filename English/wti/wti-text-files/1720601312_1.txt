New Delhi: The Rapid Action Project cell received a request from the Field Director of Satkosia WLS in Orissa for providing rain suits to anti-poaching field staff. It has been noticed in the past that during the monsoon the forests are most vulnerable due to their relative inaccessibility . Communication networks break down, roads get damaged and the vegetation is so thick that it is difficult to penetrate the forest. The poaching and timber mafia take advantage of this to wreak havoc on the forest. Monsoon is therefore the time when forest staff needs to be at full alert to tackle any contingency. It was felt that due to lack of proper rain gear staff found it difficult to patrol the area in heavy rains. WTI has decided to give immediate relief in the form of 80 rainsuits to the patrolling staff of Satkosia WLS. The aid given will be courtesy a grant from Jindal Steels, a private corporate donor.
Satkosia WLS is an important gharial, tiger and elephant habitat of Orissa. More than 12 tigers are present in this area apart from nearly 300 elephants.The state government has proposed this area as a tiger reserve to be taken up under Project Tiger .
