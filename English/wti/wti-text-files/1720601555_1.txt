New                            Delhi: Dudhwa Tiger Reserve                            is faced with a piquant situation. The dominant male                            rhino , Baanke, has been fighting so much for his females,                            that he has ended up killing two rivals and injuring                            many others. His extreme behaviour has the Forest Department                            worried, as not only are they losing prime males but                            also, Baanke has sired all the rhino offspring in Dudhwa.                            Officials are concerned that this narrowing gene pool                            will lead to inbreeding.Baanke is one of the greater one-horned rhinos translocated                            from Assam to Dudhwa NP in 1984.Vexed by Baankeâ€™s obsessive                            behaviour, the forest department in Dudhwa has come                            up with a solution. They are planning to translocate                            Baanke to another area at a cost of Rs 10 lakh. The                            new area is located on the fringes of the park and covers                            about 17 sq km in Bhadi range of Dudhwa. At present,                            all the 17 rhinos are located in a 30 sq km fenced-off                            area in the Kakraha range of Dudhwa.
The great Indian one-horned rhino was formerly extensively                            distributed in the Gangetic plain, including the Terai                            grasslands and Dudhwa. However, due to extensive hunting                            and habitat loss, only a few pockets of rhino poulations                            exist. They are restricted to parts of Nepal and north                            West Bengal and Assam. In Nepal, they are found to the                            east of the Gandaki River in Chitwan National Park,                            from where they have been now been reintroduced to the                            Royal Bardia and the Suklaphanta national parks.
In                            1984-85, rhinos from Assam and Nepal were relocated                            to Dudhwa, in an attempt to bring the rhino back to                            this region, which has grassland, swamps and wooded                            forests, the perfect habitat for rhinos. The project                            has been fairly successful with the original group of                            seven growing to 17. However, the planned soft release                            has not happened and the population is kept in fenced                            areas. Bhadi Tal and Churela Tal are two of the areas                            most suited for the rhinos in the Dudhwa NP, as they                            offer a combination of grasslands for food, wooded forests                            for shade and shelter and shallow wetlands for wallowing                            and foraging.
Ashish Tiwari, Deputy Director, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve                            points out: "Genetic inbreeding has become a problem                            and with Baanke out of the way, the other males may                            get a chance to mate." Tiwari is also hoping to                            get permission to translocate more rhinos from Assam,                            with a part of the population moving to Bhadi with Baanke."We                            would also like to get more rhinos in Kakraha, after                            Baanke and a few rhinos are moved to Bhadi," says                            Tiwari.
However, it may not be easy to strike a deal with either                            Assam or Nepal. Assam has refused to part with any more                            rhinos, and Nepal might prove too expensive as last                            time India had to gift 16 elephants to Nepal in exchange                            for four rhinos.
Besides, this move has met with some doubts from onservationists                            who question the wisdom of shifting more rhinos into                            Dudhwa. "The motive to give the rhinos a new home                            was that there be a new viable wild population of rhinos,                            in a place other than the north-east. But these rhinos                            are enclosed, defeating the purpose of the experiment,"                            says a conservationist.
Answers Tiwari, "the rhinos are free-ranging,                            the enclosure is just for additional protection to prevent                            the rhinos from straying in the field and giving rise                            to man-animal conflict. The enclosure also encourages                            intensive patrolling, which is necessary since the rhino                            is a prized animal for poachers."
Only about 2500 greater one horned rhinos remain in                            the wild.
