Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) mourns the passing of Mr Ratan Lal Yadav,

employed by the Chhattisgarh Forest Department as a casual worker in

Udanti Wildlife Sanctuary, on March 19, 2017 at the age of 55.
 The late Mr Yadav hailed from the village of Dumarpadao. He had been working with the

forest department in the North Udanti Forest Range for 15 years and had been

associated with WTI’s Central India Wild Buffalo Conservation Project

as a tracker since June 2016.
 Mr Yadav died on duty while tracking an adult male wild buffalo that charged

and fatally injured him. “He was one of our best trackers”, said Dr Rajendra Mishra,

WTI’s Regional Head (Central India); “a hardworking man completely devoted

to his work. His death is a tragedy and has been a shock to us all.

Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family.”
