New Delhi : “Honour among thieves” came to light when signatures and stamps were found on seized leopard skins certifying approval of the quality. A large consignment of leopard and otter skins was intercepted and seized by the Delhi Police on 6th April 2005 . Many of the leopard skins had a rubber stamp on the back saying “O.K. Tested, W-7”, a seal, and of course signatures in Tibetan.
“Signatures in Tibetan language have been seen in many seizures of tiger, leopard and otter skins in the past, but this is the first time a quality approval stamp has been seen. Have things come to such a pass that a factory-like operation of a quality control inspector is now operating in this trade?” questioned Ashok Kumar, Senior Advisor and Trustee of Wildlife Trust of India.
This is a new dimension to the well established trade in tiger and leopard skins operating from India to Tibet mostly through Nepal . Currently the Indian government does not have an organisation which can control even a fraction of this trade which puts a question mark on the survival of wild tiger in India .
A letter petition filed by WTI Trustee Ashok Kumar to Hon’ble Justice Arjit Pasayat came up for hearing today, 12th May 2005 at the Supreme Court of India as IA No. 1323 /2005. The three judge bench was both horrified and amused at seeing the photograph of the quality control stamp on a leopard skin.
In a lighter vein, Mr. Harish Salve who is the amicus curie said that there is honour even among thieves. The bench ordered that the 6th April 2005 case should be transferred to CBI for investigation.
In a reply filed in response to the petition, Union of India said that the decision to create a “Wildlife Crime Bureau” has been made and the process of inter ministerial consultation in underway. Other issues raised in the petition will be heard after the court resumes after summer break.
