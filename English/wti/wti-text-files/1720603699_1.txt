Kaziranga (Assam): A wild elephant calf, stuck in a mud pit at a tea garden near Kaziranga National Park in Assam, was rescued and reunited with its mother, by the Assam Forest Department in an effort assisted by IFAW-WTI (International Fund for Animal Welfare – Wildlife Trust of India).The male calf, about four years old, was found trapped in the mud pit at Kanchanjuri, Bagori Range, Kaziranga. The distressed mother, which remained in the vicinity of the trapped calf, reportedly damaged a bicycle as curious onlookers approached the calf.

“The mother was nearby and would respond to the calf’s calls and try to approach the pit every time it called. The forest guards kept watch and even fired in the air to scare away the mother, while we tried to rescue the calf,” said Dr Phulmoni Gogoi, IFAW-WTI Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) veterinarian, who attended the rescue. Dry earth was poured into the pit to enable the calf climb out on its own. 

“The calf was healthy, just a bit fatigued by its repeated efforts to extricate itself from the slippery mud in the pit. However, as soon as it emerged from the pit, it started chasing us. It eventually headed off to follow its mother,” Dr Gogoi said. 

Every year a number of Asian elephant calves are separated from their herds due to natural or human-made causes in Assam among other Indian states. IFAW-WTI, through its MVS units in Central and Lower Assam, has attended to seven wild elephants this year, of which five have been released after necessary interventions.
