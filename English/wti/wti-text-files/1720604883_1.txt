Dudhwa National park, Uttar Pradesh, May 31st  2018: As part of the Rapid Action Project (RAP) initiated by Wild Aid division, with the support of CAF India, the front-line forest staff of five ranges of Dudhwa National Park were provided with First aid kits (100 nos). The front line forest staff face a plethora of challenges while daily patrolling forests. Often located in remote areas the on-ground staffs face life-threatening situations and do not have the liberty of medical assistance. These customized first aid kits will thus help address any immediate medical emergency in the camps. The staff will also help provide first aid support to nearby villages as and when required.
