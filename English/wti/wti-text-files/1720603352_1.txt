Darjeeling (West Bengal): The trial of the two Czech nationals accused of illegal insect collection began today at the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Darjeeling. 
Two witnesses were examined in the hearing. The witnesses- Bharat Kumar Thami, a forest guard who had accompanied the Investigating Officer during the arrest, and Tsering Sherpa, the proprietor of Hotel Goparma from where the duo were arrested, supported the story of the prosecution.
“The charges will be framed after two days,” said Saurabh Sharma, advocate, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), who is assisting the prosecution in the case.
The foreigners, Petr Svacha and Emil Kucera, were arrested from their hotel room in Shrikhola near Darjeeling on June 22 for collecting insects from Singhalila National Park without relevant permits. Live and preserved insects and collecting equipment were among the articles seized from the accused during the raid organised by the West Bengal Forest Department.
Following their arrest, they were kept in judicial custody for about a month before the court decided to grant them ‘interim’ bail. The conditions on the bail set by the court restrict their movement to Darjeeling.
