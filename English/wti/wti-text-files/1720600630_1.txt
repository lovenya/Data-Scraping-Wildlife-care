Agoratoli, Kaziranga, May 1, 2015: A 13-foot long King cobra was put back to the wild by the IFAW-WTI RUN mobile veterinary service unit of Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) at the eastern range of Kaziranga National Park.

Locally known as “Roja Feti” in Assam, the King cobra, the world’s longest venomous snake, was spotted in the backyard f a small private tea garden near Burhapahar range of Kaziranga National Park. The villagers were agitated with the reptilian’s presence and wanted it to be taken away from the area. The King cobra was at the moulting stage during which snakes shed their skin and rarely move. However, the locals captured the snake and handed it over to the nearest Ghorakati forest camp of Kaziranga National Park on April 23.
On getting the information from the Burhapahar Range, the CWRC IFAW-WTI MVS rushed to the site and the snake was brought to CWRC the same day. Dr. Panjit Basumatary examined the snake and declared that it was indeed moulting. Initial examination revealed that snake weighed 8kgs and was 13-feet long.
