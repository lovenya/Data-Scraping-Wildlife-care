The Government of India has followed the                            example of the USA, Australia, the Philippines and other                            countries by declaring the whale shark a protected species                            and banning the whale shark trade. The shark (Rhincodon                            typus) is the largest living fish in the world with                            the largest so far having a recorded length of 18 metres.                            The species has just been included in Schedule I of                            the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972, rendering                            the capture and killing of the fish a cognisable offence.                            For a fully updated list of species protected under                            the Act see New Schedules.
The whale shark, the first fish species                            to be included in the Act, is hunted in large numbers                            off the Gujarat coast, for export to South-East Asia,                            Japan, the UK, and the USA. According to wildlife film                            maker Mike Pandey, who has won the Green Oscar for his                            film on the species, 1,200 of them were killed during                            the recent six-week fishing season. The fish is found                            in all tropical and warm temperate seas other than the                            Mediterranean.
All parts of the fish (the meat, fins,                            liver, cartilage, skin, and viscera) are used commercially,                            and the main processing centre is Veraval in Gujarat.                            However, it is the liver that is the most important                            item in the commercial trade, while oil from the fish                            is used for water-proofing boats. The government was                            until now reluctant to extend protection to the species,                            for two reasons: first, fisheries is a subject handled                            by the Ministry of Agriculture and not the Ministry                            of Environment and Forests; and second, because officials                            were not sure they would be able to enforce any protective                            law.
WTI suggests that two strategies be followed,                            both of which can help convert the fishermen of Gujarat                            into protectors of the whale shark. First, they can                            be encouraged to turn into vigilante groups and take                            up whale shark watching. Secondly, the habitat of the                            fish off the Gujarat coast can be turned into a marine                            sanctuary, and if "dive tourism" is simultaneously                            developed, it can provide an alternative livelihood                            to the fishermen, just as Australia has done.
