Dudhwa, December 18, 2013: WTI set up a livestock immunisation camp in three fringe villages of Dudhwa National Park, as part of the UP Carnivore Conservation Project, supported by Aircel Limited. 
Led by WTI’s biologist Dr Devendra Singh and veterinarian Dr Saurabh Singhai, the camps went on for three days, between 12th and 14th December in the villages of Bankati, Bhura and Sariyapara. A total of 513 livestock, mainly cattle, were vaccinated against foot and mouth disease, which has been reported earlier from the area.

The vaccination team members also spoke to villagers who brought their livestock to the camp about diseases their animals are most susceptible to, and how best to prevent them. To cover all livestock of the area, the team also did a door-to-door inspection to vaccinate animals that had been left out.
Dr. Saurabh Singhai said, “The immunisation was mainly done to prevent diseases from being transferred from cattle to wildlife when they go into the forest to graze.”
The UP Carnivore Conservation Project has been assisting  the UP forest department towards reducing human-animal conflict in the Dudhwa landscape and aims to increase the awareness among people about issues related to wildlife conservation.
