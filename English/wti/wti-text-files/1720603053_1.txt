Corbett – Uttaranchal: In a first ever attempt to chemically immobilize a wild elephant in Corbett National Park, a team of forest officials and veterinarians sedated a 4000 kg jumbo to treat his fatal wounds. 
This became the first wild elephant to be treated in the Park’s history.
Dr. Bhaskar Choudhry wildlife veterinarian of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) stationed here was invited by the park officials to carry out the immobilization operation.
Rajiv Bhatarai, Park Director, S. K. Chandola, Chief Wildlife Warden and other forest officials were also present during the exercise.
The forty-year old elephant had been suffering from severe injuries in his legs which affected his movements.
Choudhry said, “Prior to this step, dose of antibiotics were given through a remote syringe projector to control the infection. However, after several days of observation, immobilization was recommended to examine his wounds closely and to rule out any threat to the animal.”
A group of doctors from the G. B. Pant University of Pant Nagar in Uttaranchal along with Choudhry performed this operation.
The next day the animal was provisioned with sugarcane and other fodder as advised by the team of veterinarians. Presently, the animal is on the road to recovery.
Corbett is country’s oldest National Park (1936) and home to about 650 wild elephants.
A Mobile Veterinary Unit was put into service by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) to assist the forest department in undertaking rescue and rehabilitation measures.
