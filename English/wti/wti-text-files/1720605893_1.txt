Deputy Director of Valmiki Tiger Reserve, Division-II, graced the occasion by inaugurating the various activities. In his address, he emphasised the significance of International Tiger Day and the crucial need to conserve tigers for maintaining ecological balance. The honorable MLA, being a resident of Valmikinagar, shared inspiring insights into the journey of the tiger reserve. He highlighted how, during the late 20th century, the reserve faced a grim situation with almost no tigers. However, through persistent efforts, the tiger population has now reached an impressive 54 individuals in 2023. He lauded the collective efforts of the Valmiki Tiger Reserve management, along with civil societies like WTI and WWF-India, grassroots organizations, and most importantly, the support and active participation of local communities. The increasing tiger population and sightings have significantly contributed to the economic development of the region. However, he also expressed concern about the rising instances of wild animals venturing into human habitations, leading to conflicts and casualties on both sides.
Mr. Subrat K. Behera, Project Head of WTI, addressed the gathering, shedding light on the vital role of public representatives in tiger conservation. He earnestly appealed for their support in reducing human-tiger conflicts, combating poaching, curbing plastic use, and promoting effective waste management in neighboring villages. Encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices, such as improved cook-stoves, responsible agriculture, and better livestock care and management, he urged the public representatives to allocate budgets in their respective Gram Panchayats for eco-development activities.
