CWRC, Kaziranga National Park, July 19, 2016: A male Asian elephant calf, about one-and-a-half months old, was admitted to IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) for treatment and care on the afternoon of July 17.


The calf had been found alone near Lumding in the Nagaon district of Assam by a forest staff patrol, said M Dahal, Range Forest Officer, Lumding. “Our patrolling team discovered the calf on the Diphu-Lumding road early in the morning of July 16. They searched for its herd, but in vain.”

The forest department called in Dr Daoharu Baro, veterinarian with WTI and the Japan Tiger and Elephant Fund’s (JTEF) Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) unit stationed at Diphu, to take charge of the calf. On reaching the location Dr Baro, IFAW-WTI veterinarian Dr Brindavan Phangcho, and local veterinarian Dr Talukdar took the requisite steps to stabilise the calf. A reunion was considered later that evening but as there was still no sign of an elephant herd in the area, was deemed pointless.


“We noticed that the animal was severely dehydrated, debilitated and emaciated”, said Dr Baro. “Its legs and abdominal regions were also covered with dried mud, which led us to conjecture that it had fallen into a drain or trench and, because of illness, could not catch up to its natal herd.” In keeping with protocol the calf was taken to the WTI-JTEF Wildlife Rescue Centre at Diphu for overnight observation and, the next morning, shifted to CWRC under sedation for further treatment.

The calf is now under the care of Dr Panjit Basumatary, the centre’s lead veterinarian. It is being stabilised through medication and is under 24-hour observation at the Large Animal Nursery.


With this new admission there are now 12 elephant calves being hand-raised at CWRC.
