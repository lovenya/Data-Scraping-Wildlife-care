Delhi: More than 100 cubic feet teak, believed to have been illegally-procured, was seized today by authorities at the Old Delhi Railway Station. The teak was sent from Diphu, Assam, through cargo via Brahmaputra Mail. Further investigation is on-going. 
The seizure was jointly done by Delhi Police, Railway authorities and People for Animals staff. The wood blocks and a few bundles of wood strips were reportedly transported on the pretext of being used for making photo frames.
Dinesh Pandey, Assistant Programme Officer, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), who was called to identify the wood, said, “Teak (Tectona grandis) is an expensive forest species and an excellent timber. Limited extraction is permitted as per the working plans of the respective forest departments. However, the fact that it was declared as wood strips, but included block wood too raised the suspicion.”
“According to railway authorities, such cases are commonplace and that this was a rare seizure. This is a serious issue if true, as this indicates that the forests are being illegally cut down to supply wood at cheaper rate to the market,” added Pandey.
