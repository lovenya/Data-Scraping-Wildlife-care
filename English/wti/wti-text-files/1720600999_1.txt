Kaziranga, June 20, 2014: A female elephant calf recently rescued from Jia-Bharali river in northern Assam by local people, has been admitted to the IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) for rehabilitation.

The calf was found struggling in the river due to the current when sighted by the local people. After rescue, they alerted the forest officials at Charduar Range Office.


The reunion was not possible as the herd could not be located.

IFAW-WTI veterinarian Dr Jahan Ahmed, based nearby, was called in to attend to the elephant. “The calf is about a month old and was naturally stressed and dehydrated. She also had small injuries on her shoulder. We provided basic treatment and moved her to CWRC for specialised care,” he said.

The calf was moved 150 km to CWRC in the Mobile Veterinary Service under the care of Dr Ahmed, accompanied by IFAW-WTI animal keeper Deba Mushahari and Dandadhar Deka of the Assam Forest Department.
