New Delhi : The first pictorial Field Guide to Indian Mammals was launched today by the internationally renowned  field biologist, Dr George Schaller, at a packed ceremony attended by the conservation fraternity who came from far.










‘Many field guides have been coming out on the birds of the Indian subcontinent and continue to appear, but there has not been even one attractive and comprehensive field guide to the mammals of India. This book, the first one in 50 years, is an important addition to the natural history of India,’ Dr Schaller said while releasing the book.
Heavy on information, but low on jargon, the book compiles years of research with inputs from more than thirty reputed field biologists and covers appearance, behaviour, habitat, food habits, conservation status and, most importantly, the best places to see the species. The book’s editorial board consists of venerable names of Indian field biology and zoology like Mr J.C. Daniel, Dr Ajith Kumar, Dr A.J.T. Johnsingh, Dr O.P. Nameer and Dr Anwaraddin Choudhary.
