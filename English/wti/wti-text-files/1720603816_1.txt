Delhi: The Court of the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (Special Act), Delhi, has sentenced shahtoosh trader Ishaq Baig to one year in prison along with a fine of 5000 rupees.
Baig was arrested in March 1999 in Delhi. Ten shahtoosh shawls were recovered from his possession. He was convicted on January 11 this year. The sentence was announced by the ACCM Dig Vinay Singh on February 6.
“When Baig was arrested in 1999, the Wildlife (Protection) Act mandated a punishment of one to six years imprisonment as against three to seven years currently for illegal trade in articles of Schedule I species. He was awarded a minimal sentence of one year because of his health conditions,” said Saurabh Sharma, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) lawyer who had assisted the prosecution.
Following the sentencing, Baig had prayed to the court to recall the order, but the court declined as review of judgment is not permissible. He also appealed to be released on probation for good conduct. However, this too was denied by the court.
“In the backdrop of Chinese accusations that India is not doing enough to protect the Tibetan antelope (which is killed to extract shahtoosh wool), this case exemplifies otherwise. Additionally, there has been a large number of seizures and arrests, and the cases are being heard in Indian courts. In Delhi alone, there must be more than 20 shahtoosh related cases, which are moving ahead slowly but steadily,” said Ashok Kumar, Vice-chairman, WTI.
