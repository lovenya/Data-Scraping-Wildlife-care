Nagaon (Assam), October 29, 2010: The Assam Forest Department has initiated a probe into the recent death of a sub-adult elephant in Nagaon district of the state.
Dr Anil Deka, veterinarian at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) – Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), who was called in to treat the elephant, recalled, “I was informed by authorities at Nagaon Wildlife Division late Friday night. Leaving CWRC around 5:00 am the next day, I reached Nagaon four hours later with my team including two animal keepers.”
On reaching the site, the team witnessed the presence of a huge crowd surrounding the elephant as it struggled out of a swamp.
The elephant, about four years old, was severely injured with a seven and a half inch spear wound on its body. Believed to have been left behind by its herd, it succumbed to injuries on Saturday.
Post-mortem was carried out by Dr Dijen Sharma, veterinarian with the Government of Assam.  Septicaemia was suspected to be the cause of death.
Reiterating the same, Suresh Chand, Chief Wildlife Warden, Assam said “The post mortem revealed that the animal died of a highly septic and maggot infested wound that was several weeks old. The Assam government has constituted a one-man committee whose report is expected in a short time.”
Mr Chand rubbished claims of the elephant being tortured by villagers and said that the crowd was only trying to save the animal which had strayed into a swamp.
