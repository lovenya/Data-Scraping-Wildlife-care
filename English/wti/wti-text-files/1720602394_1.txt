New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today made a major seizure of nine shahtoosh shawls from a residence in South Delhiâ€™s posh Greater Kailash-I area, according to official sources here.The sources said that the high quality shahtoosh shawls, some of which were exquisitely embroidered, were seized from one Nisar Khan, owner of Cute Carpets Emporium. The raid was conducted by a Special Investigation Unit of the CBI.
Wildlife observers said the seizure proves that shahtoosh shawls are still being sold clandestinely especially in New Delhi and other parts of North India despite being banned.
Shahtoosh shawls are made from the wool of the Tibetan antelope, an endangered species according the highest protection in the country by the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Even the government of state of Jammu and Kashmir, the only production centre of the shawl, has amended its laws and accorded full protection to the Tibetan antelope.
