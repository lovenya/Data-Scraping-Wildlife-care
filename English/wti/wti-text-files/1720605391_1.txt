Deopani, Kaziranga National Park, 19 April 2020: A month old male rhino calf, separated from its mother was rescued by Wildlife Trust of India’s veterinary team from the Center for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) near Kaziranga.
The forest staff of west Bandardubi forest camp (Kaziranga National Park) were the first to spot the solitary calf near the National Highway 715.  Pankaj Borah the ACF cum Range Officer of Bagori Forest Range with his team commenced a search operation to find the mother rhino in the vicinity.  After an unsuccessful search, which could have reunited the displaced calf with her, WTI’s team at the wildlife rescue centre CWRC was called in by the forest department.

The calf was brought to the rescue centre without any delay. It was found to be slightly dehydrated and oral hydration was given by our trained wildlife vets.
“It seems to be separated from the mother since a considerable time. It has been kept under observation at our large animal care facility at CWRC under quarantine as per our protocols” explained Dr. Panjit Basumatary, wildlife veterinarian who led the rescue operation along with the Kaziranga forest staff team.

Meanwhile, the forest staff continue to search for the mother rhino with hopes of a reunion, failing which, the calf will undergo rehabilitation until it is fit to be released back to the wild.
