Yarmouth Port (US): Rescuers from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW – www.ifaw.org) have mobilised to Taiwan to assist in animal rescue efforts following the devastating Typhoon that slammed into the island last week.
IFAW is responding to a cry for help by local groups currently working to save animals affected by the storm. Reports indicate that at least 10 animal shelters were damaged, leaving more than 1,000 dogs trapped by floods and more than 100 dogs drowned or missing.
“We need to move quickly,” said IFAW’s Dick Green, “Our fear is that more dogs will die if the shelters do not quickly receive relief supplies and help rebuild the shelters.”
Typhoon Morakot dumped a record 120 inches (3 meters) of rain on southern Taiwan over the weekend. Entire villages were submerged in water and mud and there are no clear estimates on the number of fatalities. Officials are describing Typhoon Morakot as the worst flooding in half a century.
Incredible human and animal survival stories have been reported. Local villager Huan Chin-bao interviewed this week by newswire AFP talked about witnessing a mountain crumbling in seconds burying half of his neighborhood. Huang said he and another 40 people were guided by his two dogs to higher ground. “The dogs are our saviors,” he said.
IFAW expects to find animal shelters need medical supplies, drinking water, dog food, and assistance rebuilding the dogs’ homes.
