Pakke Tiger Reserve (Arunachal Pradesh): IFAW-WTI’s Asiatic black bear rehabilitation programme in north-east India recorded yet another success as a hand-raised two-year-old, one of the five released in June 2011, was found ‘at home’ in the wild. The sub-adult was tracked in the Khari area of Pakke TR in Arunachal Pradesh, and its radio-collar removed.


IFAW-WTI in collaboration with the Forest Departments of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam has rehabilitated 26 orphaned Asiatic black bear cubs.
“This animal was brought to the Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation in April 2010 from Donchimagre, Meghalya at the age of 5 months,” says Dr NVK Ashraf, Chief Veterinarian, WTI. “It was shifted to Khari for acclimatisation as part of a soft release programme. The team has been monitoring it since its release.”
The team first located the bear on February 5 tracking the signal from his radio-collar. They were aiming to tranquilise the animal, examine it and remove the collar if all was fine. The bear was however, moving on the edge of a high, steep hill and tranquilising was not feasible keeping the safety of the animal in mind. They returned the next morning to find the situation better and went ahead with the operation. The animal was cornered, facilitating the darting distance and tranquilised.
Dr Jahan Ahmed, IFAW-WTI veterinarian, who was leading the team said, “There were no external wounds, the mucus membrane was pink, the coat was lustrous, skin was soft and pliable and the body weight was normal.”
The animal was seen returning to its den after revival. This is a good sign and normal behaviour says Dr Sathyakumar, WII. “Black bears use caves and other natural crevices for resting.  They may also use very dense undergrowth or thickets in undisturbed densely forested habitats for resting.”
