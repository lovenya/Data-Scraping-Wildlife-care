Bhubaneshwar, 18th July, 2023: Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) initiates Gaj Utsav in Odisha with a planning meeting organized with stakeholders from the forest department, representatives of judiciary, local NGOs and public representatives at Bhubaneshwar, Odisha.
Since its inception in 2018, the highly acclaimed ‘Gaj Utsav’, a flagship campaign on elephants by Wildlife Trust of India, has been making waves across elephant range states. The campaign kick-started with a remarkable four-day event, ‘Gaj Mahotsav,’ held in Delhi in 2018, and quickly became India’s largest celebration dedicated to elephants, garnering immense support and enthusiasm.
In 2022, the campaign reached new heights with ‘Gajotsavam’ in Kerala, a multidisciplinary tribute to India’s National Heritage Animal amidst the enchanting realm of “God’s own country.” Throughout the year, diverse events held in key cities of Kerala facilitated impactful collaborations among policymakers, industrialists, distinguished wildlife conservationists, social media influencers, and prominent personalities from the entertainment and arts industry, school children, and members of civil society. Together, they forged a unified mandate for the preservation of Kerala’s wild elephant populations, engaging approximately 50,000 individuals.
