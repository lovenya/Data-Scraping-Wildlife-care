Pobitara: On February 6, 2001 a sub-adult female Barking Deer, that had been confiscated from the Nagaon area and handed over to the Pobitara Wildlife Sanctuary Range Officer Mr Mrigen Barua, was badly bitten and injured by street dogs at the Range Office itself.
With bite marks at 13 places on the thighs, with one perforating wound, the animal was bleeding profusely. WTI’s vet on the spot, Dr Bhaskar Chaudhary, immediately treated the deer’s wounds with the help of Forest Department staff.
The treatment is continuing and the animal is responding well.
