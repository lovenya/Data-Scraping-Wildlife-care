Veraval, Gujarat: Fishermen have released another whale shark from their nets – this time off the coast of Veraval, where about 30 people took their turn in a rescue operation which lasted for more than three hours.
When Laljibhai Dhanjibhai saw the fish entangled in his net, he quickly informed the officials to arrange for its rescue.
On February 28, a team comprising forest and fisheries officials and fishermen reached the spot – 50 nautical miles off the coast of Veraval and released the fish.
This is the second incident within a fortnight, where fishermen in Sutrapada released another whale shark.
“40 nets were cut to release the fish.” Forest Officer P. S. Babaria, said
“Without the strong support from the fishermen community, these rescues wouldn’t have been possible.” He said.
About 80 to 100 nets are used by each fisherman every time they come out to harvest. Dozens of nets are required to cut to release the fish, which is a major welfare issue.
Last year the Gujarat government announced compensation for fishermen to mitigate the losses.
To save the whale shark, Wildlife Trust of India had launched a campaign in Gujarat in the year 2004 in partnership between International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Tata Chemicals Ltd., Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd., and the Gujarat Forest Department.
Shri Morari Bapu also joined the campaign.
