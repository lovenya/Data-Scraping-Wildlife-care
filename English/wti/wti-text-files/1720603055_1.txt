New Delhi: Six deserving forest guards at the Keibul Lamjao National Park received field kits from the Addl. Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Addl. PCCF) and the Deputy Conservator of Forest (Parks and Sanctuaries) on June 23.
Each kit containing a rucksack, rain coat, jacket, water bottle, ground sheet, sleeping bag, and a torch was provided to the forest guards as incentives for their dedication at work.
The award ceremony was organized at the Inspection Bungalow (Range Office) of the Park, and was attended by a number of senior forest officials and the field staff.
Kharshing (Addl. PCCF) said, “This support by WTI has been very encouraging and would help the staff working in difficult conditions.”
Dr. Sandeep Tiwari, Asst. Manager WTI said, “This incentive would be a morale booster for others at the Park and elsewhere.
Early this year, Salam Rajesh member of the State Board for Wildlife had placed a proposal in consultation with the forest department to Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) for the supply of field kits. The proposal was sanctioned by WTI under its Rapid Action Project.
The park is home to the famous Sanghai deer (Manipur Brow-antlered deer) which is endemic to this area. A major portion of the Park floats on the famous Loktak Lake, popular for its different migratory birds and water fowls.
The Rapid Action Project was initiated by WTI to address wildlife emergencies across the country by helping the forest staff and other organizations and individuals working for conservation.
