Karbi Anglong, November 16, 2010: Rescue of a rare clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) stranded in the house of a forest official in East Karbi Anglong has reaffirmed presence of the species in the Karbi Anglong Autonomous District in Assam.


The clouded leopard, a sub-adult male, was tranquilised and released by Forest Department officials assisted by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) veterinarians of Mobile Veterinary Services (MVS) Karbi Anglong supported by the Japan Tiger Elephant Fund (JTEF).
The animal was found underneath the bed of Pranab Terang, Range Officer, NE Range, Silonijan, Karbi Anglong East Division, on Friday. “I woke up to the sound of dogs barking near my house, and then heard some sound under my bed. I found the cat there, alerted WTI and waited for the rescue team,” said Terang.
The Range Officer informed WTI veterinarian Dr Anthony Phangso, MVS Karbi Anglong. Dr Phangso along with other WTI veterinarians Dr Anil Deka and Dr Arindam Pasoni sedated the animal using a blow pipe, and helped the Forest officials to relocate the animal to the adjoining Nambor Reserve Forest, where it was released.
“Being habitat specialists, clouded leopards are rarely seen in human settlements, let alone in a house! However, due to disturbances in habitat, wild animals are often encountered in human-dominated areas; our team has, in the past, helped rescue a leopard and even a tiger from within houses. This clouded leopard must also have accidentally entered into the settlement,” said Dr Rathin Barman, Coordinator, WTI.
“Clouded leopard is an extremely shy, nocturnal tree-dwelling cat species found in northeast India. There are reports of clouded leopards from Karbi Anglong but sightings are rare; this incident provides further evidence to the presence of this species from this area,” Dr Barman added.
