New Delhi : After tightening the snare on Sansar Chand, a complex legal situation arose yesterday after the Rajasthan Police applied for his custody and transit to Jaipur. The Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) expressed his inability to grant the request because Sansar Chand case had been transfered to organised crime court (MCOCA court) which had not yet become operational in Delhi . The situation became even more complicated since Central Bureau of Investigation did not want the custody of Sansar Chand any more and therefore the ACMM sent him to judicial custody which meant that he was incarcerated in Tihar jail of Delhi .
Today the Rajasthan police obtained orders from the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) authorizing the ACMM to hear the case after which the Rajasthan Police granted custody and transit of the wildlife smuggler.
Sansar Chand faces interrogation in Jaipur in a case of seizure of leopard skins. His wife Rani and son Akash are already in custody in Jaipur in the same case and were denied bail once again today by the Rajasthan High Court.
Sansar Chand is also accused in a case in Ajmer , where he was awarded a sentence of five years. After filing an appeal, he became entitled to bail and then went underground. What followed was a carefully planned sting operation on the part of the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police and conducted across several states that has finally trapped this don of wildlife crime who lives with the blood of hundreds of animals on his conscience.
