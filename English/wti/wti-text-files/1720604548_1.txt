Jorhat, Assam, July 24, 2017: Working in concert with the Assam Forest Department, a Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) team from IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) recently resolved a conflict situation by tranquilising a leopard that had strayed into a village in Assam’s Jorhat district. The leopard, a sub-adult female, was later released into the wild.
In the early morning of Friday, July 21, Atul Bora opened the garage beside his home in Pulibor village. He saw the leopard and beat a hasty retreat, having the presence of mind to close the bamboo door behind him. He then informed the local forest authorities.
The leopard had no physical injuries and displayed a natural, instinctive aggression. The CWRC team determined that it would be fit for wild release the next day.
The Assam Forest Department’s Jorhat Forest Division placed an emergency call to CWRC, whereupon an MVS team comprising veterinarian Dr Samshul Ali and two animal keepers rushed to the spot. The team first surveyed the area around the garage and house to determine the potential for harm to either humans or the animal. Having assessed the situation, Dr Ali successfully darted the animal through the small opening from which it was visible.
The MVS team then transported the leopard to CWRC for overnight observation. “The leopard had no physical injuries”, said Dr Ali, “and displayed a natural, instinctive aggression. We determined that it would be fit for wild release the next day.”
The MVS team released the animal into the Nambor Reserve Forest, Golaghat district on Saturday, July 22, in the presence of forest department officials.
