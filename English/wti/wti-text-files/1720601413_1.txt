Kaziranga (Assam): Over 3000 Indian bull-frog (Rana tigrina) packed in 14 gunny sacks were found lying next to the National Highway 37 in near Kaziranga by a police patrolling team Wednesday, official sources said.
A team comprising forest officials and a Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) veterinarian rushed to the spot near Methoni Tea Estate and found that a large number of frogs had suffocated and died in the bags.
“Bull frogs are a delicacy in many parts of north eastern India, especially in Nagaland, where these were probably being taken,” Dr. Anjan Talukdar of WTI said.
The bags were suspected to be thrown from a truck which was on its way to Nagaland as it surprised by a police check post on the highway near Bokakhat.
The frogs which were alive were later released in a paddy field near the Panbari range of the Kaziranga National Park.
