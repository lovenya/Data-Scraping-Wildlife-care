Johannesburg, South Africa, September 27, 2016: Conservationists were jubilant last evening as CITES voted once and for all to abandon the controversial Decision Making Mechanism (DMM) for a process to trade in ivory.
While the decision became a nail-biter in the final moments, those wanting to end any continued consideration for ongoing debate about possible future ivory trade were rewarded with a satisfying finish. The recommendation by Namibia, South Africa and Botswana to urge CITES Parties to adopt a DMM was roundly rejected by a two-thirds majority, led by outspoken opponents Kenya, Republic of Congo and Chad.
Reacting to this development, Wildlife Trust of India’s CEO & Executive Director Vivek Menon said: “The DMM would have provided a potential scientific cover for the ivory trade, which has been under a nine-year moratorium. Its defeat is a relatively large victory for elephants.”

“This is fantastic news, and just the outcome we were hoping for,” said Jason Bell, Elephant Programme Director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). “There were a few confused moments there and even some unusual voting decisions, but in the end common sense prevailed and the future of elephants will be all the better for it. We are delighted”.
