Kolkata: The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) has confirmed that the skin seized from the premises of a Sreeleather showroom in Kolkata in May this year belongs to a blackbuck – a Schedule I species.
The skin was confiscated in a joint operation by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and local police, assisted by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) on May 11.
“The ZSI has confirmed it to be a blackbuck skin. The skin was apparently gifted, and was on display in the showroom when it was seized. Further investigation is going on,” said RK Samal, Regional Deputy Director, WCCB (Eastern Region).
“The skin was old, and although we suspected it to be a blackbuck skin, it had to be verified. So, it was sent to ZSI,” explained Dinesh Pandey, Project Officer, WTI, who assisted the authorities.
Blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) enjoys the highest level of protection in India, being listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
Poaching and trade of a schedule I species can draw a punisment of 3-7 years imprisonment along with a fine.
“Possessing protected wildlife articles such as this blackbuck skin without a valid ownership certificate provided by the Chief Wildlife Warden is an offence. Whether the person possessing these articles poached the animal or purchased the skin illegally, he will be prosecuted under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, if he doesn’t have relevant documents,” said Saurabh Sharma, wildlife lawyer.
