Civet kittens being fed milk at CWRC

Kaziranga, August 28, 2015: Four common palm civets being hand raised at IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) are ready for the in-situ acclimatisation.
At present, the civets are housed in an outdoor enclosure and are being fed milk, fruits and an occasional egg. The civets were admitted to CWRC on May 11, 2015, when they had not yet opened their eyes. All the scientific protocols on hand raising omnivores are being followed and these animals are being closely monitored at CWRC.
These civet kittens were found alone by the forest officials at Majuli Island in upper Assam. Reportedly, the mother was chased away by the villagers and she never returned to the nesting burrow. The situation demanded that the kittens be rescued to ensure their safety and well-being. The kittens were not looking in good health when rescued and needed immediate treatment.
The forest authorities of Jorhat district then contacted CWRC and shifted the kittens to the wildlife care facility at Panbari RF. Now, the kittens are four and half month old and gradually learning the skills to survive in the wild.

“It was a nice feeling seeing them grow under our care. Now, it is time for them to be introduced to wild and we are doing that gradually. They are already placed in an outdoor enclosure. Next they will be taken to the release site along with the enclosure for in situ acclimatisation,” informed Dr. Panjit Basumatary, IFAW-WTI veterinarian.
