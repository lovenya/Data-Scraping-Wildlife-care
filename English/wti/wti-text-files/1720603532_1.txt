Junagadh (Gujarat): Twenty persons were convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment by a Gujarat court today, for poaching endangered Asiatic lions in Gir National Park in March last year.
The Court of PK Makwana, I class magistrate, Junagadh, announced the sentence which also included a fine of Rs 10,000 each.
JM Sakanpara, public prosecutor, said, “The accused were arrested for poaching six Asiatic lions from Gir and illegal possession of wildlife articles. Two lion claws were recovered from the main accused Kuntar Singh and Nanaka Singh during their arrest in April last year. The hunting was reportedly carried out on March 3 and March 29 last year. They had disclosed trade in body parts as the motive for hunting.”
Keshav Kumar, IGP, who led the investigations, said, “This is the first known case in India in which the lions were hunted for trade.”
The remaining accused were subsequently arrested based on the information provided by Kuntar and Nanaka. The accused remained in judicial custody throughout the trial, following denial of their bail plea by the High Court.
Saurabh Sharma, advocate of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) who provided legal assistance to the prosecution said, “This is a first of a kind case in which so many people have been convicted at a time in a wildlife case. Even the duration of the trial was relatively expeditious for a wildlife case. Within 18 months of the crime, the accused have been brought to justice.”
Ashok Kumar, Vice-chairman, said, “This is a historic moment for all wildlife conservationists. We congratulate the authorities on their achievement.”
Gir Forest is the only area where the ‘critically endangered’ Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) are still found. A survey conducted in 2005 had estimated the presence of 359 lions. They are threatened by poaching for bones, used in Traditional Chinese Medicines, and claws, used as amulets. Death from electrocution and from being trapped in open wells is also common.
