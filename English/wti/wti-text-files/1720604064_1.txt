Kaziranga National Park: An Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) cub admitted to the IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) by the Assam Forest Department officials after it was found in a village near Kaziranga National Park, was returned to the wild on Saturday.

The bear had ‘strayed’ into Dagaon on Friday morning. Estimated to be around eight-months-old, the male sub-adult bear was alone and no evidence of its mother was found from nearby forests.“Although weaning takes place at about five months of age, bear cubs normally spend about two years with their mother. This cub must have been separated from its mother to be wandering into human settlements, perhaps for food,” said Dr Rathin Barman, Coordinator, WTI.Fearing conflict with people, it was captured and brought to CWRC.
“The bear was spotted in the village by locals who informed the Forest Department of its presence. Since we didn’t see its mother around we had to capture it and shift it to CWRC,” said Atiqur Rehman, Range Officer, Kohora, who was present during the rescue.
“We kept the bear under observation for a day. It was quite healthy and rather aggressive. We micro-chipped it and released it within the park limits,” said Dr Abhijit Bhawal, CWRC veterinarian.

Listed under Schedule II of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act and classified ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN Red List of threatened species, the Asiatic black bear faces threats from poaching and habitat destruction. WTI has handled 19 cases involving displaced bears in Assam, most of which were between the age of one and 12 months.
