New Delhi: Hearing a Special Leave Petition filed by the State of West Bengal against the grant of bail to the alleged wildlife trader Ratiram Sharma, the Supreme Court today issued notice to the respondent.  
The accused was granted bail by the Kolkota High Court on September 7, after his five bail applications were rejected earlier by the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate of Alipurduar.
Sharma was arrested from his residence on July 14, by the Forest Department for illegal wildlife trade under sections 49B and 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.
4 leopard skins, 140 pieces of rhino skins, and 125 pieces of tiger bones and a skull were recovered from him.
“In a previous case of Rhino horn in Assam, a production warrant was issued against him by a court,” Saurabh Sharma, who is assisting the State Counsel in the Supreme Court and an Advocate of Wildlife Trust of India, said.
In the petition, State contended that the accused was not entitled for bail in view of his confessional statement made during investigation and large quantity of animal parts seized from him, specified under Part I of Schedule I of the Act. Besides, this offence was committed while he was still on bail for a similar offence pending against him.
WTI has been assisting the Forest Department by providing legal assistance in these court cases.
