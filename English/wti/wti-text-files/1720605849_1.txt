The Indianapolis Zoo is announcing an international grant created to save an animal species from extinction. The Indianapolis Zoo Saving Species Challenge will award $1 million to one organization anywhere in the world that can develop and implement a plan that will lead to the improvement of an animal species’ status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List.


We know that reversing the decline of a species takes time. If we trust the science and stay focused, we can save a species. The Indianapolis Zoo Saving Species Challenge can serve as a model of how discipline, dedication and focused resources can change the trajectory of extinction.
