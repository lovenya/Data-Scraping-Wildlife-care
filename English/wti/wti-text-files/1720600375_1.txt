Jadegindam, July 15, 2015: The Wildlife Trust of India (WTI)-World Land Trust (WLT) initiative of providing teaching aid to school children started in 2013 as part of conservation support to Jadegindam â€” a key village on the Rewak-Emangre Corridor. The purpose of the same was to motivate children in attending to their educational needs and also to sensitize the future generation on elephant corridor protection and overall wildlife conservation. Over the last two years, children from the Jade Gindam Primary School have been provided with aid in form of school bags, umbrellas, books, etc.
This year too, in the month of July 2015, 40 school children from the Jade Gindam Govt. Lower Primary School were provided with teaching aid in the form of schoolbags, books, etc. Children and parents were happy about the initiative and expressed their thankfulness. With support from WTI-WLT in last few years, the attendance in school has improved and hopefully this will culminate into better education to the children of the village. The Nokma of the village Smt. Hiramoni Marak also expressed her happiness and gratitude towards this initiative.
Jadegindam is a key village on the Rewak Emangre Elephant Corridor which was declared as a VRF due to the conservation initiatives by WTI and WLT in the region. This has been a very innovative approach for conservation where community has owned the conservation efforts, and more importantly where both the community and Government have come forward for securing the safe passage for wildlife movement.
