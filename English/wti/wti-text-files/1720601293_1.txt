Ludhiana: Punjab has a tradition of wearing shahtoosh shawls. This shawl has been traditionally handed down as a family heirloom through generations especially in wealthy families.
This winter the Wildlife Trust of India decided to take its `Say No to Shahtoosh” campaign to Punjab, to create awareness among the Punjabi women and make them join the anti-shahtoosh campaign.
The first in the series of meetings was at Ludhiana, the industrial hub of Punjab. This city is also home a number of wool manufacturing industries. Lakshmi Ladies Club, Ludhiana, invited WTI to present its Tibetan Antelope Project and its efforts to put an end to the shahtoosh trade. In Punjab, the shawl is worn largely by ladies and is seen as a status symbol by the upper class.
About 400 members attended the presentation at the club. Interaction with these ladies revealed that though most of them knew that the shawl is illegal and not to be worn, but they did not know the reasons for the ban. The presentation cleared the doubts in their minds and many members pledged their support for the cause, saying they would never wear a shahtoosh again.
Two of Ludhiana’s upmarket garment outlets, Neelam’s and Nilibar, will now attach anti- shahtoosh tags to their garments. Posters urging people to support the cause and stop wearing shahtoosh are also being put up at some jewellery outlets in the city.
The wool trade association too has pledged support for this cause and will publish an article in its newsletter, which is mailed to its members including manufacturers, distributors and dealers of wool.
