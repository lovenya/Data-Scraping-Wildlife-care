Mr. Pradeep Kumar, IFS, DFO stated that WTI in collaboration with the Forest Department, has been actively involved in various programs dedicated to the conservation of whale sharks. These efforts have yielded significant positive outcomes, particularly in the coastal regions of Kerala. In the period of 2019-20, there were numerous reports of crimes related to whale sharks, turtles, dolphins, and other marine species in this area, but these incidents have considerably decreased.
Sajan John from WTI further emphasised our mission to encourage community engagement and environmental conservation activities. The goal is to raise awareness and advocate for the protection of these magnificent creatures.
The “Save the Whale Shark Campaign” has an overarching objective of fostering conservation awareness about these remarkable creatures among marine fishermen, local communities, and students. Since 2018, this initiative in Kerala has yielded impressive results, with fishermen successfully liberating 7 Whale Sharks ensnared in the nets along the coast.
