Rescued vulture released into the wild

Kaziranga, December 28, 2015: Two Himalayan griffon vultures being treated at IFAW-WTI run CWRC were released in the wilderness of Kaziranga National Park by the MVS team on December 28, 2015. The team led by IFAW-WTI veterinarian, Dr Biswajit Boruah, tagged the vultures with bird rings before they were set free.
On December 17, 2015, Green Guard Nature, a local conservation NGO, and Assam Forest Department rescued one of the vultures from Ghelalata (Lungsung) area of Nagaon district in Assam.
Meanwhile, the other griffon was admitted at CWRC due to physical debility from Barhat area of Sivsagar district in Assam on December 3, 2015.
According to Dr Biswajit Boruah, “The vultures regained health after being treated at the CWRC enclosure. Their food intake and flying capabilities had improved drastically post treatment and after a thorough assessment, it was decided that the time is right to release them back into the wild. They were released at Agoratoli Forest Range of Kaziranga National Park, where vulture population exists.”
A few Himalayan griffons were seen hovering around the site where these birds were released. Since 2002, IFAW-WTI has released 104 vultures back into the wild.
