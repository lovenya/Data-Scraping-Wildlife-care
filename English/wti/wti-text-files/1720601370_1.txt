The District Forest Officer (DFO) at Haridwar in Uttaranchal State, is facing an acute shortage of funds in the wake of the formation of the new State, and needs financial support to maintain the effectiveness of anti-poaching and patrolling operations. WTI will part-finance the fuel and other running costs of an anti-poaching patrol vehicle in the southern parts of the Rajaji National Park. The DFO, who has been effectively enforcing wildlife protection laws, recently caught a poacher in the area and imposed a heavy penalty on him.
