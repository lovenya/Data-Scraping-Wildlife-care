Meerut (Uttar Pradesh): A captive elephant in musth that went berserk in Partapur bypass, Meerut, was today tranquilised and restrained by a team including Uttar Pradesh Forest Department officials, assisted by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
The elephant had been hired for a marriage function in Meerut yesterday. It turned violent during the function, after which the mahout fled. A number of vehicles were damaged by the elephant. There were, however, no casualties.
The elephant was tranquilised this afternoon by Dr NVK Ashraf, Director, Wild Rescue programme, WTI. He was apprised about the incident by Dinesh Pandey, Assistant Field Officer, WTI, who coordinated the operation with the Forest Department officials. Pandey was informed about the elephant by Irfan Rasul Wani, Divisional Forest Officer, Noida.
“The elephant is about 40-50 years old. It is not micro-chipped as captive elephants are supposed to be according to the law,” said Dr Ashraf. “The owner has not been able to show us the ownership documents required to keep the elephant in captivity. So, it will be confiscated,” added Lalit Verma, DFO, Meerut.
Both the mahout and the owner have been apprehended by the authorities. The elephant, on the other hand, has been restrained in a nearby farmhouse and is being monitored by the Forest Department officials.
The Uttar Pradesh Forest Department and WTI had entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU), last year, to manage human-carnivore conflicts in the state. The MoU, also includes collaboration on other veterinary interventions as and when required.
