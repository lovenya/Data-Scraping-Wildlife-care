The Future For Nature (FFN) awards are back. Each year the FFN Foundation recognises three young, driven nature conservationists from around the world. FFN looks forward in supporting young, talented, and ambitious nature conservationists who are committed to protecting the species of nature.
Nature conservationists from all over the world between 18-35 years can apply. FFN Award winners not only receive €50,000 prize, they also gain international recognition for their work, and will be able to connect with like-minded people through the FFN Family.
