Yarmouth Port, Mass: After suffering the worst flood in its modern history, Jakarta is now busy trying to recover from the devastation.
The floods began in early February and, at one point, covered 80% of Indonesia’s capital.  Thousands of people fled the rising waters and many animals were left to fend for themselves.
In response to this disaster, IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) and CARE (Center for Animal Rescue and Education) have mobilized a team to rescue domestic animals that were left homeless and abandoned and to provide basic veterinary care for the animals that survived the floods.
IFAW and CARE have been going out daily to feed and attend to a large number of roaming, stray animals. Indonesia’s large cat population has been left undernourished, dehydrated, and many suffer from intestinal parasites.
“The area impacted is so enormous that a significant part of each day has been spent traveling between relief sites in order to reach as many animals in need as possible,” said IFAW ER responder, Jennifer Miller.
“The primary objective is to provide support to the animals until the community can get back on its feet,” said IFAW Emergency Relief Manager, Dick Green. “Many of these animals need immediate care.”
As the team continued with relief efforts in Jakarta, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook the island of Sumatra in Western Indonesia causing severe damage. IFAW and CARE team members are assessing the current situation and preparing to mobilize assistance to affected areas.
