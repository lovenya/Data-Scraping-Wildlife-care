We are thrilled to announce a momentous milestone in the journey of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). On the 16th of November 2023, we marked 25 years of dedicated service to wildlife conservation in India. This significant occasion was celebrated with great fervour across all our field stations, bringing together the vibrant tapestry of local communities and dedicated forest department officials. As we reflect on the past quarter-century, we are proud to showcase the impact of our collective efforts through a compilation of photographs from various projects undertaken by WTI. These images vividly capture the spirit of our mission and the invaluable support received from communities and government partners.

From the snow-clad landscapes of the Himalayas to the sun-kissed shores of our coastal regions, the photographs tell a story of resilience, coexistence, and the shared responsibility we bear for the diverse wildlife inhabiting our beautiful country.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all those who have been a part of this incredible journey—our team members, local communities, government agencies, and every individual who has contributed to our cause. Together, we have made a positive impact on the conservation landscape of India, fostering harmony between humans and wildlife.
WTI also collaborated with the Global Wildlife Fair to screen two documentaries showcasing our projects at the India Habitat Centre (IHC) in New Delhi. More than 80 people joined for the screening of “Markhor – Hope in a Paradise” by Shivang Mehta and and “Vanishing Croaks of Delhi-NCR, a film by Harshit Chawla. We thank IHC for giving us the platform to showcase our conservation efforts.

As we step into the future, WTI remains committed to its mission of protecting and preserving our natural heritage. The challenges ahead are significant, but with the continued support of passionate individuals and organisations, we are confident that the next 25 years will see even greater strides in wildlife conservation.
Thank you for being a part of the Wildlife Trust of India’s journey. Your support is the driving force behind our success, and we look forward to many more years of collaborative conservation efforts.
