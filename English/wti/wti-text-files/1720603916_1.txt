Guwahati (Assam): The Government of Assam has passed a notification to equip state Forest Department personnel with fire arms to ensure better protection to its forests and wildlife, particularly rhinos.
The order released by the Governor’s office, last month, indicates that the decision was taken to tackle mounting threats to forests and wildlife in protected areas and reserved forests. Its provisions apply to all forest officers from frontline staff to the seniormost members of the Department.
Forest authorities have often argued that under-equipped frontline staff are at a disadvantage when fighting against organised poaching gangs.
“We have been waiting for this order for a long time. When we approached the state Chief Minister Shri Tarun Gogoi and the state Forest Minister Shri Rockybul Hussain, they were very supportive and agreed on the need for this order, to help protect our wildlife,” said VK Bisnoi, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (General) and Head of Forest Force, Government of Assam.
The order also provides immunity to forest officials from prosecution without prior sanction, in case of firing incidents. However, suspect firing incidents will be investigated upon through a Majesterial Enquiry, and criminal proceedings can be initiated against erring officials if the use of fire arms is proven as “unnecessary, unwarranted and excessive”.
