Pobitora (Assam):Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, which has the highest concentration of highly endangered Greater one horned rhinocerous, has been completely submerged by the current flood in the north-east Indian Assam state. The sanctuary has at least 70 rhinos in just over 20 sq kilometres of land.
As the rising waters of the Brahmaputra and Kopili rivers entered the sanctuary, two crucial dykes designed to regulate the rise gave way and the animals are huddled on artificial mounds built to provide refuge.
“Almost 100 per cent of the sanctuary is under water, except the hillocks, where the animals are taking shelter. Food and other relief materials are being supplied to them.” Range Officer Mukul Tamuli, said.
To make patrolling for staff easier, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) has rushed in lifejackets for staff fighting strong currents looking for poachers taking advantage of this opportunity.
“We already sent the items as part of WTI’s Rapid Action Project (RAP),” said Jose Louis Sr. Programme Officer of WTI who is managing the project. “Currently, we are monitoring the situation, if need arises we will be able to provide more.”
Out of the 22 anti-poaching camps, two camps have been washed away, four were destroyed and seven staff dwellings are under water. All fair weather roads in the sanctuary have been damaged.
“Nine wild boars, a wild buffaloe and a hare died in flood, while two rhinoceros calves separated from their mothers were reunited. For safety reasons, we are not allowing the rhinos to move out of the protected area,” Tamuli said.
“We require at least 08 more boats for patrolling and rescue operations. We have 20 at the moment.”
“Since electricity has been cut off, we haven’t been able to charge our wireless handsets, which is causing a huge problem in coordinating between the camps,” he added.
