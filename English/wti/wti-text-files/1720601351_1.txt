Guwahati: A sub-adult male Slow Loris was bought from the local market of Haflong in the North Cachar Hills of Assam, from a trader and brought to Dr Bhaskar Chaudhary, WTI’s Guwahati-based veterinarian, on January 15, 2001. It was in perfect health when brought to him. Dr Chaudhary, with the active support of Dr Parimal Roy Choudhury of the Department of Microbiology at Guwahati’s College of Veterinary Sciences, reared it in captivity for 15 days and closely monitored its general health and progress.
After some primary examinations were conducted, the animal was prepared for release in the Buda Mayang Foothills in the Pobitara Wildlife Sanctuary, after discussions with Mr Mrigen Barua, Range Officer at Pobitara. On February 7, the Slow Loris was successfully released into the forest and its behaviour closely monitored for a full week by the Range Officer and forest guards.
