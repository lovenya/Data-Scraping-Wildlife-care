Sundarbans, 22nd January, 2024: In a significant step towards conservation and community awareness & engagement, the West Bengal Forest Department and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) inaugurated two Sundarban Education Centres (SECs) in Madhya-Purba Gurguria Adarsha Vidyapith and Ambikanagar Haripriya High School of Kultali, South 24 Pargana(s) District of West Bengal, marking a pivotal moment of WTI’s commitment to environmental education and wildlife protection.
The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a unique ecosystem that spans across India and Bangladesh, renowned for its rich biodiversity and mangrove forests. Recognizing the importance of education in fostering environmental consciousness, WTI has taken a commendable initiative by establishing the Sundarban Education Centre.
This newly inaugurated facility aims to serve as a hub for educational programs, workshops, and awareness campaigns that focus on the delicate balance between human activities and the preservation of the Sundarbans’ diverse ecosystem. The centre is equipped with various facilities like booklets on Sundarbans wild flora fauna, display boards to provide a holistic learning experience for students, researchers, and local communities about the wildlife of mangrove.

One of the primary objectives of these Sundarban Education Centres are to empower local communities with knowledge about sustainable living practices and the importance of preserving their natural surroundings. By fostering a sense of responsibility and understanding, WTI hopes to create a community that actively participates in the conservation efforts of the Sundarbans.
The inauguration ceremony witnessed the presence of key stakeholders, including West Bengal Forest Department, Kultali Block officials, local Gram Panchayat members, conservationists, and members of the JFMCs.
The SECs are significant milestones in the ongoing efforts to conserve the Sundarbans by involving local communities. By promoting environmental education and community engagement, WTI has taken a proactive approach to ensure the long-term sustainability of this unique and vital ecosystem. The centres stands as a beacon of hope, inspiring a new generation of environmental stewards committed to the preservation of the Sundarbans for generations to come.
Along with these, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and our partner organization LRRM, has also taken a ground breaking initiative by establishing the Tiger Scouts program. This innovative endeavour is designed to play a pivotal role in instilling a sense of conservation awareness among the local communities in the Sundarbans, focusing specifically on the preservation of the iconic Bengal tiger and its habitat.
The establishment of the Tiger Scouts program comes at a critical time when the Sundarbans face numerous challenges, including habitat degradation, human-wildlife conflict, and climate change impacts. Recognizing the urgency of addressing these issues, this program as part of its broader mission to integrate community participation into wildlife conservation efforts.

The importance of the Tiger Scouts program lies in its ability to engage and empower local youths as ambassadors of conservation. These Tiger Scouts, drawn from the communities residing in and around the Sundarbans, undergo specialized training modules at the Sundarban Education Centre. The training encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the Sundarbans’ ecosystem, the significance of tiger conservation, and effective ways to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. One of the primary objectives of the Tiger Scouts program is to bridge the gap between the local communities and wildlife conservation initiatives. They act as catalysts for change within their communities, disseminating knowledge acquired during their training sessions. Through various outreach activities, awareness campaigns, and interactive sessions, they play a crucial role in educating their peers and elders about the importance of coexisting with wildlife and adopting sustainable practices.
Wildlife Trust of India’s commitment to conservation through community engagement is evident in the establishment of the Tiger Scouts program by nurturing a new generation of environmental stewards, the Sundarban Education Centre aims to create a sustainable model that can be replicated in other regions facing similar conservation challenges.
