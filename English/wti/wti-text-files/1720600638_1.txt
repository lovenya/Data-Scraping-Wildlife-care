CWRC, Kaziranga, April 23: A hog deer with puncture wounds was rescued and brought to IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation (CWRC) by the forest staff of the Kaziranga NP. The CWRC team found the injured animal on the outskirts of the central range of the national park.



According to the Forest Department personnel, the injured animal had strayed out of the park and was found near Sepenakabua village which is close to the central range of the Kaziranga NP. The injuries on the deer were human induced and reportedly some people tried to kill the deer when they saw it in the fringe area of the park. Soon after the deer was found, it was rushed to CWRC by the MVS team that rescued the animal from the spot.



On reaching the centre, the deer was tended to by the CWRC veterinarians under the guidance of Dr. NVK Ashraf, Senior Director & Chief Veterinarian, IFAW-WTI. Dr. Panjit Basumatary, IFAW-WTIâ€™s vet, gave the necessary treatment to the injured animal that is currently under observation. The team is also monitoring the animal very closely to ensure its well-being. Soon after the animal recuperates, attempts would be made to release it back into the wild.
