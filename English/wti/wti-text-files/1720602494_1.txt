NEW DELHI: A major seizure of 20 leopard skins and 19 otter skins were made by the West Bengal police from Matigara police station area on the outskirts of Siliguri yesterday, according to sources.The wildlife articles were seized from three persons who have been arrested. A case has been registered against Tapan Sarkar, Archana Sarkar, and Prahlad Nirala.
According to Mr Ashok Kumar, Senior Advisor and Trustee, Wildlife Trust of India, WTI had gathered information on wildlife articles at Siliguri two months ago but it took some time to develop the case.
Siliguri in West Bengal is a major gateway for smuggling wildlife articles to Nepal from where these goods go to yet unknown destinations. All the major seizures of wildlife articles in last two years had leopard and otter skins and the flow is not ending. New strategies are needed to tackle this menace, Mr Kumar said.
