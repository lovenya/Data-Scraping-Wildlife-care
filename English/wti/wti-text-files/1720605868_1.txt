Valmikinagar, June 17, 2023: Today, on World Crocodile Day, we are thrilled to announce the hatching of 125 gharials in the Gandak River basin. Wildlife Trust of India’s team has been monitoring the nests with local nest watchers and the local forest department officials.

Since 2013-14, the Wildlife Trust of India, in collaboration with the Department of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Govt. of Bihar, has been conserving the critically endangered gharials in the Gandak River. Our efforts paid off, when we discovered gharial breeding in the river in 2016. Today, the Gandak River is home to the second-largest population of these fish-eating reptile in the world!
This year, a remarkable total of 9 gharial nests were detected in the Gandak River, the highest number ever recorded in a single year. Eight nests were found in the West Champaran district of Bihar, and one nest was discovered in the Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh.

“The detection of a gharial nest in Ahiraulidan, under the Tamkuhi range of Kushinagar district, has been a remarkable breakthrough”, said Mr. Anil K Srivastava, Divisional Forest Officer, Kushinagar Forest Division. He has pledged to provide all necessary protection to the nest until hatching. However, detecting nests along the vast expanse of the river remains a challenging task without support of local fishermen and farmers. These nests, nestled within high sand dunes along the river banks, face threats from strong winds, flooding, nest erosion, and damage by predators. Despite these challenges, an impressive 125 gharial babies emerged, offering hope for the future.
Dr. K Nesamani, Field Director-cum-Conservator of Forests at Valmiki Tiger Reserve, proudly declares that gharial recovery in the Gandak River has reached new milestones. “Through active participation from local fishermen and farming communities, we have developed a successful model for monitoring and protecting gharial nests and their crucial habitats.”
Dr. Samir Kumar Sinha, Chief Ecologist of the Wildlife Trust of India, emphasized that the next steps should be to minimize the identified threats and support the increase of the gharial population with the participation of local communities.

In pursuit of this vital conservation initiative, the Wildlife Trust of India has been collaborating with the Los Angeles Zoo, California, and the Department of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Government of Bihar. On the occasion of World Crocodile Day, we invite everyone to join us in celebrating these hatchlings while acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead in the protection of the species. It is through participation that we can ensure the survival and thriving of the critically endangered gharials, preserving their rightful place in the rich biodiversity of the Gandak River.
