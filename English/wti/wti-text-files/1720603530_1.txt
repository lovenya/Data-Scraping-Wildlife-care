Kaziranga National Park (Assam): A displaced wild elephant calf that was reunited with its natal herd in Kaziranga National Park a month ago was sighted earlier last week, confirming successful reintegration. The sighting has pleasantly surprised conservationists who had doubts about its survival, as the calf has a congenital deformity in its leg.  
The calf was rescued by the Assam Forest Department officials from a marsh near Roumari on December 3 last year. It was provided medical treatment for its injuries and reunited with its natal herd soon after.
Dr Phulmoni Gogoi, Wildlife Trust of India – International Fund for Animal Welfare (WTI-IFAW) veterinarian, said, “I had treated the calf for an abscess in its hindlimb. She also had a congenital deformity in the right hind leg stifle joint. She could not flex the leg fully and had a limping gait.  Although, the forest officials had reunited her with her natal herd, we were doubtful of her survival.”
On Tuesday, the calf was sighted by Dr Prasanta Boro, veterinarian at the WTI-IFAW run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC). He was on his way to release a hog deer, when he saw the calf among its herd near Karasine Camp in Kohora Range.
“We hadn’t got any information on the calf after its reunion. I believed that it had been predated upon. But when I saw the pictures taken by Dr Boro, I knew it was her,” Dr Gogoi confirmed, adding that the calf would have to be ‘as lucky’ to reach adulthood.
