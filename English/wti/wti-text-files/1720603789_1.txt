Orang (Assam): A set of equipment to facilitate anti-poaching activities in Assam’s Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park was handed over to the park authorities by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) earlier this month. 
“The equipment provided by WTI is being used by our staff and it is definitely helping them. We are happy at WTI’s prompt response to our request,” said Sushil Kumar Daila, IFS, DFO of Mangaldai Forest Division, which includes Orang.
Torches, first aid kits, solar lanterns and panels were provided to the park administration under WTI’s Rapid Action Project (RAP), following a request by the DFO.  The RAP was supported by samaritans Alka Hingorani, Sriram Srinivasan and Priyamvada Balaji.
“Rapid Action Project provides quick assistance to individuals and grassroots organizations to tackle urgent conservation needs across India. The project prides itself in being able to deliver help, if required, within 24 hours. Lately, Orang had been facing a severe onslaught by poachers. Two rhinos were killed in August and one in October. The park staff have been highly efficient despite the weak infrastructure, and its an honor to us to be able to assist them through these small contributions,” said Radhika Bhagat, Programme Officer, WTI.
Situated on the northern bank of Brahmaputra river, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park is home to about 60 rhinos and 12-15 tigers. There are 33 permanent anti-poaching camps within the national park, each manned by 4-5 staff members.
“Although these camps were already equipped with a torch each, there was a need for a spare, particularly when the team has to break into two groups. On the contrary, first aid kits being made available in these camps is unprecedented. We saw the need as our staff had to travel long distances for any ailments,” said Daila.
“Such contributions, however small or big, by NGOs or governments, go a long way in helping us protect our wildlife,” he added.
