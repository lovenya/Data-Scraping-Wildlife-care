Diphu (Karbi Anglong) Assam: In line with its goal to equip Forest Department staff patrolling protected areas, the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI)’s Van Rakshak Project (VRP), supported by Japan Tiger & Elephant Fund (JTEF), has supplied field kits to frontline members in Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) as part of the commitment to assist the Forest Department’s conservation initiatives.
The equipment distribution event held yesterday was a follow-up to a capacity building training organised in February 2010 by the KAAC Forest Department assisted by WTI-JTEF. Field kits comprising rucksacks, torch lights, raincoats, jackets, sleeping bags, caps and water bottles, were provided to 80 frontline Forest Department staff of Karbi Anglong West Division, who participated in the training.
The event was attended by senior forest officials including Abhijit Rabha, IFS, Conservator of Forests, GN Adhikari, Divisional Forest Officer, Karbi Anglong (West), MK Dhar- DFO, Aforestation, and N Maral, DFO (Silviculture).
Speaking on the occasion, Rabha said, “WTI has always been so willing to help us and has done so in many crucial occasions. Your quick response and willingness to help us is really appreciated.”
“The equipping part of VRP caters to the basic welfare of the frontline staff members during patrolling exercises. That apart, the training in February was also conducted under VRP, which also runs a country-wide unique accident insurance scheme for the frontline staff,” said Rathin Barman, Coordinator, WTI.
Over 17,000 frontline staff are insured for one lakh rupees under this scheme, to benefit their families in case of mishaps while on duty. The VRP has also provided training to over 8600 frontline staff in more than 100 protected areas and over 25 other wildlife areas across India.
