New Delhi : A demolition blitz carried out today by the District Administration of Gautam Buddh Nagar has proved a point to encroachers in the protected area of Okhla Bird Sanctuary. The existence of illegal structures were a cause of serious disturbance to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, which is only 4 sq. km in area.
The first alarms on structures in the sanctuary were raised in December 2004, following which, the Wildlife Trust of India undertook this Rapid Action Project that was conducted by the Biodiversity Conservation Trust of India. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed against the grant of fishing licenses in the river Yamuna, a crematorium and some construction within the protected area.
The matter was first heard in January, when the state of Uttar Pradesh sought three months to file a reply. On the 26 th of May 2005 , an additional application was filed to bring to the notice some additional construction activity for expansion of the original structures.
The Order passed by CEC on 30 th May 2004 directed the Chief Secy, PCCF, DM Gautam Buddh Nagar and Regional CCF, MoEF to ensure that no construction is allowed since it is in violation of the Orders of the Supreme Court in Writ Petition 202 dated 14 th February 2000 and a report was to be submitted to the CEC immediately.
Acting swiftly on these orders, the District Administration demolished all illegal encroachments that were causing disturbance to the habitat within the bird sanctuary.
