The camp, which was implemented under the Garo Green Spine Conservation Project run by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and World Land Trust (WLT) with support from the Meghalaya Forest Department and Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC), was organised in collaboration with the Asanang Primary Health Centre (PHC). The five villages that were catered to – Chandigre, Khalagre, Baladingre, Daribokgre and Sasat Sakal Aduma – are all of critical importance to the Garo Green Spine region where WTI-WLT teams have worked for over a decade, motivating and supporting local communities to set aside land for Village Reserve Forests (VRFs) to create better habitat and connectivity for wild animals.

The medical team from Asanang PHC was led by Dr ST Sangma and Dr MR Marak. Three hundred persons attended the camp: 53% were adults, 31% between the age of 0 and 12 years; there were more men (56%) than women (44%); the common cold, cough and fever were the most common ailments (40%), followed by gastroenteritis (20%); diarrhoea, clinical anaemia, skin infection and peripheral neuritis were other diseases treated. The WTI-WLT team, supported by the District Medical and Health Officer of Garo Hills, also distributed medicines free of cost to all patients.
