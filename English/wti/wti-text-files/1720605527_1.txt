Achanakmar, Chhattisgarh, 07 January 2021:
Wildlife Trust of India with the support of Foundation Segre recently carried out field gear distribution of winter jackets and water filters among the daily wager staff working in remote patrolling camps of the Achanakmar Tiger Reserve, Chhattisgarh. A total of 150 jackets and 25 water filters were distributed by Shri P.V. Narsinga Rao, PCCF (WL), Shri H.L. Ratre, CCF, Shri S.D. Sharma, Dy Director of Achanakmar Tiger Reserve and Dr Rajendra Mishra, Regional Head – Central India of WTI.
Achanakmar tiger reserve  is part of the larger biodiverse-scape of  Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere forming an essential corridor between Sanjay Dubri tiger reserve and the Kanha tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh. This large landscape provides for an important habitat for dispersing tigers and is vital for a genetically sound tiger population in the Central India landscape. WTI has been involved in capacity building of the frontline staff since 2014, through wildlife crime related trainings and ensuring our guardians of the wild continue their patrolling duties with a boosted morale post our initiatives.

The PCCF (WL) thanked WTI for supporting the field staff and patrol camps mentioning that this would significantly upgrade the patrolling camps which don’t even have drinking water facilities.

“We are thankful to WTI for providing winter jackets to temporary field staff and water filter for the field camps” said Ram Singh Baiga, Paidal Guard working in the Tiger Reserve.
This support was possible through Rapid Action Projects of Wild Aid, one of WTI’s longest-running programs. Rapid Action Projects aim to provide essential, short term and immediate solutions to tackle conservation emergencies.
