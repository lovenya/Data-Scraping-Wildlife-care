Panitola (Assam): An inebriated captive elephant was hit by a train and killed Wednesday as it strayed on to the tracks after killing one of its keepers in a fit of anger, officials said.
The elephant, which was intoxicated after it drank rice-beer that its two keepers were drinking, trampled one of them in anger when they tried to ride it.
The keepers were moving the elephant to Dibrugarh in near the Panitola township in the north east Indian state of Assam.
“The impact of the train was so strong that pieces were found scattered up to fifty meters.” Dr. Prasanta Boro of Wildlife Trust of India who conducted the postmortem, said.
