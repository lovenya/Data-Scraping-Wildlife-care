CWRC, September 27, 2015: The Assam Forest Department rescued a week old female elephant calf from Charduar forest range under Sonitpur West Division. The calf was later admitted to the IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (CWRC) on September 27, 2015.
The calf was found alone by the villagers of 13th Mile area who handed it over to the forest staff of Nameri National Park. The calf was then shifted to the Charduar Forest Range by the Nameri officials.
The forest staff tried locating a wild herd in the area for reunification, but there were no sign of any elephant presence. Owing to this, the calf was handed over to CWRC for veterinary care.



According to Dr Jahan Ahmed, the CWRC satellite station vet, “After reaching the spot, we found that the calf was dehydrated and stressed. We provided her oral rehydrating solution and on further investigation, it was decided that the young animal should be shifted to CWRC for further care.”
Following the initial veterinary observation, the calf was shifted to quarantine facility for overnight observation where it was accompanied by an animal keeper/foster mother to ensure that its vitals are stabilized.
Next morning, Dr. Panjit Basumatary did a body morphometry and provided treatment. The IFAW-WTI vet said, “The calf is under severe stress which may last longer considering its age. It requires intensive care which may gradually stabilise the baby. Now, it is under observation in a quarantine facility with a foster mother.” The body morphometry revealed that the new calf weighed 103 kgs and its shoulder height is 92 cms.
With her arrival, the number of elephant calves at CWRC has increased to eight.
