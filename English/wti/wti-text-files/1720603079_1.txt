Manipur: Deserving forest guards fighting against poachers and encroachers on a regular basis at the Keibul Lamjao National Park in Manipur will receive field kits from the Wildlife Trust of India in an effort to recognize their excelent work in the field.  
The decision, to reinforce the staff was taken after a proposal was received from Salam Rajesh, a member of the state board for wildlife to improve the working conditions of the field staff guarding this park.
According to Dr. Sandeep Kr. Tiwari, Asst. Manager of the Wild Species & Wild Aid Programme of WTI, “Six committed staff of the Park will be receiving these field kits in recognition of their appreciable services towards wildlife protection. The Rapid Action Project panel had cleared the proposal and the kits are being dispatched today.”
The park is home to the famous Sanghai deer (Manipur Brow-antlered deer), the only place where it is found in the world. It is also one of the rare Parks of the world which floats on water. Major portion of the Keibul Lamjao National Park floats on the famous Loktak Lake famous for various migratory birds and water fowls.
According to Dr. Rahul Kaul, Director Conservation, “The aim is to ensure protection of the park. Confident and equipped staff could only effectively enforce their duties.”
The Rapid Action Project was initiated by WTI to address wildlife emergencies across the country by helping the forest staff and other organizations and individuals involved in the rescue and rehabilitation of wildlife.
