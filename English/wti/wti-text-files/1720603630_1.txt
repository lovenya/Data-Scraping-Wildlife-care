Idukki (Kerala): Authorities in Kerala have busted a gang of ivory poachers suspected of killing a young tusker in Kuttampuza Forest Range, Idukki district, earlier this month. 
The tusker was killed on July 7, using a powerful country-made gun owned by one of the gang members, who was arrested on Saturday. The weapon used in the crime was confiscated from him.
Use of improvised weapons in killing large mammals has been documented in the past from across India. This particular gun’s barrel was made with a vehicle steering rod case.
A case under Arms Act, 1959, has been filed by the Kerala Police, after the recovery of the gun.
“We are set to ensure that the accused get a maximum punishment that can be awarded as per the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Their involvement in the crime will be proven with substantial evidence that we have collected,” said Manu Sathyan, Range Officer. They expect the accused’s bail application to be rejected.
Four of the gang members were arrested in an undercover operation by the Kerala Forest Department Intelligence Cell on July 16. All the accused are currently in judicial custody.
“The main accused, Aji, is known to be a habitual wildlife offender and is an absconder, who jumped bail in a sandalwood smuggling case. He confessed that this was his third elephant kill,” said a Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) official, assisting the Department. WTI is also assisting the prosecution.
