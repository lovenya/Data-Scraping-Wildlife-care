Birds are one of the most beautiful denizens of the natural world, and India with its diverse biomes has approximately 1300 species inhabiting its forests, mountains, grasslands, wetlands, along its long coastline (measuring about 7500 km). They play a key role in our ecosystem occupying diverse ecological niches. Bird walks and nature trails are proven  tools for awareness on environmental issues and the fragility of ecosystems. “The entire experience was eye opening for the employees as regular office goers experiencing nature in an urban setting. They came back very informed on various aspects of local ecology and informed on bird species” said Ms. Sonal Dhir, Programme Coordinator, Sustainability & Social Impact, Adobe India.
WTI is committed to corporate employee engagement towards environment awareness. This was the second nature trail, WTI has done with Adobe India. Nature Trails and Bird walks help WTI, a charity to raise funds for achieving its mission to conserve wildlife and its habitat.
