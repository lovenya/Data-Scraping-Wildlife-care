Pranab Bora, FR 1 of Salna Forest Range said, “Many birds were affected in the heavy rain and thundershower on Sunday afternoon, when their nest bearing tree fell. Local villagers first noticed them and informed the forest department. By the time we reached the spot 18 birds had already succumbed. We were able to save only these three.”
The villagers handed the three survivors over to the forest officials. Eighteen dead birds were found on the spot that was thrashed by heavy rain and thunderstorm on Sunday afternoon. There are several other nests in nearby trees too.
Later the rescued birds were handed over to CWRC-MVS team for care and observation and admitted to the center on Monday afternoon.

Dr. Panjit Basumatary, the veterinarian who inspected the storks said, “They are at the fledgling stage and moderately dehydrated, which may be due to starvation. Thankfully no fracture is detected.”

Necessary food supplement is provided to the birds kept in the center’s enclosure. The birds will be kept under observation till they recover well enough to be released in the wild.
