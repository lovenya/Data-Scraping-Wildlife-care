Plantation of saplings by students and villagers on the occasion of World Environment Day 

Ram Terang, Assam, June 5, 2015: More than 300 students planted saplings in the Ram Terang village and the site where the village would soon be relocated. The families living in the village voluntarily decided to relocate from Ram Terang Village — located within the Kalapahar-Doigurung (KD) Elephant Corridor — to a site near Sar Kro Village, as part of community-based conservation initiatives undertaken to reduce dependence on the corridor.

Students from Harlongbi College and Chowkihola LP English School from Karbi Anglong in Assam participated in the plantation drive. “I was delighted to receive a letter from the Principal of Harlongbi College who wanted his college students to participate in the plantation drive. In the last seven years, this is the first time that a college has requested to participate in an event like this,” said Dilip Deori.

Dilip added that the principal and lecturers asked to be a part of this activity and said that they want to join the cause. The event also saw participation from villagers of Ram Terang who were ecstatic seeing so many young boys and girls and their teachers join them on World Environment Day.

Voluntary relocation of Ram Terang villagers is the most important component of the WTI Project aimed at securing the KD Elephant Corridor. Supported by Elephant Family and Japan Tiger Elephant Fund (JTEF), this relocation initiative will help secure the corridor used by elephants to move between Kalapahar and Doigurung Nambor Wildlife Sanctuary in the Kaziranga–Karbi Anglong landscape.
