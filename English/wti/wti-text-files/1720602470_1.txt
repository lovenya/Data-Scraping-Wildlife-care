Sathyamangalam, Karnataka: Vigilance and action by a conservation worker with Wildlife Trust of India helped the Kollegal police arrest two persons in possession of a tiger skin, reportedly bought off tribals in the south Indian state of Karnataka.
On 1st September 2004 John Peters, who is working as a freelancer with WTI near Sathyamanglam in Karnataka came across the accused, Subramanyam and Balu in possession of a tiger skin. These two were on their way to sell the skin after having bought it off some tribals.
He immediately informed the Kollegal police, who took the two men into custody. “Both the accused belong to Kokkanakhalli village which is six kilometers from the Kollegal elephant corridor. However, the poachers, believed to be tribals belonging to Mavathur Village situated in Bylur wildlife Range , are absconding at present. A search is on for them,” informed Peters.
The Kollegal elephant corridor is a critical buffer link between the existing Protected Areas of the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary and the Chamrajnagar Wildlife Division in the southern Karnataka state. The occurrence of tiger poaching evokes surprise as the region has not been known for tiger poaching in the past and tiger population in this area is not high.
“Usually different traps or gunshots are used to kill the tigers. In this particular incident the tiger was trapped in a wire snare and was shot thereafter. The skin has three bullet wounds and its head is missing,” reported Peters.
Killing and trade of tigers is an offence which falls under Schedule I, Part I of the (Wildlife Protection) Act, 1972. It can earn a minimum of three years in prison which can extend up to a maximum of six years for repeat offenders and a fine which can range from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000.
