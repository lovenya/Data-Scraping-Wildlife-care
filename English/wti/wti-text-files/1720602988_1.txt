Kaziranga: Families of the deceased forest guards Golap Bori and Rajen Hazarika received rupees one lakh each as insurance money on April 26 under the Van Rakshak Project of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
The demand drafts were handed over to their widows Deepti Bori and Niru Hazarika by the Kaziranga National Park Director N. K. Vasu and the Divisional Forest Officer, Eastern Assam Wildlife Division Utpal Bora respectively.
Bori was on patrolling duty at Pathalikathani under the Dimoubhil camp when he sustained fatal injuries from a rhino attack on November 23, 2003. He was posted at Agaratoli in the Eastern Range of the KNP.
Hazarika drowned himself while crossing the ‘Deosar nallah’ (an open drain) on August 14, 2005 inside the park. His body was recovered two days later. He was posted at the Burrapahar Range.
This project was initiated in 2001 with the aim of providing training, equipping, awareness and moral boosting to all frontline forest staff across the country for better management of National Parks, sanctuaries and other important wildlife bearing areas. The project is supported by the Rufford Maurice Laing Foundation.
