Kozhikode: A tiger skin was seized from three traders in Kozhikode district in Kerala following an undercover operation by the Forest Department earlier this month. The traders have been arrested and a search has been initiated to nab the people who killed the tiger.
The operation was carried out by the Forest Flying Squad of Kozhikode division on January 1. The accused were apprehended from Venmani village, Kozhikode. The tiger skin, with a bullet mark on the left side of the neck, was recovered from the traders. Preliminary enquiries revealed that the tiger had been hunted in the forests in Wayanad. Investigations are ongoing.
