A preliminary physical examination being conducted by CWRC veterinarians upon the calf’s arrival at the centre
CWRC, Assam, July 6, 2017: A male elephant calf, about three months old, was rescued yesterday afternoon by frontline forest staff near Lalbarahi village under the Charduar Forest Range of Assam’s Sonitpur district. The calf was brought to CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park) for treatment and long-term care early this morning.
There are now twelve orphaned elephant calves being hand-raised at CWRC in the hope of eventual wild rehabilitation.
The forest department’s rescue team stated that the calf had probably been separated from its natal herd due to the flood situation on the North Bank of the Brahmaputra. As the herd could not be located, the Chief Wildlife Warden of Assam determined that the calf should be shifted to CWRC for its betterment.
The IFAW-WTI Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) unit from the Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) in Pakke Tiger Reserve, Arunachal Pradesh, responded to the forest department’s emergency call. CBRC veterinarian Dr Rinku Gohain conducted a preliminary physical examination and the MVS team transported the calf to CWRC.
Upon its arrival at the centre the calf’s condition was assessed by veterinarians Dr Panjit Basumatary and Dr Samshul Ali. “The calf is weak and its suckling reflex is poor”, said Dr Basumatary; “It is now under close observation in the Large Animal Nursery. The requisite treatment and care is ongoing.”
With two new additions over the past two days, there are now twelve orphaned elephant calves being hand-raised at CWRC in the hope of eventual wild rehabilitation.
