Bhopal: After a five-day journey covering 2012 kms, the male tiger on its way from the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) in Assam safely reached its destination, the Van Vihar National Park, on Friday evening.The four year old animal was accompanied by an IFAW-WTI team including two veterinarians and two animal keepers.
“Our prime focus through the journey was to ensure the animal’s safety and to minimise the stress on it. The weather was favourable for the most part of the journey and we’re glad that it is now in a safe environment,” said Dr Anthony Nokso Phangcho, who looked after the tiger along with Dr Anil Deka and animal keepers Lakhiram Das and Tarun Gogoi.
“With the arrival of this animal, the count of Royal Bengal tigers here has reached 10 and breeding among the big cats is likely to get a boost,” said SS Rajput, Acting Director of the Zoo. “This being a wild tiger will benefit the gene pool of tigers at Van Vihar.”
The tiger, Vivek, was rescued from a tea estate by the Assam Forest Department and IFAW-WTI veterinarians in December 2007.
“Of the 12 tigers handled so far by WTI, Vivek has stayed the longest in captivity,” said Dr NVK Ashraf, Chief Veterinarian, WTI. “While other tigers spent less than a year with WTI, Vivek had to wait for three and half years to get his placement right. He will now contribute to the National Tiger Conservation Breeding program at Van Vihar Zoo in Bhopal.”
