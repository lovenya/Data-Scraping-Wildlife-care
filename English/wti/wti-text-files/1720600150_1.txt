Animal keeper Hareswar Das feeds and weighs the female calf at CWRC
 

CWRC, Kaziranga National Park, July 15, 2016: A female Asian elephant calf rescued by the villagers of Chessa in Arunachal Pradesh’s Papum Pare district was admitted to IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) yesterday.

The elephant calf had been rescued on July 10 and taken to the Itanagar Biological Park for stabilisation, where it was placed under the care of park veterinarian Dr Sorang Tadap. The Arunachal Forest Department suggested that the calf be shifted to CWRC for further treatment and possible rehabilitation, whereupon IFAW-WTI’s Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) team in Arunachal Pradesh was called in. Veterinarian Dr Jahan Ahmed and animal keepers Doluk Dagang and Rali Nabam supervised the calf’s transfer from Itanagar to CWRC.

The calf is estimated to be around six months old. It is in fair physical shape but has several external injury marks of an as yet unknown origin that will require long-term care, Dr Ahmed said. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Banderdewa has ordered an enquiry to determine the precise circumstances of the rescue.

A health screening has also been conducted and blood and stool samples as well as oral and trunk swabs collected and sent to the diagnostic centre at the College of Veterinary Sciences, Guwahati.

There are now 11 elephant calves being hand-raised at CWRC.
