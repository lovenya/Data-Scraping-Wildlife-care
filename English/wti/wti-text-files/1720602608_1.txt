Pakke, Arunachal Pradesh:  A 13 ft long python drifting in the flood waters on the east bank of the Pakke river was rescued on Saturday. It was administered saline by the WTI veterinarian at CBRC to stabilize it and then released on the west bank near the Pakke tiger reserve.  
The Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) run by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) in partnership with International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) has remained unaffected.
After the flash floods that literally changed the topography of the East bank last week, the Pakke river has been hovering above the danger level. Although, another flash flood has been ruled out, people from upper and lower Seijosa are moving to safer places across the border to the neighbouring state of Assam . Two of WTI staff, Naim Akhtar and Prabal Sarkar have been forced to vacate their homes and are now staying at the WTI office, which is comparatively safer.
Prabal Sarkar apprised us of the situation from Pakke. “All the bears at CBRC are safe as the centre is situated on the West bank. The power supply line to the west bank has been disrupted following the collapse of the only bridge connecting the west and east banks. Currently the supplies are being ferried over by a boat that was sent by the Nameri National Park ,” Sarkar said.
The bridge in question is unlikely to be repaired for another 6 months. Meanwhile, WTI headquarters is trying to organize two inflatable rubber boats for the rescue team in Pakke since people on the west bank have to depend on supplies from the east bank.
Following a request from the Circle Officer in Seijosa, a joint Medical-Veterinary camp is being organized to provide health care to animals and people affected by the flash floods. Dr. Darge Tsering, the Mobile Veterinary Service vet from CBRC, will be spearheading the camp.
