Kaziranga: The six-month old rhino calf that was rescued a fortnight ago underwent a successful surgery for an abscess in her right foreleg yesterday. The calf had been limping ever since it came in and a team of four veterinarians at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) operated on the injury which was turning into an abscess.

The calf was rescued on July 21 from the worst flood that hit Kaziranga National Park in 20 years. She was found trapped in water hyacinth in the Bagori range and had sustained minor cuts and bruises, one of which had turned into an abscess.
The CWRC veterinarian, Dr. Bhaskar Chowdhury, said, “The abscess was 4-5 inches deep. Luckily, the wound was restricted to the muscle and the bone was not affected. The injury was on the carpal joint. We have cleaned the wound and removed the dead tissue. The rhino calf was administered saline after the operation. Since the operation she has recovered from anesthesia and has been walking around.”
The CWRC’s role has been crucial in the rescue and rehabilitation of animals during the annual floods at Kaziranga. The CWRC has been jointly established by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and the Department of Forest and Environment, Government of Assam and is supported by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).
