The male elephant calf rescued from the Amsorli area of Karbi Anglong, under stabilisation at CWRC’s large animal nursery on May 10, 2016.
 

CWRC, Kaziranga National Park: A male Asian elephant calf, estimated to be just over a year old, was rescued by the Assam Forest Department from the Ouguri Forest Range of the Karbi Anglong district of Assam on May 8, 2016. It had been wedged between rocks for 72 hours in the hilly Amsorli area when it was discovered by frontline forest staff. 
The calf was handed over to the Mobile Veterinary Service team of IFAW-WTI’s Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC). As forest officials from the Ouguri Range had been unable to locate the animal’s herd or mother, IFAW-WTI veterinarian Dr Samshul Ali, having assessed its condition, decided that it should be shifted to the large animal nursery at CWRC, around 220 kilometres away.
“As we reached the site, we found that the baby jumbo, tied up with a rope under a tree, was injured, stressed and highly dehydrated”, Dr Ali said. “Since the native herd had not been sighted, we decided to take the animal to CWRC for further care.”
The elephant calf is currently in fair health at CWRC. It has been kept in isolation at the large animal nursery and is being stabilised through oral rehydration treatment and milk formula.
