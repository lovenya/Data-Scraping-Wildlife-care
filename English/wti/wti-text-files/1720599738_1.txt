Kaziranga NP, November 23, 2012: With an aim to study the movement pattern of Eastern swamp deer, Assam Forest Department in collaboration with Wildlife Trust of India(WTI) and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) radio collared a female individual yesterday in the Kaziranga National Park.
 
The study aims to identify the population dynamics and threats faced by the rare species, especially during flood.
 
 It’s an on-going exercise which we are carrying out in the national park. The overall purpose of the exercise is to study the correlations of the species with the floodplain ecology,” said NK Vasu, Director Kaziranga National Park and Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF).
 
“The capture, immobilisation was performed smoothly with a refined anaesthetic as desired and the collar was fixed successfully,” said Dr Bhupen Sarma, Professor of college of veterinary science
Khanapara, who led the operation.
 
“During the recent floods in the Kaziranga National Park we had experienced the movement of the species within the park. The collar that we fixed today will hopefully survive till the next flood from which we will get more authentic information about the species during flood times,” said Dr Rathin Barman, Senior Advisor, WTI.



“The last collaring was carried out on May 23 in which we collared a male swamp deer. We got data of its ranging pattern and its movement particularly during flood. This time we have collared a female and we expect to collect data from her too,” said Aftab Ahmed, a researcher of WTI who is studying the species in the field.
 

The Oil and Natural Gas Commission Ltd has provided financial assistance to help conserve the rare species and signed a memorandum with the WTI and Assam forest department in 2010.
