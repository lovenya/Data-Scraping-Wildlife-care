Idukki (Kerala): The Kothamangalam Sessions Court, Kerala, has rejected the bail application of ivory poachers, arrested last month for killing a tusker in the Kuttampuza Forest Range in Idukki district. The hearing is likely to begin next week.
A member of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) who is assisting the Kerala Forest Department, said, “The court rejected the bail for all, except one member of the gang who repaired the weapon used in the crime.”
The accused had killed the elephant on July 7 using a country-made weapon. They were arrested in an undercover operation by the Kerala Forest Department Intelligence Cell on July 16. Another member, known to be the arms and ammunitions supplier of the gang, was arrested on July 25. The weapon used in the crime was recovered.
In addition to the charges filed against them under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, for killing a Schedule I animal, two of the gang members were charged under Arms Act, 1959, by the Kerala Police.
“Old cases pending against the shooter, Aji, will also be reopened. He had confessed that the Kuttampuza tusker was the third elephant killed by him, the first being in 2003. He is also accused in a case of sandalwood smuggling,” said the WTI member.
