As flood-affected hog deer move towards the higher ground of the Karbi Anglong Hills they have to cross the busy NH 37, which makes them susceptible to vehicular accidents.
CWRC, Assam, July 12, 2017: As floodwaters continue to rise, albeit slowly, in Kaziranga National Park, the Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) teams associated with CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga) have been kept busy responding to emergencies related to displaced wildlife.
Hog deer, which occupy the national park’s low-lying grasslands, are usually severely affected by the annual floods. As they move towards the higher ground of the Karbi Anglong Hills they have to cross the busy National Highway 37, which makes them susceptible to vehicular accidents.
MVS teams attended nine hog deer rescue cases yesterday: three deer were successfully treated and released back to the wild; three were found dead on arrival; two succumbed to severe injuries during treatment; and one has been transferred to CWRC and is currently under care.
