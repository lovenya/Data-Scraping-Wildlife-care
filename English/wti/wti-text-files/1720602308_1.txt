NEW DELHI: Poachers killed two rhinos on May 23rd in the Tuplung area of the Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Marigoan district, Central Assam.
The 2 rhinos, a female and a calf, were killed and the horns of the female rhino taken away. The animals were killed after they were electrocuted by wires that the poachers had set up near the Komarpur-Mayong road. Bolindo Bhairali, a forest staff member, was leaving for Guwahati at night when he saw sparks flying from a wire. Suspecting trouble, he informed the range officer of Pabitora. Immediately, a team rushed to the spot and found the carcass of the poached rhinos.
Later, a raiding team was formed to trace the poachers. It included the Range Officer, Zulfikar Alam, Officer-in-charge of the Mayong police station, Trilok Nath, Ravinder Singh, Ram Kumar Bhattarai and Gulab Nath. The Forest Department, along with local policemen, immediately started work on the enquiry. After 2 days of non-stop field raids, finally on May 25th, the investigating team was able to nab the culprits. The party of 5 poachers, of which one was arrested, belonged to a village close to Orang National Park, Assam. The rhino horn that had been taken was also recovered. Meanwhile, the administration has suspended a forest official of Komarpur beat due to negligence at work.
