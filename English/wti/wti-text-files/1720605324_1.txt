In a shocking development, Wildlife Trust of India lost Nagaraj Bhat, our veteran crime fighter from Karnataka in a road accident this morning.  He was on his way to an enforcement operation when the vehicle in which he was travelling, driven by a collaborator overturned several times in trying to steer clear of a racing bus.
Bhat trained in Electronics and Telecommunication but went on to join WTI in 2011 at the age of 44 when he felt his research job had its own limitations in dealing with challenges and threats faced by wildlife in India. He joined WTI as a Field Officer in Bengaluru with the firm belief that only by active involvement in wildlife conservation with proper enforcement and by managing human animal conflicts can one save wildlife in India.

Over the years he built his expertise in anti-poaching and wildlife enforcement and successfully led undercover operations as well as the anti-snare walks initiated by WTI in tiger reserves of Karnataka.  Up to his last position as Manager, Wildlife Crime Control Division, he also trained frontline forest staff through his career in various states on anti- poaching techniques. Known for his infectious laughter and enthusiasm for wildlife conservation, he was well respected by all.
Bhat was 52 and is survived by his mother, wife and a son in his teens. We at WTI are shocked and feel a great sense of loss at his sudden passing. While we come to terms with this loss, a young team member aptly surmised his personality thus: ‘Great men fear not when the end is near for they know that it is yet another adventure. He was a great man and a genuine guide.’
WTI salutes his spirit and his dedication for serving mother nature.
