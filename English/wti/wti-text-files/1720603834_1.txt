Salem (Tamil Nadu): Authorities in Tamil Nadu have busted yet another gang of wildlife offenders involved in illegal ivory trade, marking the third ivory seizure in less than a month in the southern Indian state. Six tusks were seized and one person was arrested in the latest seizure on March 13.
The seizure was carried out in Salem district, Tamil Nadu, by a special team of Forest Department officials, led by Kandasami, Deputy Conservator of Forests. Following up on a tip-off, the team intercepted the suspects near Mettur, Salem. Of the four suspects, three escaped while one was nabbed and six elephant tusks were seized from his possession.
Further investigation on the origin of the tusks is going on. Efforts are also being made to nab the absconders.
The Tamil Nadu Forest Department authorities, assisted by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) had earlier this month seized a pair of tusks in Hosur. Prior to this, another pair of 5.5 feet long tusks were seized in Dharmapuri, on February 20, 2010.
