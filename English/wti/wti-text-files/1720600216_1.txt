Kaziranga, February 15, 2016: Two Himalayan griffon vultures suspected of being poisoned were rescued by the forest staff of Sibsagar Forest Range from Demow in Assam. These scavengers were admitted to IFAW-WTI run CWRC for care on February 11, 2016.
According to Moneswar Duwara, Forest Beat Officer of Demow, “We were informed of sick vultures near a goat carcass in Gelapathar village. We immediately rushed to the spot and found that two vultures had succumbed while four needed immediate medical attention.”
The forest team shifted the four vultures to Sibsagar Range office where they were given necessary treatment by a local veterinarian on February 10. Out of the four vultures, one died and one managed to fly away.
The two Himalayan griffons were sent to CWRC from the forest range office on February 11 in presence of Dr Daoharu Baro, IFAW-WTI veterinarian, who was leading the MVS team.
According to Dr Baro, “The overall health of the birds is improving, but since it is a case of suspected poisoning these raptors will be kept under observation for another week.” As and when the birds recuperate, they would be released near a suitable habitat.
It has been noticed that the awareness level of the villagers is pretty low on the need to conserve vultures that are increasingly becoming victims of carcass poisoning. Demow is one of the important vulture nesting sites in India.
Since its inception, 65 vultures have been admitted to CWRC and more than 50 per cent of them have been released back into the wild.
