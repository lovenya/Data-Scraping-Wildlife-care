Bharatpur (Rajasthan): The family of a deceased Rajasthan Forest Department driver, Mool Chand, was yesterday provided support of Rs 1 lakh under the nationwide group accident insurance scheme for frontline staff run by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
Mool Chand, who worked as a driver in the Keoladeo National Park (KNP), died in a freak accident while on duty on October 19 last year. He is survived by his wife and two sons.
“Chand was one of the best drivers we had. He had been working with us since 1983 and had a very good knowledge of wildlife. We have moved papers to induct his elder son into service,” said Anoop KR, IFS, Director, KNP.
Soon after Chand’s death, the park director had intimated WTI to initiate the process for clearing the insurance amount. By January 11 this year, WTI received all requisite papers for insurance claim. The claim was cleared by the last week of January.
“Our heartfelt gratitude to WTI for the assistance provided. This is indeed a great help to the families of frontline staff, who face a lot of risks in the field. The forest Department too provides incentives in these cases, but that is not a huge amount. Although no amount would compensate their loss, these financial support measures definitely help them during these difficult times,” the Director added.
The insurance scheme is an initiative of WTI’s Van Rakshak Project (VRP). Over 17,000 frontline staff from 22 states across India are covered for relief in case of mishaps while on duty. Since 2001 when the scheme was launched, 53 families of frontline staff have availed of the insurance.
