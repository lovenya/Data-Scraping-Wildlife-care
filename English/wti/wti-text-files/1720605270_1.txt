Calicut, 17 September 2019: Wildlife Trust of India organised a quiz contest at Farook College, Calicut on 17th September 2019. The contest was a part of the Kannur Kandal project, focussing on the conservation of mangroves.
The Kannur Kandal Project – ‘Kandal’ being the Malayalam word for mangroves – aims to ensure the survival of existing mangroves and increase the acreage of such coastal wetlands across Kannur, potentially making it a prototype for other coastal districts in Kerala and the rest of the country. The project is executed in partnership with Apollo Tyres Ltd.
