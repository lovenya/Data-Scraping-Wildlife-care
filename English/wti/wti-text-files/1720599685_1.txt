The rescue team of International Fund for Animal Welfare-Wildlife Trust of India (IFAW-WTI) has been assisting the Assam Forest Department in providing emergency relief to wild animals during floods. Earlier this year in June, the IFAW-WTI team helped save a hundred animals during the month-long intense floods displacing wildlife in Kaziranga NP.



IFAW-WTI has issued an alert among its team members, bringing them to Kaziranga from their various project sites across Assam.
