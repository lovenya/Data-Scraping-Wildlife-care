She is not an earlier enlisted inmate and not a regular visitor like the wild gibbon which comes every day to meet his friend who is inside the enclosure. 
 
Her short stay, timed with the arrival of the monsoon, touched us. She is a spotted dove, who spent almost two days resting from one corner to the other here at the IFAW Wildlife Rescue Center in Kaziranga, India.

She would sometimes stay perched on the windows, inside the administrative block or on the pavement without fear of human presence. It seems she was requesting attention from us.
 
The juvenile bird was not well when she arrived.
 
Our veterinarian Dr. Panjit Basumatary identified her illness and caught her to give her the necessary treatment.
 
The dove had some sticky substance on her eyebrow that affected her visibility.
 
She gladly accepted and responded favorably to our care.
 
Her impaired vision may be why she fortuitously ended up here, at our center, surrounded by some of the best wildlife vets in the region.
 
The adorable bird, a short time guest at the Center just flew away before we tried to release her after the treatment this afternoon.
 
The “visiting dove” of the center has left us today with a happy memory of success.
