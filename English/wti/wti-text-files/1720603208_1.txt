New Delhi: Five deaths of the critically endangered Siberian tiger in recent months have raised concern among conservationists battling to protect their population in the Russian Far East.
Four tigers were killed by poachers and another died in conflict with humans in the region.
“Siberian tigers are driven out of forest due to uncontrolled logging and expanding industrial activity – resulting in habitat and prey loss.” Masha Vorontsova, IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) Russia Country Director, said.
According to 2004-2005 winter tiger census, less than 600 Siberian tigers inhabit Khabarovskiy and Primorskiy districts of the Russian Far East.
It is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Natural Resources (IUCN).
The Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is the subspecies and is used to hard snowy winters in the wild.
With only a few individuals remaining in China and an unknown number in North Korea, preservation of this animal has become important.
IFAW Russia has funded a project – Tiger Inspection Rehabilitation Centre – in Primorskiy to help rescue Siberian tigers.
“Within the last three weeks, three tiger cubs have been delivered at the centre – rescued from the Primorye region by a logger and a truck driver,” said Igor Beliatski, of IFAW.
“These tigers look like they are only about two months old which indicates they were likely abandoned by their mother. These tiger cubs did not have the skills to hunt and drink water, and would have soon died.” He said.
The cubs are now recovering under veterinarian and medical control. The pair joined a third female tiger cub which was rescued just a few weeks earlier.
In the year 2000, IFAW formed a partnership with Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) to strengthen the cause of wildlife conservation and animal welfare in India. The two organizations share concerns for a number of endangered animals.
