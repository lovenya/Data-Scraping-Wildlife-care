2nd June, 2024: SenseArt, a leading global art curation and installation design company, has launched “Searching for Wild Planets” – an art exhibition themed around global wildlife conservation in China. WTI is happy to be associated with the cause as the first installment of the regional tour kickstarts at Shanghai Jiuting Gemdale Plaza.

According to an official statement by SenseArt “We hope that more people can join the wildlife protection action, and we hope that all consumers can come to Shanghai Jiuting Gemdale Plaza to learn more about nature, wildlife, ecology, environmental protection and public welfare and work with us to protect our beautiful home planet!”. The exhibition was officially launched on June 1, 2024, with 50,000 visitors on the opening day. The exhibition will continue till the end of the month and we believe that the success stories from the WTI’s projects could raise awareness on the issues pertaining to wildlife conservation, illegal wildlife trade and wildlife protection in general.
