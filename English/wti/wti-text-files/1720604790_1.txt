Mr Alok Ranjan, IAS, Retired Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh, presented the memento and scroll to Arshad.
Arshad has been instrumental in educating over 500 community members as well as motivating over 50 farmers to protect sarus crane nests in eastern UP – a wonderful example of tangible grassroots conservation that compelled the jury to select him as one of the winners, said Dr Shailendra Singh, Director, Turtle Survival Alliance – India.
Since 2013, the Sarus Crane Conservation Project, run across 10 districts of eastern UP by WTI in collaboration with Tata Trusts and the UP Forest Department, has sought to involve local communities in monitoring and protecting this iconic bird and the wetlands that sustain it. “Arshad has been working with the project since its inception and has helped win community support for the conservation and documentation of 30 wetlands that are critical for the sarus crane in the region”, said WTI’s Dr Samir Kumar Sinha, Co-Principal Investigator of the project. “He has also coordinated with an array of stakeholders to meet the project’s objectives.”
