Chilla: With the active support of the Uttaranchal                            Forest Department, WTI has been able to put into practice                            a schematic feeding schedule for the rescued elephant                            calf Mahesh Yogi at Rajaji National Park (RNP). Latest                            reports from WTI volunteer Ms. Kadambari, posted to                            assist the RNP staff in rearing the calf, say that the                            calf has adapted to the new feeding schedules.
Mahesh Yogi is all of three-months was                            found by RNP staff in Kansrao Range. He had been abandoned                            by his herd when he was rescued by RNP officials and                            taken to the park’s captive elephant camp at Chilla                            Range on April 28. The calf was named by the Uttaranchal                            minister for forests, Nav Prabhat, after a pandit (Hindu                            priest) was consulted who said that the name should                            begin with "Ma."
Though Yogi is still at sea with his new surroundings,                            he loves to inspect every person who comes near him.                            He sniffs you with his trunk, which is barely one foot-long.                            And when he gets hungry, he bumps his head between your                            legs to indicate that he is hungry and its time for
his next feed.
At the mahout’s quarters, the calf has been housed in                            an enclosure next to Arundati, Rajaji’s 60-year-old                            working elephant. Yogi often mistakes Arundati for his                            mother and tries to suckle her, with little luck.
On May 5, WTI Wild Rescue Team, led by Dr NVK Ashraf,                            visited the calf. Its health was good and it did not                            seem to be suffering from diarrhea, umbilical hernia                            or other such problems. He has a hearty appetite and                            the chances for its survival are high if his feeding                            is monitored constantly and he is given constant attention                            and care.
"Elephant calves drink 2-3 litres of milk at each                            feed and the frequency of feeding observed in the wild                            is once every 60-90 minutes. Keepers tend to ignore                            this and over-feed them at each feed so that they can                            have a longer break. This is something we will have                            to guard against for the calf’s welfare," Dr Ashraf                            said. He will be visiting the calf every month to ensure                            that it is in good health.
