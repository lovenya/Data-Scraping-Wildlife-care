Kaziranga, October 30, 2015: A two month old female elephant calf has been admitted to IFAW-WTI run Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) on October 28, 2015. The calf weighs 88 kgs and was rescued by the villagers from a rocky pit in Rangalu area of Jakhalabandha in Nagaon district of Assam.
According to IFAW-WTI veterinarian Dr Bishwajit Boruah, “On external observation the left pelvic area was swollen and studded with lacerations. Also, the left hind carpal joint seemed to bend whenever she moved. However, an X-ray of the hind right carpal joint showed no evidence of any fracture. We decided to put a splint over the carpal area with a plaster cast to immobilize the joint and provide support while walking.”




Dr Boruah added that the plaster will remain on the calf for the next two months.
The calf has been shifted to the large animal nursery at CWRC and will be kept under observation of IFAW-WTI animal keepers. The animal has recovered from initial discomfort since its arrival and is now able to move around comfortably.
Interestingly, just two days before this calf was rescued, the Assam Forest Department staff reportedly rescued and reunited a female elephant calf about 500 metres away, in the same area where villagers found this calf. Villagers believe that this is the same calf that was reunited with the herd by the Forest Department on October 26, 2015. According to them, since the calf had a problem walking, it may not have kept up with the herd. On an average, one in every five reunion attempts fail.
With this new admission, the elephant calves at CWRC now number 11.
