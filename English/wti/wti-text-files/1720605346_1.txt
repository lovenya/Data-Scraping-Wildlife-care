Girsomnath, Gujarat, 27 January, 2020: The Whale Shark conservation project in Gujarat has been a long term commitment of Wildlife Trust of India towards Whale Shark Conservation with the collaborative efforts of Gujarat Forest Department and Tata Chemicals Ltd to safeguard the world’s largest fish and habitual visitor to Gujarat waters.
Our conservation efforts through awareness campaigns and community outreach got a recent boost by the inclusion of Whale Shark project in the 71th Republic Day celebration hosted by the district administration at Girgadhda in Girsomanth district of Gujarat on January 26, 2020.

Whale Shark Tableau was displayed to an audience of five thousand present on that august day at Girgadhda. Our 40 ft. life sized inflatable model of Whale Shark was the highlight of the tableau along with information on the project on a hoarding on the tableau. During the Republic Day celebration, key facts about Whale Sharks and the project outcomes were narrated to the audience by the master of ceremonies while the District Collector Ajay Prakash acknowledged WTI’s partners in the Whale Shark conservation project for their respective contributions in securing the life of world’s largest fish in his district coast.
Whale Shark Tableau inclusion in Republic Day by the district administration is a significant morale booster for all the stakeholders especially the fishing community reaffirming the need for the Whale Shark Conservation Project to stand committed for this project as they have for the last 15 years.
