The three Indian jackal pups that were rescued by an MVS unit late last month and brought to CWRC
Bokakhat, Assam, April 9, 2017: A Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) unit of CWRC (the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, IFAW-WTI and the Assam Forest Department’s wildlife rescue, treatment and rehabilitation facility near Kaziranga National Park) rescued three Indian jackal pups from a construction site in the Rajabari area of Bokakhat Town late last month. The pups, two females and a male, are now housed in a specialised enclosure at the centre.
The pups may have been separated from their mother when the pipe they were found inside was transported to the construction site in Bokakhat.
Two of the pups were discovered inside a large iron pipe at the construction site on March 23, while the other was found the next day. The Eastern Assam Wildlife Division was informed, following which the CWRC MVS team was called in.
“The probability is that they are from the same litter”, said MVS Veterinarian Dr Samshul Ali. “They may have been separated from their mother when the pipe they were found inside was transported to the construction site in Bokakhat. All three are healthy; we have placed them under observation in a specially prepared enclosure with a soil surface and a makeshift hole in which they can hide. We will wait until they are stabilised and begin demonstrating their natural instinctive behaviour before deciding an appropriate course of action.”
The pups are approximately two months old. They are receiving regular health checkups at the centre and a regular feeding schedule has been devised.
