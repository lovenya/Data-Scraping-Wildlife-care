The bird was rescued by a local NGO Mega Mix with the help of the Assam Forest Department staff on December 6, 2015.
On December 10, 2015, the forest authorities informed Dr Jahan Ahmed, IFAW-WTI veterinarian posted at CBRC, who reached the spot and brought the bird to CBRC the next day.
According to Dr Ahmed, “The bird was injured due to nest fall and a local rescued it and kept it in his house. There were signs of habituation and the bird is currently under the rehabilitation process.”
Now the bird is being taken care of at CBRC enclosure with minimal human intervention. In due course of time, it will be shifted to the rehabilitation site for release.
