Jodhpur (Rajasthan): The Rajasthan High Court Friday granted bail to Bollywood actor Salman Khan nearly after a week at the Jodhpur Central Jail where he was serving a five-year jail term for killing an endangered antelope.
While hearing the revision petition and the bail application filed by the actor, the Jodhpur bench of the High Court ordered his release on a security of Rs 1 lakh and a bond of Rs. 50,000.
Khan 41, was arrested Saturday, a day after his sentence was upheld by the Session Court in Jodhpur for killing an endangered Chinkara in 1998.
He was out on bail after the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Jodhpur sentenced him to five-year imprisonment last year.
“The High Court has taken into consideration of the two orders given by the lower courts. The outcome of the revision petition is with the High Court,” said Ashok Kumar of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
Khan slit the throat of a Chinkara he shot near a village in Jodhpur and then gave it to the chefs to cook at the hotel where he was staying.
Khan has denied his involvement in the case.
