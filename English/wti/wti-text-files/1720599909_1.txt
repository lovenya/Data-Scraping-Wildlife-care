CWRC, July 16, 2015: A week old female elephant calf was admitted at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), the IFAW-WTI wildlife care centre, on July 16, 2015.
The calf was found alone by the forest staff at the Orangajuli Tea Garden under Nanoi Forest Range on Wednesday around 11 am. The team searched but could not find the mother or the herd in the nearby area which falls in the Udalguri district of Assam. Thereafter, they alerted the CWRC Mobile Veterinary Service (MVS) team which rushed to the spot from Kaziranga.
The team reached there by the evening to take stock of the situation. The CWRC MVS team gave electrolytes to the calf to ensure that it isn’t dehydrated. Later at night, the team spotted an elephant herd and tried reuniting the calf, but it was not accepted by the herd.



Thereafter, Mr. Gajendra Adhikari, DFO, Dhansiri Forest Division, and Mr. S R Boro, Range Officer, Nonai Forest Range, handed the weakened calf over to the CWRC MVS team for further care.
Dr. Biswhwajit Boruah, the CWRC MVS veterinarian, thoroughly examined the young animal before taking it to CWRC– 350 kms away from Nonai Forest Range.
On arrival at CWRC, the calf was weighed and body morphometry was done. Presently, the calf is under 24 hour monitoring in large animal nursery.
