Scenes from the rehearsals and staging of the play ‘Why the river Manas dried up’ on World Environment Day, June 5, 2017
Chirang, Assam, June 06, 2017: In keeping with the World Environment Day theme of ‘Connecting People to Nature’, IFAW-WTI, in association with the Krishi Vigyan Kendra and Civil Administration of Chirang District, the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), and the Assam Forest Department, organised two street theatre performances with the students of Bahbari High School, Kuthurijhar yesterday.
“Through this street play we are emphasising the necessity of flourishing wild habitats and the role of people in destroying or preserving them.”
Based on the theme ‘Why the Manas River dried up’, the play was conceived by local artiste JP Das and WTI’s Head Veterinarian (North-east) Dr Bhaskar Choudhury, who also heads the IFAW-WTI Greater Manas Recovery project. Eminent local theatre personality S Mukherjee scripted and directed the play while D Bharali crafted the paper clay animal masks that the children wore.
The play was staged at Bijni College, Chirang District Headquarters, with the BTC’s Deputy Chief Kampa Borgoyari, senior officials of the civil administration, and about 600 college students in attendance. It was performed again later in the day at the Kakoijana Reserve Forest, where the local Rabha tribals are helping to save golden langurs in the landscape.
“Street plays have proven to be a simple but effective means of developing conservation awareness among the local populace”, said Dr Bhaskar Choudhury. “In this instance we are emphasising the necessity of flourishing wild habitats and the role of people in destroying or preserving them.”
